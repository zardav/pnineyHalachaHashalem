    Chapter Twenty-Two: <strong>Several Laws of Torah Reading</strong>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Establishment of Torah Reading
</h2>
<p>
    The mitzvah to learn Torah is a basic commandment, on which all the other <em>mitzvot</em> depend. There is no specific time for Torah study; instead, it
    is a mitzvah to learn Torah at all times, as it is written (Joshua 1:8), "You shall meditate upon it day and night." In order to strengthen Israel's
connection to Torah, Moshe Rabbeinu instituted the Torah reading on Shabbat, and in <em>Shacharit</em> of <em>Yom Sheni </em>(Monday) and    <em>Yom Hameshee</em> (Thursday), so that three days will not pass without hearing Torah (<em>Rambam Tefillah</em> 12:1).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Bava Kama</em> 82a) that this was instituted based on the verse (Exodus 15:22), "They traveled for three days in the
    desert without finding any water." Moshe Rabbeinu, and his disciples, the elders and the prophets, understood that the thirst for water was a result of
    three consecutive days during which Israel did not communally engage in Torah study. Torah is likened to water, for just as water sustains all that lives
    and grows in the world, so Torah sustains the soul. Since the nation became slightly detached from the Torah, the springs of water also ceased to flow.
    Although the Torah scholars of that generation most probably learned Torah during those three days, for three days the <strong>nation</strong> of Israel
    did not engage in Torah publicly. Therefore it was established that the Torah would be read every Monday, Thursday, and Shabbat, so that never again will
    more than three days pass when Israel does not publically read from the Torah.
</p>
<p>
    Ezra HaSofer further instituted that, for the Torah reading on Mondays and Thursdays, three people are called up to the Torah. Each person called up reads
at least three verses. All together ten verses must be read (<em>Bava Kama</em> 82a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 137:1-2; additionally, in    <em>Peninei Halachah Likutim</em>, part 1, 4:2-3, the reasons for this halachah are explained).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. The Torah Scroll
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah must be read from a kosher scroll. This means that it must be a Torah scroll written for the sake of Heaven, with ink on parchment, just as the
    first Torah scroll was written by Moshe Rabbeinu, according to the direct word of Hashem. Even a congregation which sets aside time for Torah study must
assemble at least every three days to read from the original Torah scroll, just like the Torah which Hashem gave to Moshe on Mount Sinai. If there is no    <em>minyan</em> present, the mitzvah of reading the Torah cannot be fulfilled, since it is a matter of sanctity requiring ten Jews.
</p>
<p>
    If the Torah scroll is missing even one letter, the entire scroll is invalid, and it cannot be used to perform the mitzvah of Torah reading. This halachah
    emphasizes the extraordinary quality of the Torah. Its entirety is one complete Divine idea which is expressed by all of its narratives, <em>mitzvot</em>,
    teachings, and letters together. If even one letter is lacking, a flaw exists in the absolute completeness of the Divine Torah.
</p>
<p>
    According to a number of <em>Rishonim</em>, it is permissible, <em>b'dieved</em>, to read from an invalid Torah scroll (<em>Rambam</em>'s responsa to the
    sages of <em>Narvona</em>; <em>Mordechai</em>). Still, in practice, the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> is that the mitzvah of Torah reading can
only be fulfilled with a kosher Torah scroll, and that is the halachah (<em>Rashba</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and <em>Rambam</em> in his <em>halachot</em>;    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 143:3).
</p>
<p>
    If, in the middle of the reading, a faulty letter is discovered which renders the Torah scroll invalid, a different Torah scroll is taken out and the
    reader proceeds from where he stopped in the first. We do not continue reading from the first Torah since, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, it
is forbidden to read from an invalid scroll. On the other hand, we do not require the congregation to repeat the beginning of the Torah portion, since<em>b'dieved</em> we rely on the <em>poskim</em> who maintain that the obligation of Torah reading can even be fulfilled with an invalid Torah scroll.    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    If a defect is found in one of the letters, and there is doubt as to whether or not it invalidates the Torah scroll, the reading is still continued from
    that Torah. There are two reasons to act leniently in such a case. First, it is possible that the Torah scroll is actually kosher. Second, even if the
    Torah does possess something which renders it invalid, we have already learned that there are opinions which maintain that <em>b'dieved</em> it is
    permitted to read from an invalid Torah scroll. Still, the Torah must be repaired promptly after the reading.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. Taking Out the Torah and Returning It to the Ark
</h2>
<p>
    It is customary to recite verses of scripture when opening the ark, when the Torah is escorted to the <em>bimah</em> (pulpit), and when it is brought back
    to the ark, as printed in the <em>siddurim</em> - each ethnic group according to its custom.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Ashkenazim</em>
    are accustomed to first say "<em>El Erech Apayim</em>..." which is not recited on days that there is no <em>Tachanun</em>, and after several verses they
recite "<em>Berich Shemei</em>." <em>Sephardim</em> are only accustomed to recite "<em>Berich Shemei</em>" on Shabbat and Festivals, though some say it on    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> as well (<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 134:13).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>chazan</em> holds the Torah scroll with his right hand, and when he says "<em>Gadlu</em>" he raises it a little. On Shabbat and Festivals he
    elevates it slightly when he says "<em>Shema</em>" and "<em>Echad</em>" as well. After that, he walks to his right to take the Torah to the <em>bimah</em>
    where it is read (<em>Rama</em> 134:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13). It is customary that people kiss the Torah as it passes and partially escort it on its
way. Most people are accustomed to kiss the Torah directly with their lips, yet some touch it with their hand and then kiss their hand (see    <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 149:1-2). It is not proper for a person who is sick, or has a cold, to kiss the Torah directly with his mouth, so as not to infect
    the other people praying.
</p>
<p>
    Before the reading, it is the task of the <em>gabbai</em> to prepare the Torah scroll at the proper place so that it will not have to be rolled there in
    public, because it is disrespectful to compel the congregation to wait. Generally there is no need to prepare the scroll, since the reading is conducted
according to the order of the weekly Torah portions, and thus the Torah is opened to the place where the previous reading left off. However, on Festivals,    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, and fast days, the Torah is read out of its usual order, and it is necessary to prepare the Torah scroll ahead of time. Afterwards,
    it must be rolled back to the order of the weekly Torah portion.
</p>
<p>
    If, by mistake, a different Torah scroll was taken out, the prevalent custom is not to switch it. Even though the congregation will have to wait until it
    is rolled to the place of the reading, nevertheless, that is part of the honor shown to the Torah scroll; once it is removed from the ark, it is not
    replaced by another (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 144:13). Some say, in order not to waste the congregation's time, it is permitted to switch a Torah scroll which
    was removed mistakenly, even if it was already placed onto the <em>bimah.</em> In times of need, when the congregation is strict about its time, we may
    rely on that opinion (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 37).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. The Lifting of the Torah Scroll (<em>Hagbahah</em>) and Its Return to the Ark
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> established that the Torah scroll be lifted and its letters displayed to the whole congregation. The original <em>minhag</em> was to
    lift the Torah before the reading (<em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 14:13-14), which is the custom of <em>Sephardim</em> and a few <em>Ashkenazim</em>, as well as
    that of the <em>Ari</em>. Most <em>Ashkenazim</em> follow the custom of lifting the Torah after the reading, so that everyone will know that the essential
    objective is to hear the words being read. After the reading, the Torah is displayed to the nation (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 134:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    8; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 17; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 9).
</p>
<p>
    The lifting (<em>hagbahah</em>) is so important, the <em>Chachamim</em> say (<em>Megillah</em> 32a) that the <em>golel</em>, referring to the person who
    lifts the Torah, receives a reward equivalent to all those called up to the Torah. Therefore, it is proper to give the honor of <em>hagbahah</em> to one of
the distinguished people in the community. Today, it is customary to honor even ordinary congregants with <em>hagbahah</em>, although the more correct    <em>minhag</em> is to give the honor of <em>hagbahah</em> to a respected person of the community. In any case, great care should be taken not to give the
    honor of <em>hagbahah</em> to someone who may drop the Torah scroll.
</p>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
    , at the time of <em>hagbahah</em> it is necessary for the Torah scroll to be held open at the place it was read, though if it was not, it is not necessary
    to lift it again (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 134:4). Regarding an Ashkenazic Torah scroll, the one who is lifting it must open the Torah so that it is
    possible to see three columns (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 134:8).
</p>
<p>
Some lift the Torah and turn it only slightly to the left and slightly to the right, and many people from the congregation standing in front of the    <em> bimah</em> cannot see the writing. The person doing <em>hagbahah</em> must make sure that all the people praying can see the letters of the Torah. It
    is best if he slowly turns in a full circle, thereby enabling everyone to see (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot </em>134:5).
</p>
<p>
It is a mitzvah for all the men and women who see the writing to bow and say "<em>V'Zot HaTorah</em>..." (<em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 14:14;<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 134:2). Many <em>Ashkenazim</em> are not accustomed to bow, and some <em>poskim</em> lend credence to that; however    <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is proper to bow when seeing the writing (<em>Har Tzvi</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 1:64).
</p>
<p>
    There are those who are accustomed to point to the Torah with their pinky while saying "<em>V'Zot HaTorah</em>..." and then kiss their finger. Some also hold
    their <em>tzitzit</em> and point to the Torah scroll with it, and afterwards kiss the <em>tzitzit</em>.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Geonim</em> introduced the recital of Half-<em>Kaddish</em> after the conclusion of the Torah reading, just as it is customary to recite<em>Kaddish</em> after verses of scripture (<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 147:9). So as not to interrupt excessively between the <em>Amidah</em> and the    <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> after <em>U'va L'Tzion</em>, only Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Ashkenazim</em> are accustomed to say "<em>Yehi Ratzon</em>" while the Torah is being rolled and covered, except on days that <em>Tachanun</em> is
    not recited (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 147:7).
</p>
<p>
    According to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em> and the custom of some <em>Sephardim</em>, the Torah scroll is returned to the ark after the Torah reading and
before the recital of <em>Ashrei</em>. The Chassidic <em>minhag</em> and the custom of most <em>Sephardim</em> is to return the Torah to the ark after    <em>U'Va L'Tzion</em> and <em>Kaddish Titkabal</em>.
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to recite verses of scripture while escorting the Torah scroll and returning it to the ark.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Torah Reader
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah is read with cantillation signs, that is, in a melody which suits the meaning of the words being read. Since the cantillation signs are not
    written in the Torah scroll, the reader must learn the signs that accompany the reading by heart. If there is no one present who learned the particular
    portion with cantillation signs, another person may look into a printed <em>Chumash</em> with the signs and whisper them to the reader, so that he can read
from the Torah with the proper melody (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 142:8). If no one is able to read the Torah with cantillation signs, it is permissible    <em>b'dieved</em> to fulfill the obligation of Torah reading without them (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 142:2).
</p>
<p>
    It is necessary to be meticulous in the reading of the Torah. If the reader errs in reading a word, such that the meaning of that word is changed, he must
repeat it properly. However, for a mistake which does not alter the meaning of the words, there is no need to repeat the reading.    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    Initially, it was customary that each person called up to the Torah would personally read his portion. For that purpose, everyone would prepare the whole
    weekly portion of the Torah reading. Alternatively, the <em>gabbai</em> would plan in advance the order of the people to be called up and notify each of
    them, so they could prepare their portions ahead of time. Yemenite Jews still do this nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    However, from the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, the majority of congregations became accustomed to appoint a Torah reader (<em>ba'al koreh</em>) who would
    read the Torah for everyone. The one called up recites a blessing on the reading before and after it, and the <em>ba'al koreh </em>reads the Torah for him.
    This way, people who do not know how to read the Torah are not embarrassed (<em>Ran</em>). This also avoids the possibility that people who erroneously
    think that they know how to read properly will be insulted if the <em>gabbai</em> does not call them up (<em>Rosh</em>). (See <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    139:1-2; <em>Peninei Halachah Likutim</em> I, 4:6.)
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The One Who Is Called Up and the Torah Blessings
</h2>
<p>
    Although every person recites <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in the morning, the <em>Chachamim</em> established that those called up to the Torah recite the
    blessings again before and after the reading, so as to instill a feeling of Divine reverence and awe in the heart of the one who is called up, and in the
    hearts of the listeners.
</p>
<p>
    Originally, the <em>minhag</em> was such that only the first and last people called up to the Torah recited the blessings. The first person called up would
    recite the first blessing before the Torah reading, and the others called up would not make a blessing. The last person called up would recite the final
    blessing after the conclusion of the reading.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequently, the <em>Chachamim</em> established that each and every person called up to the Torah would recite the blessings before and after their
    portion is read. The <em>Chachamim</em> were concerned that perhaps someone would enter the synagogue in the middle of Torah reading and would not have
    heard the <em>berachah</em> recited by the first person called up, and would think that no <em>berachah</em> is recited before Torah reading. Therefore,
    they established that each person called would make a blessing before his reading. Furthermore, they were concerned that perhaps a person would leave in
    the middle of Torah reading. Since he would not hear the last person recite a blessing, he would think that there is no <em>berachah</em> after the
    reading. Therefore, they established that every person called up would recite the blessing at the end of his individual reading (<em>Megillah</em> 21b).
    The fact that the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted blessings before and after each reading, demonstrates the importance of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> (see
    earlier in this book 10:1).
</p>
<p>
    During the reading, the person who is called up must read each and every word quietly along with the Torah reader. Since he is the one who recited the
blessing on the Torah, if he does not read it himself, there is concern that his blessings will have been recited in vain (    <em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 141:2).
</p>
<p>
    In extenuating circumstances, even a person who does not know how to read, or a person who is blind, can be called up to the Torah, despite the fact that
    it is the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (139:3) not to call up a person who is incapable of reading the written words along with the Torah reader.
    Nevertheless, the <em>Rama</em> rules like the lenient opinion, and even in Sephardic congregations it has been customary in extenuating circumstances to
    act leniently regarding this matter (see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 135:16; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 139:4).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. The Order of the People Called Up
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> established that a <em>Kohen</em> is given the honor of the first <em>aliyah</em>, a Levi the second, and a <em>Yisrael</em> the
    third. The reason for this enactment is "in the interests of peace," so there will not be any fights concerning the honor of the first <em>aliyah</em>.
    Originally, this establishment was only for <em>Shabbat</em>, for many people come to synagogue then, and there is more concern that tension will develop
    surrounding the <em>aliyot</em> on Shabbat (<em>Gittin</em> 59b). Nevertheless, the <em>Rishonim</em> write to practice this way on Mondays and Thursdays
    as well, and so it is ruled as halachah (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 135:3).
</p>
<p>
    If the <em>Kohen</em> is equal to the <em>Yisrael</em> in status, even without the enactment of the <em>Chachamim</em> he would have to be called up before
the <em>Yisrael</em>, for it is written concerning a <em>Kohen</em>, "<em>V'Kidashto</em>" ("You shall sanctify him") (Leviticus 21:8). Still,    <em>Chazal</em>'s ruling comes to establish that even if the <em>Yisrael</em> is greater in Torah than the <em>Kohen</em>, the <em>Kohen</em> is called up
first for the sake of peace. However, if the <em>Kohen</em> is an <em>am ha'aretz</em> (uneducated person) and the <em>Yisrael</em> is a    <em>talmid chacham </em>(Torah scholar), the <em>Rishonim</em> disagree as to the law in this case. According to the <em>Rashba</em>, the <em>Yisrael</em>
is to be called up for the first <em>aliyah</em>, since he is a <em>talmid chacham</em>. However, according to <em>Rav Amram Gaon</em>,    <em>Rav Natrunai Gaon</em>, and a number of other <em>Rishonim</em>, even if the <em>Kohen</em> is an uneducated person, concerning the matter of the
ascent to the Torah, he should be called up even before the <em>Yisrael</em> who is a <em>talmid chacham</em>, and that is how we practice (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 135:4).
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes, a great need arises to add another <em>aliyah</em>, such as on a Monday when two <em>chatanim</em> (grooms) who are both <em>Yisraelim</em> come
    to pray at the same synagogue. Since the first and second <em>aliyot</em> are reserved for the <em>Kohen</em> and <em>Levi</em>, if another <em>aliyah</em>
    is not added, one of the <em>chatanim</em> is deprived of the honor of being called up to the Torah. Although according to the <em>Rama</em> it is
permitted to add an <em>aliyah</em> for this reason, in practice it has been ruled that it is forbidden to add to the already existing three    <em>aliyot</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 135:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 3). The advice given is to ask the <em>Kohen</em> to leave the synagogue at the
    time of the first <em>aliyah</em>. Then, when no <em>Kohen</em> is present, a <em>Yisrael</em> will be called up for the first <em>aliyah</em>, thereby
    allowing both <em>chatanim</em> to be called up to the Torah that day (see <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 23).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. The Congregation's Conduct During Torah Reading
</h2>
<p>
    It is forbidden to leave the synagogue from the beginning of the Torah reading until its conclusion. Even someone who already heard the Torah reading is
    forbidden to leave. If one does leave, he offends the respect of the Torah. Of him it is written (Isaiah 1:28), "Those who abandon God will perish." One
    who must leave, such as a person whose only ride to work is about to depart, is permitted to leave between <em>aliyot</em>, for then the Torah scroll is
    closed and the offense to the respect of the Torah is minimal (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 146:1).
</p>
<p>
    In principle, there is no obligation to stand throughout the Torah reading, though there are some who enhance the mitzvah by standing, just as all the Jews
    stood at Mount Sinai (<em>Rama </em>46:7). Some are strict to stand when answering "<em>Baruch Hashem HaMevorach L'Olam Va'ed</em>" since it is a matter of
    sanctity, and the recital of a matter of sanctity requires that one stands (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 146:18). According to many, it is unnecessary to stand
    when the Torah is being read, and that is how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules (146:4). The <em>Ari HaKadosh</em> was also accustomed to sit throughout
    the whole reading, even when <em>Barchu</em> was recited (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 146:20). Indeed this is the custom in many Sephardic and Ashkenazic
    synagogues.
</p>
<p>
    From the time the Torah scroll is opened to be read, the people in the congregation are forbidden to talk to one another, even concerning matters of
    halachah (<em>Sotah</em> 39a). There is an opinion which permits a few brief words of Torah between the <em>aliyot</em>, provided that the exchange does
not continue into the <em>berachot</em> or Torah reading (<em>Bach</em>). Some say that it is even forbidden to talk matters of Torah in-between    <em>aliyot</em> and that it is only permitted to learn alone at that time (<em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>). It is good to be strict concerning this, because if
    people start to talk about matters of Torah, it will be hard to stop when the person called up begins to recite the blessing.
</p>
<p>
    It is permissible for a rabbi to answer an urgent question in the breaks between the <em>aliyot</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 146:6). <em>Gabbaim</em> are
    also permitted, during the breaks, to talk about essential matters that are pertinent to the prayer service. When there is no other option, it is permitted
    for a rabbi to answer questions even at the time of the Torah reading. Likewise, the <em>gabbaim</em> are permitted to talk about pressing issues which
    demand immediate attention; for instance, how to avoid insulting one of the people praying who expects to be given an <em>aliyah</em>.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. An Individual and a Congregation Who Did Not Hear the Torah Reading
</h2>
<p>
    Torah reading was established for the community as a whole, and does not apply to each and every individual (<em>Ramban Megillah</em> 5a). Therefore, a
    person who had to leave in the middle of the Torah reading and missed part of it, need not find another <em>minyan</em> in which to make up what he missed,
    because the important thing is that the congregation fulfilled the mitzvah of Torah reading.
</p>
<p>
    Someone who has the following two options: to pray in a <em>minyan</em> and leave before Torah reading, or to hear the Torah reading in a <em>minyan</em>,
    but pray individually - it is preferable that he pray in a <em>minyan</em> because an individual is commanded to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, whereas the
    mitzvah to read the Torah is a communal commandment and does not pertain to individuals (see <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 7:6 and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em>
    135:2). Likewise, even if a person who had to pray individually later discovers a <em>minyan</em> in which the <em>Torah</em> was not yet read, he is not
    obligated to go join them and hear the Torah being read there (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 135:7).
</p>
<p>
    If a person arrives late to synagogue, and when he is reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> or <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, the congregation starts to read
    the Torah, if he will have a chance afterwards to hear the Torah reading, he should continue to pray. However, if another opportunity to hear the Torah
reading will not arise later, <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is best that he stop praying and listen to the Torah being read (<em>Leket Yosher</em> p. 18;    <em>Yabia Omer</em> 7:9).
</p>
<p>
    If six people who prayed individually, but did not yet hear the Torah reading, assemble in the morning, another four people may join them to read the Torah
    (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 143:1).
</p>
<p>
Even if they only convened in the afternoon, according to many <em>Acharonim</em>, they may make up the Torah reading at <em>Minchah</em> (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 135:1). However, some disagree and maintain that the Torah may not be read in the afternoon. Nonetheless, in practice, those who
wish to make up the Torah reading in the afternoon are permitted to do so, and that is how many prominent Jewish rabbis practiced (    <em>Shut Yehudah Ya'aleh</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 51). Therefore, those who did not have a Torah scroll for <em>Shacharit</em>, such as a <em>minyan</em>
of soldiers or travelers, upon arriving at a place in the afternoon with a Torah scroll, may read the Torah and make up what they missed (see    <em>Yabia Omer</em> 4:17; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 135, note 24).

            <a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
            If the mistake is found in the middle of the reading, according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, the invalid Torah scroll must be switched for a
            kosher one, and at least three verses must be read from it so that the one who was called up may recite the blessing after the reading on the
            kosher scroll. If there is no kosher Torah scroll available, the <em>berachah</em> after the Torah reading is not recited on the invalid scroll.
            According to the <em>Rama</em>, if the reader reached a point at which it is possible to end the reading (which is not less than three verses from
            the beginning or end of a section), the blessing after the reading is recited on what he read from the invalid scroll, so as not to switch scrolls
            in the middle of an <em>aliyah</em>. However, if the mistake is found in a place in which it is not possible to stop reading, since it is not
            permissible to continue reading from an invalid Torah scroll, they must switch scrolls and continue reading from a kosher one, and the person
called up to the Torah recites the blessing after the reading on the kosher Torah scroll (<em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 146:4;            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13).

    <div id="ftn2">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
            A Torah reader who left out a word, even if the meaning was not changed, must repeat the word. In a case in which he omitted a letter from a word
            without changing the meaning of the word, such as saying <em>Haron</em> instead of <em>Aharon</em>, according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 142:4
            he need not repeat it, yet according to the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 142:2, he must.

            If he erred in his reading of a word and continued on a bit, he must go back to the beginning of the verse in order to correct the mistake in such
            a way that the text will be understood correctly, and from there he continues reading in order. If the mistake is made in the first <em>aliyah</em>
, and it is only realized during the third <em>aliyah</em>, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> rules (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 142, s.v. "            <em>Machzirim</em>") that the congregation must return to the beginning of the verse in which the mistake was made and then continue reading in
            order from there until the end of the third <em>aliyah</em>. If, after they conclude the Torah reading, they realize the mistake, they return to
            the verse in which the mistake was made and read it along with another three verses. They do not recite a blessing on this second reading, because
some maintain that <em>b'dieved</em> they fulfilled their obligation the first time even in reading with mistakes. See            <em>Peninei Halachah Likutim</em> I, 4:13-14.
