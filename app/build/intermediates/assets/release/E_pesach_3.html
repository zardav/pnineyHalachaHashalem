Chapter Three: The Mitzva of Getting Rid of <em>Hametz</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. The <em>Mitzvot</em> Associated with Getting Rid of <em>Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is a positive Torah commandment to eliminate all <em>hametz</em> from our possession before Pesah, as it is written, "Yet on the first day you must
    remove the <em>se'or</em> from your homes" (Shemot 12:15). The oral tradition teaches that we are to clear out the <em>hametz</em> by midday of the
fourteenth of Nisan, Erev Pesah. This ruling is supported by the verse, "You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice over <em>hametz</em>" (    <em>ibid.</em> 34:25), which is interpreted to mean that one may not slaughter the Paschal sacrifice while there is still <em>hametz</em> in his
possession, and the time for slaughtering the Paschal sacrifice begins at midday on the fourteenth of Nisan (see <em>Pesahim</em> 4b; MT, Laws of    <em>Hametz</em> 2:1). Men and women are equally obligated in this mitzva, as they are concerning all of the <em>mitzvot</em> of Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    Whoever did not remove the <em>hametz</em> from his home by midday of the fourteenth of Nisan is in violation - every single moment that he delays - of the
    positive commandment of removing the <em>hametz</em> (MB 443:1). Furthermore, from the moment the Pesah holiday begins, he is in violation of two
prohibitions: <em>bal yimatzei</em>, as it is written, "Seven days there shall be no <em>se'or</em> found in your homes" (Shemot 12:19), and<em>bal yera'eh</em>, as the Torah declares, "<em>Matzot</em> shall be eaten seven days; and no <em>hametz</em> of yours shall be seen, and no    <em>se'or</em> of yours shall be seen within all your borders" (<em>ibid</em>. 13:7). Thus, by fulfilling the mitzva of getting rid of the <em>hametz</em>
    we are saved from two prohibitions: <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei </em>- that <em>hametz</em> should be neither seen nor found in our
    possession.

</p>
<p>
    The mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em> is the first in a series of <em>mitzvot</em> connected with Pesah. As noted, <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is a
    metaphor for the evil inclination, and one has to clear out the <em>hametz</em> from the house in order to experience the sanctity of the Pesah sacrifice
    and the eating of the matza properly. Therefore, the first of the preparations for Pesah is removal of the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
2.The Prohibition against <em>Hametz</em> One Owns
</h2>
<p>
    The prohibition against <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is unique in that it is not only forbidden to eat it, but it is forbidden even to keep; whoever keeps it
    in his home violates the two prohibitions of <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    The Torah's language, "no <em>hametz</em> <strong>of yours</strong> shall be seen, and no <em>se'or</em> <strong>of yours</strong> shall be seen within all
    your borders" (Shemot 13:7), shows that there is no prohibition against a Jew having a gentile's <em>hametz</em> or ownerless <em>hametz</em> in his
domain. It says "<strong>of yours</strong>" - you are not allowed to see <em>hametz</em> that belongs to you specifically, implying that the    <em>hametz</em> of gentiles and <em>hametz</em> that is ownerless are permissible.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, if a gentile lives in a Jew's courtyard, even if the Jew owns the courtyard and the gentile works for the Jew, the Jew does not have to clear
    out the gentile's <em>hametz</em>. Similarly, if a gentile deposited <em>hametz</em> in a Jew's house for safekeeping before Pesah, the Jew need not clear
    it out, as long as he is not responsible for the <em>hametz</em>. However, he must erect a partition at least ten <em>tefahim </em>(handbreadths) high in
    front of the <em>hametz</em>, to make certain that he does not forget and eat of it (SA 440:2). Alternatively, he may lock it up and hide the key, or close
    it in a cabinet and tape the doors shut, so that if someone should come to open them, he will be reminded of the prohibition against <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, a Jew may let a gentile enter his home on Pesah, carrying his <em>hametz</em> with him. It is forbidden, though, for the Jew to eat with the
    gentile at the same table, lest the Jew forget and eat of the gentile's <em>hametz</em>. Even if he puts something on the table to remind himself not to
    take <em>hametz</em> from the gentile, there is still concern that a crumb of <em>hametz</em> may get mixed into the Jew's food. However, if the gentile
    eats at the table first, a Jew may clean the table thoroughly of all the <em>hametz</em> crumbs and then eat matza there (SA 440:3; MB <em>ad loc. </em>
    18).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. <em>Hametz</em> That Has Been Guaranteed by a Jew and the Status of Stocks
</h2>
<p>
    We have learned that one violates the prohibitions of <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em> only by possessing <em>hametz</em> that is the
    property of a Jew, as it is written, "no <em>hametz</em> <strong>of yours</strong> shall be seen" (Shemot 13:7). Yet, at first glance, there is a
difficulty here, for it is written, "there shall be no <em>se'or</em> found in your homes" (<em>ibid.</em> 12:19), implying that it is forbidden to have    <em>hametz</em> in a Jewish home under any circumstances. The Sages explained that, indeed, if the <em>hametz</em> belongs to a gentile, and the Jew has
    not undertaken the responsibility of its safekeeping and guaranteeing its return, then it is not forbidden to have it in the Jew's domain, as it is
    written, "and no <em>hametz</em> <strong>of yours</strong> shall be seen." If, however, the Jew accepted responsibility for the item, then it is considered
like his own, and the prohibition applies. This is what the Torah intended when commanding: "there shall be no <em>se'or</em> found in your homes" (    <em>Pesahim</em> 5b).
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, if a Jew guaranteed the return of <em>hametz</em> that was deposited with him, it becomes like his, and he is not allowed to keep it in his home
    or courtyard, but must return it to the gentile or clear it out. In a situation where he cannot return it to the gentile and clearing it out will cause him
    a loss, he should sell the <em>hametz </em>together with the place it is stored, to a different gentile (SA 440:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 4). However, if the
    Jew undertook the protection of a gentile's <em>hametz</em> that remains in the gentile's possession, then the Jew does not violate any prohibition (MB
    440:7).
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
Thus an insurance company owned by a Jew may insure gentiles' <em>hametz</em>, because it remains in their possession (    <em>She'arim Metzuyanim Be-halakha </em>114:29).
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, if a Jew deposited <em>hametz</em> with a fellow Jew for safekeeping, each of them is under obligation to clear it out - the depositor, since
    he owns the <em>hametz</em>, and the recipient of the deposit, since by undertaking to safeguard it he becomes like an owner (SA 440:4). Even if he did not
    undertake its safekeeping, he is required to clear it out.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    If one bought stock in a company that owns <em>hametz</em>, and Pesah arrived, if he has the authority to express his view about how to manage the
company's affairs - what to sell and what to buy - then it is considered as if he owns the <em>hametz</em>, and he violates <em>bal yera'eh</em> and    <em>bal yimatzei</em> on account of it. But if he is not authorized to express an opinion, then he is like everyone who invests in stocks - the company
    owes him a percentage of its value, but its property is not considered his, and he does not violate any prohibitions on account of its <em>hametz </em>
    holdings. Accordingly, those who invest money in mutual funds or pension funds do not violate any <em>hametz</em> prohibitions, even though the managers of
the funds may invest part of the money in a company that owns <em>hametz</em>, since this <em>hametz</em> is not considered the property of the investor (    <em>She'arim Metzuyanim Be-halakha</em> 114:28).

</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
4. How One Fulfills the Mitzva of Removing the <em>Hametz
</h2>
<p>
    We clear the <em>hametz</em> out of our homes in two ways: in thought and in deed, that is, spiritually and in practice. The removal in thought is done
    through nullification (<em>bitul</em>)<em> </em>of the <em>hametz</em>, declaring it ownerless and considered as mere dust. We do this nullification
    because we violate the prohibitions of <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em> only with <em>hametz</em> that belongs to us and that we consider
    valuable. One who nullifies his <em>hametz</em> and considers it to be as dust does not violate any prohibitions on its account. Similarly, if he declares
    it ownerless, he commits no violation on its account.
</p>
<p>
In addition to <em>bitul</em>, we also get rid of our <em>hametz</em> in fact. The evening of the fourteenth, we search the entire house for    <em>hametz</em>, and on the day of the fourteenth we eliminate it from our homes.
</p>
<p>
    Although each method independently is sufficient to fulfill the requirements of Torah law, the Sages required that we remove the <em>hametz</em> using both
    methods, to be on the safe side. Thus, we annul the <em>hametz</em> orally and physically clear it out of the house.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    On the one hand, the Sages did not want to rely on the nullification alone, lest some Jews not annul the <em>hametz</em> wholeheartedly and subsequently
keep it in their homes to eat after Pesah. Since they had not annulled the <em>hametz</em> wholeheartedly, they would violate the prohibitions of    <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em> by keeping it at home (Rashi, <em>Pesahim</em> 2a). Moreover, they were concerned lest, if <em>hametz</em>
    remained in the house, people might eat it by mistake. Therefore they also required removing it from the house physically (<em>Tosafot</em> <em>ad loc</em>
    .).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the Sages did not want to rely on the search alone, lest some Jews not succeed in finding all of the <em>hametz</em> in their homes, but then
    find it on Pesah. In that event, there is a chance that they might wait briefly before burning it - because they would feel badly for a moment about losing
their <em>hametz</em> - and, in that moment, they would violate the prohibitions of <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em>. By nullifying the    <em>hametz</em> before Pesah, however, they would not violate the prohibitions, even if they hesitated a little before burning the <em>hametz</em> (MB
    434:6).
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
5. The Essence of the Mitzva
</h2>
<p>
A fundamental question arose concerning the essence of the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em>: is the mitzva essentially to eliminate the    <em>hametz </em>actively or is the main principle that no <em>hametz </em>remains in a Jew's possession?
</p>
<p>
    According to the view accepted by most Rishonim (Maharik, Ramban, and others), the mitzva is primarily that one's domain be free of <em>hametz</em>. One
    who has <em>hametz</em> must clear it out, and one who has no <em>hametz</em> in his domain has already fulfilled the mitzva<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
    However, some Rishonim (Ran, <em>Tosafot</em>) imply that only someone who has <em>hametz</em> becomes obliged to fulfill the mitzva, and he fulfills it by
    clearing the <em>hametz</em> out of his house. One who has no <em>hametz</em> is exempt from the mitzva. Yet even according to this approach, we do not
    find that the Rishonim recommended acquiring <em>hametz</em> in order to fulfill the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em>. Nevertheless, there are
Aharonim who wrote that it is appropriate for one who has no <em>hametz</em> in his possession before Pesah to go beyond the letter of the law and buy some<em>hametz</em>, so that he may fulfill the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em> according to those who hold that one must actively remove    <em>hametz</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
In practice, Jews are a holy people and strive to perform the <em>mitzvot</em> in the most praiseworthy fashion, including making sure that they have    <em>hametz</em> on the fourteenth of Nisan, which they use to fulfill the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em> in a way that satisfies all views.
    Moreover, they are so scrupulous as to remove the <em>hametz</em> specifically by burning it, for, according to many <em>poskim</em>, burning is the
    preferred way to destroy the <em>hametz</em> (see below 5:4).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
6. When the Prohibitions of Eating and Benefiting from <em>Hametz</em> Begin
</h2>
<p>
The mitzva of getting rid of the <em>hametz</em> must be carried out by midday of the fourteenth of Nisan<em>.</em> Every instant that a Jew keeps his    <em>hametz</em> after that time he is in violation of the positive commandment to remove the <em>hametz</em>. Beginning at midday, the Torah prohibition
    against eating and gaining benefit from <em>hametz</em> begins as well (MT, Laws of <em>Hametz </em>and Matza 1:8; see also section 1 of the present
    chapter).
</p>
<p>
    As discussed above (2:2), in order to distance one further from possibly violating commandments, the Sages added to the prohibitions and forbade gaining
    benefit from <em>hametz</em> for an additional hour. They also forbade eating <em>hametz</em> for two extra hours, since on a cloudy day people are likely
    to err by as much as two hours.
</p>
<p>
    These times are calculated by dividing the day into twelve equal parts, each of which is called "a seasonal hour" ("<em>sha'ah zmanit</em>"). It is
    forbidden to eat <em>hametz</em> from the beginning of the fifth hour; it is forbidden to gain any benefit from the <em>hametz</em> from the beginning of
    the sixth hour; and the Torah prohibition against eating and benefiting from <em>hametz</em> begins from the beginning of the seventh hour.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, in practice, it is permissible to eat <em>hametz</em> throughout the first four hours of the fourteenth day of Nisan. During the fifth hour, it is
    forbidden to eat <em>hametz</em> by rabbinic decree, but it is still permissible to benefit from the <em>hametz</em> - for example, one may feed it to an
animal or sell it to a gentile. From the beginning of the sixth hour of the day, it is forbidden by rabbinic decree to gain benefit from the    <em>hametz</em>. From the time that it is forbidden for a Jew to gain benefit from the <em>hametz</em> it is considered as if it does not belong to him, so
    that he is no longer able to sell it to a gentile or to nullify it. The only way to get rid of it then is to burn it, crumble it and throw it into the sea,
    or scatter it to the wind (SA 443:1).
</p>
<p>
    However, the <em>poskim</em> disagree about when the day begins. <em>Magen Avraham </em>maintains that it begins at dawn, that is, from when the first
    light becomes visible in the east. The Vilna Gaon (Gra) maintains that it begins at sunrise, that is, from the time when the sun itself becomes visible in
    the east. The difference between dawn and sunrise is more than an hour; thus, for every <em>halakha</em> contingent on the hours of the day, calendars list
    two times. The earlier one in the morning is based on the approach of <em>Magen Avraham</em>, and the later one accords with the approach of Gra. This is
true concerning the recitation of the morning <em>Shema</em>, which must be done by the end of the first three hours of the day, and it is also true of the    <em>Shaharit</em> prayer, whose set time is until the end of the fourth hour (for more detail, see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 11:10 n. 14).
</p>
<p>
In practice, since the final times for eating and benefiting from <em>hametz</em> are of rabbinic origin, as are the sale and <em>bitul</em> of    <em>hametz</em>, the <em>halakha</em> follows the more lenient view, since in cases of doubt on matters of rabbinic origin the <em>halakha</em> follows the
    lenient view. Nevertheless, it is better to be stringent when possible (MB 443:8).

</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
7. The Procedure for Getting Rid of <em>Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
As we have learned, we clear the <em>hametz</em> out of our homes both in deed and in thought. The process of removal consists of four stages: search (    <em>bedika</em>), nullification (<em>bitul</em>), elimination (<em>bi'ur</em>), and nullification once again. The process begins with the <em>bedika </em>
    on the evening of the fourteenth. The search is aimed at ensuring that we have no more <em>hametz</em> in our home other than the <em>hametz</em> that we
    are keeping to eat and to destroy. Immediately after the search, we nullify the <em>hametz</em> for the first time; this is the removal in thought. The
    next morning we physically destroy the remaining <em>hametz</em> in our possession in deed. It is customary to destroy it by burning it. After the burning,
    one again declares null any <em>hametz</em> in his possession.
</p>
<p>
There are two more possible ways of disposing of <em>hametz</em>: selling it to a gentile and declaring it ownerless. As noted, one violates    <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em> only for <em>hametz</em> in his possession, and it is only <em>hametz</em> that is in his possession that he
    is commanded to eliminate. Thus, if he sells the <em>hametz</em> to a gentile or declares it ownerless, he does not violate any prohibition on its account.
</p>
<p>
Thus, search, disposal, and nullification are actions directed against the <em>hametz</em> with the aim of eliminating it. In contrast, declaring the    <em>hametz</em> ownerless and selling are not directed against the <em>hametz </em>to destroy it, but rather their aim is to remove the <em>hametz</em>
    from our possession so that we do not violate the <em>hametz</em> prohibitions. With the search, the disposal, and the nullification, we wage war against
the <em>hametz</em>, whereas by selling it or declaring it ownerless, we evade the responsibility it places upon us. These are all ways to remove the    <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Now that we have learned the principles of the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em>, in the coming <em>halakhot</em> we will explain the laws of removal
of <em>hametz </em>in detail. We will begin with the <em>halakhot</em> of the search for <em>hametz</em>, with which we begin our campaign against<em>hametz</em>. We will then continue on to the <em>halakhot</em> of nullifying and destroying <em>hametz</em>. Then we will address the laws of selling    <em>hametz</em> to a gentile for one who wishes to preserve the value of his <em>hametz</em> and free himself from the need to destroy it.

. Let us summarize the opinions regarding the times of the onset of the <em>hametz</em> prohibitions. The removal and destruction of the            <em>hametz</em> must be done by midday of the fourteenth (perhaps according to <em>Ha-ma'or</em> the mitzva begins at midday, but according to the
            rest of the Rishonim, on the Torah level the removal and destruction of the <em>hametz</em> must be completed by midday). There is a dispute
regarding the starting times of the other <em>mitzvot</em><em> </em>connected to <em>hametz</em>. Regarding the prohibition of eating            <em>hametz</em>, R.<em> </em>Yehuda maintains that the prohibition begins at midday of the fourteenth, and R. Shimon<em> </em>maintains that the
            prohibition of eating <em>hametz</em>, on the biblical level, begins at the onset of the Pesah festival. Most Rishonim adopt the view of R. Yehuda
            that the eating prohibition begins at midday of the fourteenth, but there are those who adopt the view of R. Shimon that the eating prohibition
            begins at the start of the holiday. Regarding the prohibitions of <em>bal yeira'eh and bal yimatzei</em>, most Rishonim<em> </em>are of the opinion
            that these prohibitions begin at the onset of the Pesah festival, while a minority hold that these prohibitions begin at midday of the fourteenth.
        </p>
        <p>
Additionally, note that one who participated in the Paschal sacrifice (<em>korban Pesah</em>) while he still had at least a <em>kezayit</em> of<em>hametz</em> in his possession, violated a Torah prohibition, as it says: <em>"</em>You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice over            <em>hametz</em><em>"</em> (Shemot 34:25<em>)</em>. If he was warned about this and still did it on purpose, he incurs the penalty of lashes (MT,
            Laws of <em>Korban Pesah </em>1:5).

            . R. Zevin explains in <em>Mo'adim Be-halakha</em> (chapter on <em>hametz</em><em> </em>and<em> </em>matza) that there is a dispute about the
            parameters of these negative commandments. According to Rosh (<em>Pesahim </em>1:9), any <em>hametz</em> that can possibly be seen, even if in
            reality it is not seen, would cause a person to violate <em>bal yeira'eh</em>. It turns out then, that anyone who is in possession of at least an
olive-sized piece of <em>hametz</em><em> </em>violates two prohibitions: <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>. However, according to<em>Kessef Mishneh</em> (on MT, Laws of <em>Hametz </em>and Matza 1:3), one who keeps any type of <em>hametz</em> in his possession violates<em>bal yimatzei</em>, but he would only violate <em>bal yeira'eh </em>if he actually sees the <em>hametz</em>.

            . The Rishonim disagree about these laws. According to Ri,<em> </em>the <em>hametz</em> is considered to be in a person's possession only if he
            accepted the responsibilities of a paid custodian. According to <em>Behag</em>, however, he is considered the owner of the <em>hametz</em> - and
            thus in violation of the <em>halakha</em> - even if he only accepted the responsibilities of an unpaid custodian. SA<em> </em>rules in accordance
            with Ri and cites <em>Behag </em>as "others say." MB<em> </em>(8) states that it is preferable to follow the opinion of <em>Behag</em>. According
            to Rambam<em>, </em>even if one did not accept any responsibility for the <em>hametz</em>, if the gentile is powerful and will forcibly extract
            compensation for the Jew destroying the <em>hametz</em>, the <em>hametz</em> is considered owned by the Jew, and he would be considered in
            violation. According to Raavad, he is not in violation, but the predominant view is that of Rambam. In all these cases, if the <em>hametz</em>
            remained over Pesah, one may eat it <em>be-di'avad</em>, since the prohibition of using <em>hametz</em> that existed on Pesah is only rabbinic, and
            in an uncertain situation we are lenient.

            . Regarding a Jew who deposited his <em>hametz</em> with another person, SA<em> </em>440:4 rules in accordance with R. Yona that even if the
            custodian accepts responsibility over the <em>hametz</em>, since the <em>hametz</em> still belongs to the owner, it is the owner's responsibility
to destroy it<em>.</em> This is the opinion of other <em>poskim</em> as well. According to Ramban<em> </em>and Ran<em>, </em>since the            <em>hametz</em> is not in the owner's possession and the custodian accepted responsibility for it, the owner of the <em>hametz</em> does not
            transgress any prohibition. As for the custodian, SA<em> </em>443:2 states that if the owner of the <em>hametz</em> did not come to collect it
            before Pesah, the custodian should preferably sell the <em>hametz</em> to a gentile in order to preserve its value. If he did not do so, the
            custodian is obligated to destroy the <em>hametz</em>. MB<em> ad loc. </em>(14) explains that according to <em>Bah </em>and MA, the reason for this
            obligation is that every Jew is responsible for his fellow Jew ("<em>kol Yisrael areivim zeh la-zeh</em>"). Gra's opinion on the matter is that
            even if the custodian did not accept responsibility for the <em>hametz</em>, he still has a Torah obligation to destroy it, as it is forbidden to
            harbor a Jew's <em>hametz</em> in one's home. This is also the opinion of <em>Tziyun Le-nefesh Haya </em>("<em>Tzlah</em>") and <em>Beit Meir</em>.

. There are those who are stringent in this matter and sell their shares of <em>hametz</em>-owning companies and companies that insure            <em>hametz</em>, and many <em>hametz</em>-sale documents contain a clause that includes these types of situations (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot </em>
            440:1).

            . According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, on the Torah level one method of destroying the <em>hametz</em> is sufficient: either by nullifying
            the <em>hametz</em> or by searching for and destroying the <em>hametz</em>. The Sages decreed that one must use both methods, as I wrote above
(1:1), in the name of Ran and as cited in <em>Beit Yosef</em> �432. However, it seems that according to <em>Tur,</em> the Torah's primary method is            <em>bitul</em>, and the Sages added that one must also search for and destroy all <em>hametz</em>, because of the reasons presented above.

            . To expand on this topic: According to Rema in 434:5 in the name of <em>Tur</em>, if one thoroughly checks his house and yet still an olive-sized
            piece of <em>hametz</em> remains, he violates the prohibition of <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei.</em> (This is why, according to Rema,
the main and most important "removal" of <em>hametz</em> in the Torah's eyes is mental nullification.) However, according to many other<em>poskim</em>, including Rambam<em> </em>and Rosh, anyone who checks his house properly, even if he does not succeed in finding every last bit of            <em>hametz</em>, does not violate any prohibitions for unintentionally having <em>hametz</em> in his house, since he did a proper and thorough
            check. Only if one finds <em>hametz</em> in his house on Pesah and intentionally leaves it in his house because he wants the <em>hametz</em>, would
            he violate any prohibition. Moreover, according to <em>Taz</em>, even <em>Tur</em> is of this opinion, as I have written above.

. <em>Minhat Hinukh</em> �9 discusses the different sides of the issue at length and notes that according to Rashi<em>, </em>Rambam<em>, </em>and<em>Sefer Ha-hinukh</em>, the mitzva is passive (this is also the opinion of Maharik in �174 and Ramban<em> </em>at the beginning of            <em>Pesahim</em>). According to <em>Tosafot</em> and Ran, however, the mitzva<em> </em>is an active one, and so according to this opinion, one who
            has no <em>hametz</em> in his possession should purchase <em>hametz</em> in order to fulfill the mitzva of destroying it. R. Hayim Soloveitchik
            offered a novel interpretation, namely, that this dispute hinges upon the dispute between the Sages and R. Yehuda regarding the method of
            destroying the <em>hametz</em>: according to R. Yehuda, the mitzva is specifically to burn the <em>hametz</em>, whereas according to the Sages, any
            act of destruction works. Those who follow R. Yehuda<em>'s</em> opinion, therefore, would hold that one must do a positive action to fulfill the
            mitzva of destroying the <em>hametz</em>; and this needs further study. See also <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 445:6 which mentions several Aharonim,
            among them the authors of <em>Helkat Yo'av </em>and<em> Mekor Hayim, </em>and Maharash Engel, who maintain that there is a mitzva for every person
to own <em>hametz</em> in order to destroy it; conversely, SAH<em> </em>(436:21), <em>Divrei Hayim</em> (1:9), <em>Havot Ya'ir</em> (�4), and            <em>Avnei Nezer</em> (OH<em> </em>318) maintain that there is no mitzva to obtain <em>hametz</em> in order to destroy it. As mentioned, the custom
            is to actively destroy some <em>hametz</em> to fulfill this mitzva according to all opinions. Indeed, MB (445:10) states that it is proper to leave
            a <em>kezayit </em>of <em>hametz</em> in order to destroy it actively and fulfill the mitzva of destroying the <em>hametz</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            The reason we have written that one needs a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> to fulfill this mitzva is that according to many <em>poskim</em>
            only an olive's bulk must be destroyed (see MB 442:33). Even according to those who adopt the stringent view that less than a <em>kezayit </em>must
            be destroyed, this is probably because of the concern that one may come to eat it and violate the prohibition of eating <em>hametz</em>, which
applies even to a piece smaller than an olive. According to the overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em>, however, there is no Torah prohibition of<em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em> on a piece of <em>hametz</em> smaller than an olive (see <em>Dagul Mei-rvava </em>�442,<em> Hakham Zvi </em>�86, and<em> Sha'agat Aryeh </em>�81). This is significant since most authorities believe that the mitzva to destroy the<em>hametz</em> is connected to the prohibition of <em>bal yeira'eh</em> and<em> bal yimatzei</em>, not the prohibition of eating the            <em>hametz</em>. See also <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 15:4, which states that one should not pour lighter fluid on the <em>hametz</em> itself
            at the time of burning; rather, he should pour it onto the wood, so that the <em>hametz</em> is destroyed by fire itself and not ruined by the
            lighter fluid. <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 8:10 n. 17 explains that there is no reason to be stringent about this, since the main point of the
            burning is to turn the <em>hametz</em> into ashes, regardless of whether or not the taste of the <em>hametz</em> is ruined.

            . A question arises regarding one who is in Israel and owns <em>hametz</em> in America, and he wants to sell his <em>hametz</em>. The issue is
            whether the end of the fifth hour (until when the <em>hametz</em> can be sold) is determined according to the location of the person or the
            location of the <em>hametz</em>, a discrepancy in this case of around seven hours after the end of the time for nullification (and selling) in
            Israel. According to most <em>poskim</em>, we follow the location of the person, although there are some who maintain that one should follow the
            location of the <em>hametz</em>. Preferably, one should follow the earlier time, but if this is not possible, we follow the location of the person.
            This is the view of <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 4:94-95. See also the <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 443:1 which summarizes the opinions.

        <p align="left">
            The first opinion is quoted in the name of MA, even though the author himself was unsure. <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> ch. 8 n. 4 summarizes the
            topic of the Jewish time calculations. See also Rema 443:1 and MB<em> ad loc.</em> 9, stating that according to <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> this
            particular issue is assessed using fixed hours, not seasonal hours, and in a situation of large losses, it is permissible to rely on this opinion.
            In <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 8:4 in the notes, the author explains what to do in extenuating circumstances where a person forgot to sell or
            nullify his <em>hametz</em><em> </em>by the end of the fifth hour.
