    Chapter Twenty-Four: <strong>The <em>Minchah</em> Prayer</strong>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. Its Objective
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> said, "A person should always be conscientious concerning the <em>Minchah </em>prayer, for indeed, Eliyahu was only answered through
the <em>Minchah</em> prayer" (<em>Berachot</em> 6b). One must be especially careful to pray <em>Minchah</em>, since it is unlike <em>Shacharit</em> and    <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> whose times are specified: <em>Shacharit</em> - immediately after waking up from oneâ€™s sleep; and <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> â€" upon returning home.
    At <em>Minchah</em> time, a person is often preoccupied with his affairs; therefore he must overcome his concerns and designate time to pray.
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, the purpose of the <em>Minchah</em> prayer is to sanctify a personâ€™s daily work in the face of all obstacles and difficulties, accusers and
    prosecutors. Therefore, specifically through his <em>Minchah</em> prayer, Eliyahu was answered in his battle against the <em>Baâ€™al</em> worshipers.
</p>
<p>
    In the <em>Minchah</em> prayer a person infuses his daily life with holiness, lending an added sanctification of Hashemâ€™s Name to the day. Perhaps for that
    reason this prayer is named "<em>Minchah</em>," meaning donation and gift. By praying <em>Shacharit</em>, we fulfill our obligation to thank Hashem for all
    the good He has given us, and in <em>Minchah</em> we add more prayers. <em>Shacharit</em> refers to everything that Hashem has given us in His abundant
    graciousness, and <em>Minchah</em> arises from our daily actions.
</p>

    2. The Order of the Prayer
</h2>
<p>
The majority of <em>Geonim</em> and <em>Rishonim</em> maintain that there is no need to recite the passages of the <em>Korbanot</em> before praying    <em>Minchah</em>. Neither the <em>Rambam</em> (<em>Hilchot Tefillah</em> 9:8), nor the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> mention that <em>Korbanot</em> are recited
    at <em>Minchah</em>. Still, there are <em>Rishonim</em> who write that the passages of the <em>Tamid</em> and the <em>Pitum</em> <em>HaKetoret</em> are
    recited before <em>Minchah</em>, just as it is proper to say them before <em>Shacharit</em> (<em>Rama</em> 234:1; 132:2). Those who follow the <em>Ari</em>
    are more meticulous about reciting <em>Korbanot</em> before <em>Minchah</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 232:6; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 234:1).
</p>
<p>
    All are accustomed to saying <em>Tehillah Lâ€™David</em> (<em>Ashrei</em>) before the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Minchah</em> because it is proper to praise
    Hashem prior to praying the <em>Amidah</em>. It is, indeed, a kind of <em>Pesukei dâ€™Zimrah</em> before the <em>Minchah</em> prayer (see earlier in this
book 14:1-2). However, it is not an absolute obligation to recite it before <em>Minchah</em>, and therefore, in a situation in which the time to pray    <em>Minchah</em> is about to lapse, one must skip <em>Tehillah Lâ€™David</em> and immediately start reciting the <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    234:6). Likewise, if the congregation is ready to begin the <em>Amidah</em>, he should skip <em>Tehillah Lâ€™David</em> so that he can start praying together
    with them in a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:14; <em>Or Lâ€™Tzion</em>, part 2, 15:3).
</p>
<p>
    After <em>Tehillah Lâ€™David</em> the <em>chazan</em> recites Half-<em>Kaddish</em>, following which the congregations begins the silent <em>Amidah</em>.
Subsequently, the <em>chazan</em> says <em>Chazarat</em> <em>HaShatz</em>. <em>Birkat</em> <em>Kohanim</em> is not recited in <em>Chazarat</em>    <em>HaShatz</em> of <em>Minchah</em>, for fear that perhaps the <em>Kohanim</em> drank wine at the meal beforehand and will come to bless the nation when
    they are inebriated. However, on a public fast day, there is no such concern, and therefore they bless the nation then (on condition that the congregation
    prays after <em>plag haminchah</em>, as explained earlier in this book 20:5).
</p>
<p>
    After the <em>Amidah</em>, prayers of supplication (<em>Tachanunim</em>) are recited. According to the Sephardic custom, <em>Vidui</em>, the Thirteen
Attributes of Mercy, and <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> are all said; whereas according to the Ashkenazic and Yemenite (Baladi) <em>minhag</em>, only    <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> is recited. Subsequently, the <em>chazan</em> says <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>. On days on which <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited
    (as explained earlier in this book 21:7-8), the <em>chazan</em> recites <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> immediately following the <em>Amidah</em> repetition.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Sephardim</em>
say "<em>Lamenatzeâ€™ach Binâ€™ginot</em>" (Psalm 67) followed by Mournerâ€™s <em>Kaddish</em>, and conclude the prayer with <em>Aleinu Lâ€™Shabeâ€™ach</em>.    <em>Ashkenazim</em> do not recite <em>Lamenatzeâ€™ach</em>. They say <em>Aleinu Lâ€™Shabeâ€™ach </em>and then Mournerâ€™s <em>Kaddish</em>.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. <em>Minchah</em> Time Corresponds to the Time of the <em>Tamid</em> Offering
</h2>
<p>
The <em>Chachamim</em> established the time of the <em>Minchah</em> prayer to correspond to the afternoon <em>Tamid</em>. In principle, the time of the    <em>Tamid</em> offering starts after six hours into the day, for that marks <em>chatzot</em> (midday), and the sun then begins to descend towards the west.
    However, the <em>Chachamim</em> were concerned that perhaps an incorrect estimation would be made regarding the position of the sun; therefore they
    established that the <em>Tamid</em> can only be offered half an hour later, which means that the time of <em>Minchah</em> starts at six-and-a-half hours
    into the day.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    In actuality, the <em>Tamid</em> offering was the final offering of the day, after which it was not permissible to offer burnt offerings, peace offerings,
    sin offerings, or guilt offerings. Therefore, it was customary to delay bringing the afternoon <em>Tamid</em> offering until after nine-and-a-half hours of
    the day already passed.
</p>
<p>
    Only when <em>Erev Pesach</em> fell on <em>Erev Shabbat</em> was the <em>Tamid</em> brought immediately after six-and-a-half hours into the day. The reason
    for this is because the time to bring the Pesach offering is after the time of the <em>Tamid</em>, and in order for all of Israel to succeed in bringing
    their Pesach offerings before Shabbat arrived, it was necessary to make the time of the <em>Tamid </em>offering<em> </em>as early as possible.
</p>
<p>
That is the basis for the division of <em>Minchah</em> time into two parts: "<em>Minchah Gedolah</em>" (large <em>Minchah</em>) and "    <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>" (small <em>Minchah</em>). <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> starts from six-and-a-half hours and lasts until nine-and-a-half hours, and in
principle, it is the proper time to bring the <em>Tamid</em> offering. However, in actuality, only in rare cases is the <em>Tamid</em> brought at    <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>. <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> lasts from nine-and-a-half hours until the end of twelve hours, meaning, until the end of the day,
    within which time the <em>Tamid</em> of the afternoon was offered. The first <em>Minchah</em> period is named "<em>Gedolah</em>" (large) since its duration
    is longer - three hours; the second, whose time is two-and-a-half hours, is called "<em>Ketanah</em>" (small). As we already learned, these hours are
    proportional hours. The day is divided into twelve parts and each part is called a proportional hour. In the summer, when the day is long, the hours are
    long as well, and in wintertime, when the day is short, the hours are concurrently short (see earlier in this book 11:10).
</p>
<p>
    Since the <em>Tamid</em> offering was actually brought at <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>, it is the opinion of the <em>Rambam</em> that <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it
    is necessary to recite <em>Minchah</em> at that time, and it is only permissible <em>bâ€™dieved</em> to fulfill oneâ€™s obligation of <em>Minchah</em> at the
    time of <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>. That is also how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules (233:1). However, others maintain that since, in principle, the time
of the <em>Tamid</em> starts six-and-a-half hours into the day, it is permissible <em>l'chatchilah</em> to recite <em>Minchah</em> at the time of    <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> (<em>Rif</em> and <em>Rosh</em>). Some say that it is even proper <em>l'chatchilah</em> to pray <em>Minchah</em> as early as
    possible, for those who are expeditious perform <em>mitzvot</em> as soon as they can (<em>Rasag</em>).
</p>
<p>
In practice, it is preferable to pray at the time of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>. However, in times of need, it is permissible <em>l'chatchilah</em> to pray    <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>. For example, if one has two options: to pray <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> in a <em>minyan</em>, or <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>
    individually, it is preferable that he prays <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> in a <em>minyan</em>. Similarly, one who is accustomed to eating lunch after the time
    of <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>, even though he is allowed to rely on those who are lenient and permit eating before <em>Minchah</em> (as explained in halachah
6), nevertheless, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is better that he prays in a <em>minyan</em> before that, as practiced in many <em>yeshivot</em>.    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. The Final Time to Recite <em>Minchah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The time to pray <em>Minchah</em> lasts until evening; however, the <em>poskim</em> disagree about the exact final time. The disagreement lies in the
    question: when did the time to sacrifice the afternoon <em>Tamid</em> offering end? Some say that the time to throw the blood of the <em>Tamid</em> upon
the altar was only until sunset, and therefore it is permissible to recite <em>Minchah</em> until sunset (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu</em> <em>Yonah</em>, the<em>Gra</em>, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 233:14). Others say that the time of <em>Minchah</em> lasts until nightfall, since the time of the afternoon    <em>Tamid</em> service lasted until night, whether it was for the throwing of its blood, or the offering of its fats and the raising of its libation - and
    that is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch Rama</em> 233:1).<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
In practice, one must try to finish reciting <em>Minchah</em> before sunset. However, <em>bâ€™dieved</em>, one may rely on the opinion of the majority of    <em>poskim</em> and pray within another thirteen-and-a-half minutes after sunset, for all opinions agree that night does not begin until then.
</p>
<p>
It is even permissible to recite the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy and <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> in those thirteen-and-a-half minutes after sunset (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:17; <em>Yechaveh Daâ€™at</em> 6:7).<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    Concerning the option of either praying individually before sunset or with a congregation after sunset, there are differing opinions. Some say it is
    preferable to pray individually before sunset, although most <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is preferable to pray in a congregation even after sunset.
</p>
<p>
    There are those who say that a <em>minyan</em> that began to pray late may not forgo<em> Chazarat HaShatz</em>, even if it is recited after sunset. Others
say that it is best to skip <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> so as not to recite it after sunset. In this case, the <em>chazan</em> starts to pray the first three    <em>berachot</em> of the <em>Amidah </em>out loud, in order to grant the people praying the merit of reciting <em>Kedushah</em>. According to halachah,
there is room for both opinions, and when there is a rabbi present, he must be the one to resolve this matter.    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. Forbidden Activities Before <em>Minchah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    To ensure the recital of the <em>Minchah</em> prayer, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted that from the time of <em>chatzot</em> onward, a person must be
    careful not to begin activities that will likely cause him to be so distracted that he will forget to pray. Therefore, one may not start work that will be
    difficult to stop in the middle, and will likely continue past the end of the time to pray. Likewise, he may not begin work that might create a problem
    which, in order to fix it, would require continuing past the final time to pray. One may not shop if the shopping may last until after the final time to
    pray. Similarly, one may not swim in a pool when there is concern that he might remain there until the time to pray ends.
</p>
<p>
    However, in a situation in which there is no concern that he will forget to recite <em>Minchah</em>, these activities are permitted. For instance, a person
    is permitted to start any type of work if he is in a place where he will be called to pray <em>Minchah</em>. Similarly, one is allowed to begin all kinds
    of work when he knows that the workplace will close before <em>Minchah</em> time passes. It is also permissible to shop in a place where they call people
    to pray <em>Minchah</em> in a <em>minyan</em>, or when one asks his friend to remind him to pray <em>Minchah</em>. Likewise, it is permissible to swim in a
    place when the pool is closed before the time to recite <em>Minchah</em> lapses; or when a person normally swims at a certain set time, and there is no
    concern that he will be tempted to stay past <em>Minchah</em> time.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
If a person began doing something that is likely to continue a long time, and he estimates that he will finish before the final time to recite    <em>Minchah</em>, since he already began the activity, he is not required to stop in the middle. Instead, he prays upon the conclusion of his activity.
However, if it seems to him that what he is doing will continue past the end of <em>Minchah</em> time, he must stop immediately and pray.    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    Although the <em>Chachamim</em> forbade getting haircuts at the time of <em>Minchah</em>, nowadays the <em>Acharonim</em> permit cutting oneâ€™s hair even
    after the time to recite <em>Minchah</em> has begun (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 232:6; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 14). This is because haircuts today are completed
    in a very short amount of time and there is no concern that perhaps a problem will occur with the scissors or the shaver, since every barber has several
    haircutting kits.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. A Meal Before<em> Minchah</em>
</h2>
<p>
Beginning at <em>chatzot</em>, a person must be careful not to forget to pray <em>Minchah</em>; therefore, he may not start a large feast before reciting<em>Minchah</em>. A large feast is one in which many people partake, such as meals which accompany a <em>brit milah</em>, <em>sheva berachot</em>, and a    <em>pidyon haben</em>. However, a<em> </em>Shabbat meal is not considered a large feast. In extenuating circumstances, it is permitted to begin a large
feast before praying <em>Minchah</em>, on condition that it is clear to those who are eating that they will surely end the feast before the time to pray    <em>Minchah</em> lapses, and that they will remind one another to pray after the meal.
</p>
<p>
    Starting from half an hour before <em>Minchah</em> <em>Ketanah</em>, approximately three hours before sunset, a person must not begin eating even a small
    meal before he recites <em>Minchah</em>. However, if there is someone there to remind him to pray <em>Minchah</em>, he is permitted to eat. In a place in
    which he does not have someone to remind him, it is also possible to set an alarm clock to ring at the time that he must pray <em>Minchah</em>. Yet, he
must be sure that immediately upon hearing the ring, he will stop his meal and go pray (<em>Rama</em> 232:2; <em>Beiâ€™ur Halachah</em> "<em>Vâ€™Yesh</em>";    <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2:12).
</p>
<p>
Once <em>chatzot</em> arrives, some try, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, not to eat even a small meal before reciting <em>Minchah</em>. Therefore, in many<em>yeshivot</em>, <em>Minchah</em> is held early in the afternoon so that after they pray, they can eat lunch according to all opinions.    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Rabbi Yehudahâ€™s Opinion
</h2>
<p>
The prevalent <em>minhag</em> is that of the <em>Chachamim</em>, that <em>Minchah</em> time lasts until the end of the day, and the time to pray    <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> begins after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> (the emerging of the stars) (<em>Berachot</em> 26a). However, according to Rabbi Yehudah, the time
    of <em>Minchah</em> lasts until <em>plag haminchah</em>. "<em>Plag</em>" means half; in other words, the time of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> is divided into
    halves. We already learned (halachah 3) that the time of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> is from nine-and-a-half proportional hours until the end of twelve hours,
    a total of two-and-a-half hours, and if so, one <em>plag</em> is an hour and a quarter. The first <em>plag</em> is the time to pray <em>Minchah</em>, and
    the second <em>plag</em> begins the time of <em>Maâ€™ariv</em>,<em> </em>according to Rabbi Yehudah.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for his opinion is that, in actuality, the <em>Kohanim</em> would rush to slaughter the <em>Tamid</em> and throw its blood upon the altar in the
    first half of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>, and therefore that is the time for <em>Minchah</em>. In the second half they would already start offering the
    organs of the <em>Minchah</em> upon the altar, and since the <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> prayer was instituted to correspond to the sacrifice of the organs, it is
    then that <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> time begins. According to the <em>Chachamim</em>, since it is possible, in principle, to throw the blood of the <em>Tamid</em>
    upon the altar until the end of the day, the time of <em>Minchah</em> also lasts until the end of the day. The time of <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> is coordinated with
    the time to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> of <em>Maâ€™ariv</em>, which begins at<em> tzeit hakochavim</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, this disagreement is left unresolved, and the conclusion of the Talmud (<em>Berachot</em> 27a) is that a person is permitted to decide whether
    he wants to practice like the <em>Chachamim</em> or like Rabbi Yehudah. However, the <em>Rishonim</em> caution that he must make sure that he consistently
    adheres to one <em>minhag</em>. In other words, if he follows Rabbi Yehudah, he must take care not to pray <em>Minchah</em> after <em>plag haminchah</em>.
    If he practices like the <em>Chachamim</em>, he must make sure to always recite <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. However, it is forbidden
    to pray <em>Minchah</em> after <em>plag haminchah</em> like the <em>Chachamim</em>, and <em>Maâ€™ariv</em> before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> like Rabbi
    Yehudah (we shall expand on this law in the laws of <em>Maâ€™ariv</em>, 25:6-7).<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>

            If one mistakenly prayed in the first half-hour after <em>chatzot</em>, the <em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to whether or not he fulfilled his
obligation <em>bâ€™dieved</em>. According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> he did not, whereas according to the <em>Pri Chadash</em> he did. The            <em>Shaâ€™ar HaTzion</em> 233:6 indicates that this matter requires further study, and the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 2 concludes that because prayer is a
            rabbinic obligation, when there is doubt, we are lenient, and he does not repeat his prayer. Further, there is uncertainty with regard to that
            first half-hour, as to whether it is proportional or permanent. The <em>Shaâ€™ar HaTzion</em> 233:8 tends to say that it is proportional.

    <div id="ftn2">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
            This is how the <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>233:1 rules and the <em>Yechaveh Daâ€™at</em> 4:19 expands on this opinion. Another reason to pray close to
            sunset,<em> l'chatchilah</em>, is based on the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Berachot</em> 29b, where Rabbi Yochanan states that it is a mitzvah to pray
            with the last rays of the sun, and <em>Rashi</em> interprets this to mean close to sunset. That is also the opinion of <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em>
            (brought by <em>Hagahot Maymoniyot</em> in chapter 2 of <em>Hilchot Tefillah</em>). Even though the <em>Gemara</em> states that in the West
            (meaning Israel) they would curse a person who prayed with the last rays of the sun, this refers to someone who prayed very late, but slightly
before sunset is the most praiseworthy time. That is how the <em>Arizal</em> practiced. However, the <em>Maharsha</em> interprets that the<em>Gemara</em> is referring to <em>Shacharit</em>, meaning that the mitzvah to pray with the last rays of the sun is at <em>netz</em>. See<em>Yechaveh Daâ€™at</em> 4:19; there he cites a few <em>Rishonim</em> who maintain like <em>Rasag </em>that it is preferable to hasten to pray            <em>Minchah</em> immediately when its time begins.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="ftn3">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
According to <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah<u>,</u></em> the blood of the <em>Tamid</em> was thrown on the altar until sunset, however according to            <em>Rashi</em> it was also permissible to throw the blood of the <em>Tamid</em> at <em>bein hashemashot </em>(twilight). Additionally, even
            according to those who maintain that the throwing of the blood can only be performed until sunset, some say that the <em>Minchah</em> prayer
corresponds to the offering of the organs of the <em>Tamid</em>, its meal offering, and the incense of the afternoon, whose time lasts            <em>bâ€™dieved</em> even through <em>bein hashemashot</em>. So it is written in <em>Hagahot Maymoniyot</em> and <em>Minchat Kohen</em>. Even if it is
            necessary to be stringent concerning the throwing of the blood, for it is a matter of doubt concerning a biblical commandment, still, regarding
prayer, which is a rabbinic obligation, the halachah follows those who are lenient. Furthermore, <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>â€™s opinion maintains that            <em>bein hashemashot</em> only begins at the second sunset, which is 58 and a half minutes after the visible sunset. Therefore, according to him,
            this time is still considered completely day. Although, in practice, we do not follow <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>â€™s opinion, nevertheless, many maintain
            like him and his approach can be added into the equation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="ftn4">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>
            According to the <em>Gra</em>, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 233:14, and <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 9, the time to recite <em>Minchah</em> only lasts
until sunset. However, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, including the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Rama</em> 233:1, and<em>Shaâ€™agat Aryeh</em> 17, it is also permissible to pray at <em>bein hashemashot</em> (twilight). So explains <em>Yechaveh Daâ€™at</em> 5:22; 6:7,            <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 7, 34; and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 233:6.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although from sunset until the emergence of three stars, usually more time passes (some say approximately 18 minutes and some say approximately
25-30 minutes as explained in 25:5), nevertheless, since there are those who maintain that it is forbidden to pray <em>Minchah</em> at<em>bein hashemashot</em>, it is only permissible to be lenient regarding the time that is agreed upon by all the <em>poskim</em> to be            <em>bein hashemashot</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>poskim</em> disagree as to whether it is permissible to begin praying within 13.5 minutes after sunset, when he is certain that his prayer
will end after 13.5 minutes have already passed from sunset. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 110:5 and <em>Eretz Tzvi</em> 121 permit doing so, whereas<em>Magen Avraham</em> 89:4 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 233:5 forbid it. The <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 7, 34 combines the opinions maintaining that            <em>bein hashemashot</em> lasts 18 minutes with the opinion of <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, and on that basis permits starting to pray within 13.5
            minutes. However, he does not permit beginning the <em>Amidah</em> repetition (<em>Chazarat HaShatz)</em> then.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concerning the matter of <em>Vidui</em> and <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, according to the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Ki Tisa </em>8, it is permissible
to recite <em>Vidui</em> within the whole time of <em>bein hashemashot</em>, and the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy until the middle of            <em>bein hashemashot</em> (the time of the calling of the <em>muezzin</em>). However, regarding <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, he writes in paragraph 14
that <em>shev vâ€™al taâ€™aseh</em> (being passive and not actively doing something) is preferable and that one should not perform <em>Nefillat</em>            <em>Apayim</em> during <em>bein hashemashot</em>. So writes the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 131:27 and 51; still, the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> is
            mentioned above.

            According to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 233:14, it is preferable to pray individually before sunset, which is how the prominent rabbis of
Lithuania used to rule. In contrast to them, it is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> that it is preferable to pray in a            <em>minyan</em>, as brought by <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 233:6 and <em>Yechaveh Daâ€™at</em> 5:22. Concerning the matter of <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>,
            the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> clearly maintains that it is not recited, whereas the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 233:9, based on the <em>Ari</em>, writes
that the <em>Amidah</em> repetition must be said even if it will last after sunset, and that is how the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 233:3 and            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 232:6 rule as well.

            See <em>Shabbat</em> 9b, where it is written that it is forbidden to get a haircut, enter a bathhouse or a tannery, eat, or judge a case of law
            close to <em>Minchah </em>time. The <em>Rishonim</em> are divided as to whether or not <em>Chachamim</em> intended to forbid a significant act like
            a long bathing or a large feast, or even a minor act, such as a short bath or a small meal, the reason being that small acts lead to bigger ones,
            like a short meal eventually becoming a long one. Further, they disagree whether the prohibition begins at <em>chatzot</em> (halachic noon) â€" half
an hour before <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>, or starts after nine hours have passed â€" half an hour before <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>. The <em>Rif</em>,<em>Rambam</em>, and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rule stringently concerning performing even a minor act near the time of <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> (            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 232:2). <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em> and the <em>Rosh</em> forbid a significant act near the time of <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> and
            a small act near the time of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> (according to the <em>Gra</em>, this is the main and median opinion). The <em>Maor</em> and
the <em>Rashba</em> maintain that both significant and minor acts are only forbidden near the time of <em>Minchah</em> <em>Ketanah</em>.<em>Rabbeinu Yonah</em> maintains that a minor act is always permissible and a major act is forbidden near <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>. The<em>Hagahot Mordechai</em> and the <em>Mahariv </em>are more lenient and maintain that only a significant act is forbidden from close to            <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>, but a minor act is permissible at all times. (The <em>Rama</em> 232:2 writes that we practice this way. However, it is
proper to be stringent concerning a large feast from <em>chatzot</em>, like the opinion of <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>. Regarding this entire matter, see<em>Rama</em> 232:2, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 232:5 and similarly, paragraphs 21-26, as well as <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 8-16.)            <em>Beiâ€™ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>Labursiki</em>" writes that all activities which will likely last a long time are forbidden, like the ruling
            about going to a tannery.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the <em>Acharonim</em> wonder why nowadays people are not careful concerning these matters. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 15 writes that the
            cause for leniency lies in the <em>Yerushalmi</em>. The main point, it seems, is that living conditions and types of work have changed, and
            therefore it is hard for us to establish the halachah according to the limitations of the activity and the times. Instead, it is necessary to
            return to the basic rule, namely, not to start something that might distract oneâ€™s mind until <em>Minchah</em> time lapses, and the more bothersome
            the activity and the closer it is to the end of <em>Minchah</em> time, the more need there is to be careful. In a place where there is someone who
can remind the people to pray, there is no concern, as the <em>Rama</em> 232:2 says. Even when there is no such person, the            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 232:16 writes that someone who is accustomed to praying in a set <em>minyan</em>, and normally stops in the middle of his
            work or business, may start any activity, for there is no concern that he will forget to pray. Today, we rely on his reasoning.

            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
            232:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 14-16. However, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> in 13 writes that if he began when he was forbidden to do so in the
half-hour before <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>, even if he estimates that he will succeed in praying, he must stop immediately when the time of<em>Minchah Ketanah</em> arrives. Nevertheless, he adds that nowadays we normally are lenient based on the reasons mentioned above (provided by the<em>Rama</em> and <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>). Since it is unclear which activities are prohibited by the <em>Chachamim</em>, and there are            <em>poskim</em> who rule leniently, and in general we are lenient when there is doubt regarding a rabbinic commandment, therefore, I have returned
to the fundamental principle that it all depends on whether or not there is concern that he will forget to recite <em>Minchah</em>. The<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 23 write, "when it is necessary to stop and pray," meaning, when the time of            <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> arrives and not before then, for that is the main time to pray <em>Minchah</em>. However, I did not mention this above
            since, according to the <em>Rama</em> and the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>, when one starts work or a meal at the time of <em>Minchah Gedolah</em>,
            there is no concern that he will forget to pray. On the other hand, if, despite that, there is concern that he will get so involved in what he is
            doing that he will lose track of time, then we should side with those who maintain that if he waits until the time of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> he
            will end up forgetting, and it is better that he prays <em>Minchah</em> immediately. However, when there is no concern that he will forget, such as
when he sets an alarm clock to ring, or asks his friend to remind him to pray at the time of <em>Minchah Ketanah</em>, he must wait until            <em>Minchah Ketanah</em> and then pray.

            This is based on the <em>Rif</em> and the <em>Rambam</em>, as clarified in note 6. Although the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 232:2 rules like them,
still, <em>Sephardim</em> are accustomed to acting leniently, see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 30, <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 232:8. However,<em>l'chatchilah</em> it is good to be stringent and pray before the meal, as explained in <em>Or Lâ€™Tzion</em>, part 2, 15:1-2 and            <em>Yechaveh Daâ€™at</em> 4:19.
        </p>
        <p>
            In extenuating circumstances, it is possible to be lenient and eat a regular meal, even within the three (proportional) hours close to sunset, even
            when he does not have someone to remind him to pray or an alarm clock to set. This is on condition that he regularly prays in a set <em>minyan</em>
            , as maintained by <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 232:16. This is also the opinion of the <em>Mahariv</em>, as brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            232:26.

The <em>poskim</em> disagree as to how the day is defined. According to the <em>Shiltei HaGiborim</em>, <em>Gra</em> and majority of            <em>poskim</em>, it is from <em>netz</em> to sunset, yet the <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> maintains that the day is from <em>amud hashachar</em>
            (dawn) until <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. Based on this, the time of <em>plag haminchah</em> varies. Is it a (proportional) hour and a quarter before
            sunset, or before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>? The <em>minhag</em> is to calculate <em>plag hanminchah</em> from sunset and that is what is written
            in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 233:7 and in the Israeli calendar. However, it can be inferred from the <em>Shaâ€™ar HaTzion</em> that <em>l'chatchilah</em>
            both opinions need to be taken into consideration (233:4; <em>Shaâ€™ar HaTzion</em> 235:14). Still, it is necessary to note that according to the
            approach of the <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> one must calculate <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> like <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, meaning 72 minutes after sunset,
so that <em>chatzot</em> will be in the middle of the day, as explained earlier in this book, chapter 11, note 14. Based on this,            <em>plag haminchah</em> is slightly before the time of the visible sunset (between two and eighteen minutes, fluctuating according to the seasons
            of the year).
