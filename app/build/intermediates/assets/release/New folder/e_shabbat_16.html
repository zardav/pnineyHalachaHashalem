        Chapter 16: Mav’ir and Mekhabeh<em></em>
    </h1>
    <h2>
        1. The <em>Melakha</em> of <em>Hav’ara</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Torah states: "But the seventh day is Shabbat of the Lord your God;
        you shall not do any <em>melakha</em>" (Shemot 20:9). The Sages explain
        that the intent of this verse is to forbid all 39 <em>melakhot</em>
that were instrumental in erecting the <em>Mishkan</em>. One of these        <em>melakhot</em> is <em>Hav’ara </em>(kindling a fire), which was
        necessary to prepare dyes for the <em>Mishkan</em>’s curtains.
Nevertheless, the Torah explicitly mentions the prohibition of        <em>Hav’ara</em>: "You shall kindle no fire throughout your settlements
        on Shabbat" (Shemot 35:3). The Sages ask why it was necessary for the
        Torah to single out <em>Hav’ara</em>. R. Natan explains that the Torah
        was using one <em>melakha</em> to serve as an example, to teach us that
        while all 39 prohibited <em>melakhot</em> are derived from one verse
("You shall not do any <em>melakha</em>"), nevertheless each and every        <em>melakha</em> is an independent prohibition. Therefore, if one
        unknowingly performs multiple <em>melakhot</em>, he must bring a sin
        offering for each one of them (<em>Shabbat</em> 70a).
    </p>
    <p>
        The awesome power of fire allows man to rule over the forces of nature
        and harness them in his service. Through the use of fire, people
        created metal tools, improved food, and later created powerful
        machines. Perhaps this is why <em>Hav’ara</em> was chosen out of all
        the <em>melakhot</em> to express man’s tremendous ability to improve
        the world. However, on Shabbat every Jew must rest and rise above all
        creative activity. We must remember our Creator who took us out of
        Egypt, and we must enjoy Shabbat via Torah study and festive meals.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first glance, there is a basic question about the <em>melakha</em>
        of <em>Hav’ara</em>. We have a ruling: "All destructive acts are exempt
        [by Torah law, but liable rabbinically]" (<em>Shabbat</em> 105b).
        Therefore, if one tore an item of clothing or broke a utensil, he is
        not obligated to bring a sin offering. To be sure, he transgresses
        rabbinically, but not by Torah law. In light of this, and given that
        burning an item generally ruins it, why is lighting a fire on Shabbat
        considered a transgression of a Torah prohibition? The answer is that
        any time the positive elements provided by the fire (heating or
        lighting one’s home) outweigh the loss of the burned item, it is
        classified as a constructive rather than a destructive act (MT 12:1;
        see <em>Kesef Mishneh</em>).
    </p>
    <h2>
        2. The Laws of <em>Hav’ara</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        One who lights a fire of any size that meets some need violates a Torah
        prohibition. It makes no difference whether he starts the fire by
        rubbing stones together, using a magnifying glass to focus the sun’s
        rays on straw, lighting a match, or turning on the electricity. It also
        does not matter if the fire is fueled by oil, kerosene, or electricity.
        Anytime one intends to start a fire and succeeds in doing so, he
        transgresses a Torah prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, one who merely causes sparks to be released does not violate
        Torah law. Furthermore, if the sparks were released unintentionally,
        there is no prohibition at all. Therefore, one may wear woolen or
        synthetic clothes, even though sometimes sparks are released when
        putting them on or taking them off. Since these sparks are released
unintentionally and to no purpose, there is no prohibition (SSK 15:76;        <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:46).
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as it is prohibited by Torah law to kindle a new fire, it is also
        prohibited by Torah law to increase a pre-existing flame. The law on
        Yom Tov is different; while one may not kindle a new fire then either,
        one may turn up an existing flame. On Shabbat, however, one may not
        even raise a flame. For example, one may not increase the flame on a
        gas burner by turning the knob controlling the gas flow. Likewise, one
        may not increase the flow of kerosene to a heater in order to raise the
        flame or add oil to a burning lamp on Shabbat (<em>Beitza</em> 22a).
    </p>
    <p>
Similarly, one may not stoke coals, since this intensifies the fire (        <em>Kereitot</em> 20a). Likewise, one may not open the door of a
        wood-fired oven because doing so allows air to enter the oven and fan
        the embers, thus increasing the fire (MB<strong> </strong>259:21). If
        the oven door is already open, or there is a fire in an enclosed area
        (such as a fireplace), one may not open a window or door facing the
        fire, because a strong wind may enter and fan the flames. If there is
        no breeze, one may open the door or window (SA 277:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        While an oil lamp is on a table, one must try to avoid shaking the
        table, because the oil may move closer to the wick and increase the
        flame, a violation of <em>Hav’ara</em>. However, if it is a wax candle
        on the table, or if the oil lamp has a floating wick, he does not need
        to worry that shaking the table will cause the flame to increase (MB
        277:18).
    </p>
    <h2>
        3. Reading by Candlelight
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages ordained that one may not read by the light of an oil lamp on
        Shabbat, lest the flame become dim and the reader absent-mindedly tip
        the lamp so that more oil reaches the wick, thus transgressing the
        Torah prohibition of <em>Hav’ara</em>. To be sure, the Sages also
        ordained the kindling of Shabbat lamps, but this serves a different
        purpose. Shabbat candles are meant to provide light for the meal, not
        for careful examination of texts, and to allow one to walk around in
        his home without bumping into furniture. In contrast, the Sages forbade
        doing things that require careful examination by lamplight, out of
        concern that in such a case one might end up tipping the lamp in order
        to see better. One who wishes to study by the light of an oil lamp
        should ask a friend to keep him company, to ensure that he will not
        tilt it. Alternatively, he may learn together with a friend so that
        they can look out for each other (<em>Shabbat</em> 11a; SA 275:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
        Many <em>poskim</em> maintain that a lone individual may read by the
        light of a wax or paraffin candle because there is no concern that he
        will tilt the candle. Unlike an oil lamp, where the point of tilting is
        to move oil up the wick to the flame, the wax in a candle is attached
        to the wick and already close to the flame, so tilting would serve no
        purpose. Similarly, there is no concern that one might come to adjust
        the wick, since candles burn well on their own, and there is no need to
        adjust them at all once they are lit (MB 275:4; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>
        275:11).
    </p>
    <p>
        An individual may study by the light of an electric lamp, even if only
        one of two bulbs in the lamp is turned on, and even when the intensity
        of the light can be adjusted by means of a dimmer; the ordinance
        regarding oil lamps was because of concern that if the light grew dim,
        one might tilt the lamp to restore the light. There was no concern that
        one might light an additional lamp or add oil to an existing one. Since
        electric lights do not grow dim, we are not concerned that one might
turn on an additional light or turn up an existing one. Nevertheless,        <em> le-khatĥila</em> it is advisable to cover the dimmer knob with a
        note that says "Shabbat" so that no one will accidentally adjust the
        light (SSK 13:37; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 6:20).
    </p>
    <h2>
        4. Shabbat Candles
    </h2>
    <p>
        While a candle is burning at home, one must be careful not to open a
        window or door facing it, as the wind may blow out the flame. Even if
        the wind outside is currently too weak to put out a candle, one still
        may not open a window, since it might happen that at the very moment
        when the window is opened, the wind will become stronger and blow out
        the candle. If this happens, it would mean that the act of opening the
        window blew out the candle. When there is no wind whatsoever, some
        permit opening the window, while others forbid it. In a case of
        necessity, such as when it is hot inside the room, one may follow the
        lenient position, and the window may be opened (MB 277:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may open a window or door if even a strong wind would be unable to
        extinguish the candle; for example, if the candle is at a great
        distance from the window or door, or if the window is at such an angle
        that very little wind comes through it. Even if the wind is likely to
        affect the flame and cause it to flicker, as long as it is not powerful
enough to blow it out, one may open the door or window (SA 277:1;        <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:26 n. 6).
    </p>
    <p>
        If Shabbat candles were lit in front of an open window and then the
        wind started blowing, the window may be closed in order to protect the
        flame. By closing the window, one is not acting directly on the flame
        itself; one is merely preventing the wind from blowing it out (Rema
        277:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one may close a door in a place where a fire is burning
        (such as a room with a fireplace), even if the wind coming in is
        blowing on the coals and fanning the flame, and closing the door will
        weaken the fire. Closing the door is not considered an act of
        extinguishing, since it merely prevents more wind from entering and
        feeding the flame (SA 277:2). In contrast, if the fire is fueled by gas
        or kerosene, one may not turn down the flow of the fuel. This truly
        qualifies as extinguishing, since one is acting directly on the fuel
        itself (SA 265:1).

    <h2>
5. The <em>Melakha</em> of <em>Mekhabeh</em> and the Meaning of        <em>Melakha She-eina Tzerikha Le-gufah</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
Extinguishing a fire in order to produce charcoal is one of the 39        <em>melakhot</em> prohibited on Shabbat. In the <em>Mishkan</em> they
        would turn wood into charcoal by setting fire to wood and then
        extinguishing it. They would then use this charcoal to build a steady
        and long-lasting fire for preparing the dyes used to color the curtains
        in the <em>Mishkan</em>. Similarly, if one extinguishes the flame of a
        candle so that its wick will light more easily later on, he
        transgresses a Torah prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        What about one who extinguishes a fire not because he wants the
        charcoal, but because he wants to conserve fuel, or because the light
        produced by the flame is bothering him? In other words, he is not
        essentially interested in putting out the fire; he simply does not want
        the candle to keep burning. The Tanna’im disagree about this. According
to R. Shimon, since this is a        <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> (a <em>melakha </em>that is
        not needed for its own sake) it is only prohibited rabbinically.
        However, according to R. Yehuda, even if one’s objective is not the
        performance of the <em>melakha</em><em> </em>itself, since he does in
fact intend to extinguish the flame, he has performed a        <em>melakha</em> and violated Torah law (<em>Shabbat</em> 31b and 93b).
    </p>
    <p>
Practically speaking, Rambam maintains that a        <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> is prohibited by Torah law
        (MT 1:7), while according to most Rishonim it is rabbinically
        prohibited (R. Hai Gaon, Rabbeinu Ĥananel, <em>Ha-ma’or</em>, Ramban,
        and others; see also SA 334:27 and MB <em>ad loc.</em> 85). Since the
        only difference between a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>
and a regular <em>melakha</em> is the intention behind it, performing a        <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> is considered more severe
        than violating a standard rabbinic prohibition. (See above 9:6.)
    </p>
    <h2>
        6. Fire that Causes Property Damage
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a fire breaks out on Shabbat, the first question that must be
        addressed is whether it presents a danger to human life. If it does,
        there is a mitzva to do whatever is necessary to extinguish it.
        However, if it is clear that there is no danger to human life, then
        even if the fire may cause extensive property damage, as is the case
        when an entire house goes up in flames, one may not put it out, because
        monetary loss does not override Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the Sages prohibited moving items from a burning house to
        the street or courtyard even when there is an <em>eruv</em>. Their
        concern was that people might be so panicked about saving their
        property that they may either put out the fire or carry objects from a
private domain to a public domain, thereby violating the        <em>melakha </em>of <em>Hotza’ah</em>. Only food, clothing, and
        receptacles/implements needed for that Shabbat may be removed from a
        burning home (assuming it is within the <em>eruv</em>). If there is a
        large receptacle in the home, one may fill it with food even if it is
        more than will be needed for that Shabbat, as long as it can be carried
        out of the home in one trip. The same principle applies to clothing: as
        long as one is wearing them as he leaves the house, he may save many
        items of clothing, even more than are necessary for that Shabbat. This
        prohibition only applies to moving things into a shared courtyard; but
        one may salvage any quantity of food and non-<em>muktzeh </em>objects
        into a private yard where an <em>eruv</em> is not required, or into
        another apartment in the same building where there is an <em>eruv</em>
        (SA 334:11, MB <em>ad loc</em>. 28).
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn2"

        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as a homeowner may save items that he needs for Shabbat, he may
        also tell his neighbors that they can take whatever they need. Each
        neighbor can then take food for himself for Shabbat and put on as many
        items of clothing as he can. After Shabbat, the custom of the pious is
        to return the salvaged clothing and items to the original owner (SA
        334:9; SSK 41:3-13).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether one may salvage money and
        valuables that are not necessary for Shabbat from a burning building.
        One who is lenient has an opinion on which to rely. However, this is
        all on condition that he not transgress a Torah prohibition. If, in
        order to salvage his money, he would need to carry it from a private
        domain to a public domain, thus violating Torah law, he may not do so.
        However, he may carry the money out with a <em>shinui</em>, as this is
only rabbinically prohibited (SA 334:2; <em>Taz</em>; see MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 4-5, SHT <em>ad loc</em>. 3, and BHL s.v. "ve-yesh").
    </p>
    <p>
        Residents of neighboring buildings may remove everything they own from
        their homes. As long as the fire has not yet spread to their homes, we
        can assume that they are not so panicked, and so we are not worried
        that they will end up putting out the fire (SA 334:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Although a Jew may not extinguish the fire, he may hint to a non-Jew to
        do so. For example, he may say: "Whoever extinguishes this fire will
        not lose out." Or he could call to the non-Jew urgently and tell him
        that a fire has broken out and that it is forbidden for a Jew to put it
        out. The non-Jew will then figure out on his own that the Jew wants him
        to put out the fire, and perhaps will even pay him for doing so (SA
        334:26).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one may indirectly cause the fire to go out, since according
        to Torah law it is only acting directly that is forbidden. Normally the
        Sages forbid causing <em>melakha</em> to be done indirectly, but in a
        case of loss, <em>grama </em>is permitted. Therefore, if one side of a
        cabinet catches fire, one may cover the other side with wet rags so
        that the fire will go out when it reaches them. Similarly, one may
        place bags full of water on a spot where the fire has not yet reached,
        so that they will burst open and extinguish the fire when it reaches
        them (SA 334:22). One may also pour water on a spot that is not
        burning, as long as it is far enough away from the fire that the water
        will only reach the fire and begin extinguishing it after a while (See
        SA 334:24; SSK 41:16).
    </p>
    <h2>
        7. Putting Out a Fire When There Is Danger to Human Life
    </h2>
    <p>
        In a situation where human life might be endangered by a fire, it is a
        mitzva for anyone who can put it out to do so as soon as possible,
        since danger to human life overrides Shabbat. Even if the danger is
        uncertain, it is still a mitzva to put out the fire. For example, if a
        fire breaks out in a large building, even if it seems that all the
        residents managed to get out, one must put out the fire as long as
        there is a possibility that someone may still be inside. Even if the
        odds are that anyone left inside has already died, since there is still
        a chance that a rescue is possible, everything must be done to put out
        the fire (SA 329:3; below 27:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything necessary must be done as efficiently as possible on all
        fronts: Those able to rescue people from the fire should try to do so,
        and those able to extinguish or control the fire should try to do so
        with whatever means are at their disposal. At the same time, others
        should call the fire department. If an observer is uncertain whether
        the fire department has been called already, even if it seems likely
        that they have been, he too must call to make sure that they come,
        because the possibility of saving lives overrides Shabbat. At such a
        time one must not ask a rabbi what to do, but rather move as quickly as
        possible to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, nowadays we treat any large fire that breaks out in a
        residential building as a life-threatening one that must be
        extinguished even on Shabbat. For example, if a fire breaks out in an
        apartment building, there is a concern that it may spread to additional
        apartments and there may not be time to evacuate the residents.
        Besides, when there is a large fire there is no time to check if there
        are apartments with babies or disabled people who cannot make their way
        out on their own. Additionally, some homes contain explosive gas
        canisters that endanger people outside the building, especially
        considering that fires often attract large numbers of gawkers.
        Sometimes it takes longer to clear people out of the area than to put
        out the fire. If the fire is near other homes, it might spread and
        endanger those residents. Sometimes a fire breaks out in a storage area
        containing chemicals whose poisonous fumes may endanger area residents.
    </p>
    <p>
        R. Shlomo Goren ruled that if anti-Israel terrorists start a fire that
        will damage property, it may be extinguished on Shabbat even if there
        is no danger to life, because if we do not put it out, the terrorists
        will feel they have succeeded and will be motivated to undertake
        similar attacks that could endanger lives (this is based on SA 329:6
        and R. Goren’s expansion of the category of a "border town," which may
        be defended against even property damage on Shabbat, to all cities in
        Israel, where low-grade conflict can break out; see below 27:12).
    </p>
    <h2>
        8. Putting Out a Fire to Prevent People from Being Injured
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen (section 5), one who puts out a fire only transgresses
        rabbinically, according to most <em>poskim</em>. Only one who
extinguishes a fire in order to produce charcoal is doing so        <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em>. When one puts out a fire in order to prevent
        damage from occurring, he is not interested in the act of
        extinguishing, but in creating a situation in which the fire is gone.
Accordingly, this is considered a        <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, even though the Sages insisted that one may not put out a
        fire in order to salvage property, they permitted extinguishing a fire
        that has the potential to cause mass injury. For example, if there is a
        burning ember in a public domain, where many people are liable to be
        harmed by it, one may remove it even though it is <em>muktzeh</em>. If
        it is impossible to move it, the Sages permitted extinguishing it in
        order to prevent harm to the public, even though there is no danger to
        human life. However, in Israel, one may not call the fire department,
        because their travel involves Torah prohibitions, and one may not
        violate Torah law in order to prevent possible harm that does not
        involve potential loss of life. In the Diaspora, where firefighters are
        non-Jews, one may call the fire department, as this only involves the
        violation of a rabbinic prohibition (SA 334:27; see below 27:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        To summarize, we have discussed three situations in which one may put
        out a fire directly or indirectly:
    </p>
    <p>
        1) In a situation of danger to human life, it is a mitzva to do
        everything possible to save lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        2) In a situation where there is a danger of harm to the public, one
        may put out the fire (as the Sages did not apply rabbinic rules in such
        a case), but one still may not violate Torah prohibitions to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        3) In a situation where there is financial loss but no threat of
        physical harm to humans, one may not extinguish the fire. Nevertheless,
        one may do so via <em>grama</em>. One may also hint to a non-Jew to put
        out the fire.

            <em>Beitza</em>
22a states: "One who adds oil to a lamp is liable on account of            <em>Mav’ir</em>, and one who takes some away is liable on account
            of <em>Mekhabeh</em>." According to <em>Tosafot</em>, the reason
            one is liable for removing oil is that when he does this, the flame
            is immediately weakened. In contrast, if adding or removing oil has
an effect only after a while, this is considered <em>grama</em>;            <em> </em>one is not extinguishing a flame but only causing a flame
to be extinguished indirectly. However, according to Rosh (            <em>Beitza</em> 2:17), even if adding or removing oil does not have
            an immediate impact, since ultimately it will cause the lamp to
stay lit for a longer or shorter amount of time, it is considered<em>Mav’ir</em> and <em>Mekhabeh</em> by Torah law. In his opinion,            <em>grama</em> only applies in a case where the action is not done
            directly to the item in question. An example of this would be
            filling pitchers with water that will burst when a fire reaches
            them, thereby releasing the water and extinguishing the fire.
            However, in our case, one is acting on the fuel itself, directly
            changing the amount of time the fire will stay lit. It follows that
            if one adds kerosene to an oven or oil to a lamp, and the strength
            of the fire immediately increases, all agree that he has
            transgressed a Torah prohibition. However, if the fire does not
            show the effect of his actions immediately, but will ultimately
            stay lit for longer, according to Rosh this is prohibited by Torah
            law, whereas according to <em>Tosafot</em> the prohibition is
            rabbinic.

            According to Rambam and those who follow his approach, who maintain
            that performing a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> is
            prohibited by Torah law, it is clear that there is no way to permit
            putting out a fire to save one’s possessions. It is also obvious
            why the Sages ordained that one may not save more than what is
            necessary for Shabbat. However, according to most <em>poskim</em>,
            who maintain that a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> is
            only rabbinically prohibited, why does this rabbinic prohibition
            apply even in a case where following it would lead to a massive
            loss? After all, the Sages permitted stamping on the grass clogging
            up a pipe in order to prevent a loss (<em>Ketubot</em> 60a; SA
            336:9). Even though many maintain that fixing the pipe would be
prohibited by Torah law, the Sages permitted fixing it with a            <em>shinui</em> to prevent a loss (<em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §103).
            Similarly, they were lenient in allowing one to carry valuable
            possessions into a public thoroughfare with a <em>shinui</em> to
prevent their possible theft (Rema 301:33). Some even permit moving            <em>muktzeh</em> objects in order to save possessions from fire or
            theft (SA 334:2). So why didn’t the Sages allow one to put out a
            fire in order to save all of his possessions?
        </p>
        <p>
            It would seem that the answer is that, as Ran writes (on Rif, 61a,
            s.v. "u-vimkom"), a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> is
            more severe than other rabbinic prohibitions. Ran suggests that
            since performing a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>
            looks the same as performing an act prohibited by Torah law, and
            only the intent differs, the Sages were concerned that people would
            be unable to distinguish between the two and would end up being
            lenient even with Torah prohibitions. Therefore, the Sages forbade
putting out a fire even in the case of a            <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>. A similar approach
            appears in <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 46:1 and BHL §278 at the end of s.v.
"mutar." (A parallel idea appears in the laws of            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, as explained in MB 342:1.) It also may
            be that because having a fire in one’s home can make one extremely
            distressed, one who is worried about his possessions might perform
            several <em>melakhot</em> in his distressed state. Because of this,
the Sages felt a need to reinforce the observance of the            <em>melakhot</em> and did not permit even rabbinic transgressions.
            They allowed rescuing possessions only under very limited
            circumstances, so as to eliminate the concern that it would cause
            people to transgress other prohibitions as well.

            R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, cited in SSK ch. 41 n. 8, wonders why we
            do not seem to be concerned about the emotional state of the
            homeowner and his family, who might lose their minds upon seeing
            their home and possessions going up in flames. In fact, it is
            possible for one to die or to go insane as a result of this kind of
            trauma. Elsewhere in SSK (ch. 32 n. 83), R. Auerbach points out
            that some allow the transgression of Torah prohibitions to protect
            one’s mental and emotional health. In practice it would seem that
            when there is a real possibility of a family member experiencing
            psychological trauma, the fire may be extinguished, but when there
            is no such concern, even if tremendous suffering is involved, one
            may not extinguish the fire.
