        1. The Basic Principles of <em>Havdala</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a mitzva to conclude Shabbat with <em>havdala</em>, in which we
        give verbal expression to the difference between the sanctity of
Shabbat and the ordinary weekdays. The laws pertaining to        <em>havdala</em> are similar to those pertaining to <em>kiddush</em>.
        Just as one must mention the sanctity of Shabbat on Friday night both
        during prayer and over a cup of wine, so too, at the conclusion of
        Shabbat one must recite <em>havdala</em> both during prayer and over a
        cup of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is true that originally, when the Men of the Great Assembly
        formulated <em>havdala</em>, they designed it for prayer alone. This
        was because it was at the time of the building of the Second Temple,
        and the Jews were poor. Therefore, the Sages did not wish to burden
        them with an additional expense by requiring wine for <em>havdala</em>.
        However, later on when the Jews’ financial situation improved and they
        could afford it, the Sages ordained that <em>havdala</em> be recited
over a cup of wine. There was a period of time when people made        <em>havdala</em> only on a cup of wine, not during prayer. Eventually
        it was decided that <em>havdala</em> would be done both during prayer
and over a cup of wine. Women, who do not generally pray        <em>Ma’ariv</em>, fulfill their obligation by hearing <em>havdala</em>
over a cup of wine. Similarly, if one forgot to add the        <em>havdala</em> insertion in the<em> Amida</em>, he does not repeat
the prayer. Rather, he fulfills the obligation by hearing        <em>havdala</em> over a cup of wine (SA 294:1).
    </p>
    <p>
The <em>havdala</em> in prayer is recited during the fourth<em>berakha</em> of the<em> Amida</em> since this is the first        <em>berakha</em> that relates to everyday matters. Additionally, the
        theme of this <em>berakha</em> is knowledge, without which one cannot
        distinguish between the sacred and the profane. Therefore, it is
        logical to integrate <em>havdala</em> into the <em>berakha</em> in
        which we request wisdom and knowledge (<em>Berakhot</em> 33a).
    </p>
    <p>
        According to many <em>poskim</em>, the obligation of <em>havdala</em>
is by Torah law. These <em>poskim </em>understand the mitzva of        <em>Zakhor</em> to include both <em>kiddush </em>and <em>havdala</em>;
        that is, marking Shabbat’s onset by invoking its sanctity and its exit
        by distinguishing the sacred from the profane. The requirement to
        recite <em>kiddush </em>and <em>havdala </em>over a cup of wine is
rabbinic (Rambam). Others maintain that the Torah commandment of        <em>Zakhor </em>is limited to invoking the sanctity of Shabbat at its
onset, but the Sages expanded the mitzva by ordaining the recitation of        <em>havdala </em>at its end (Rosh).
    </p>
    <p>
        Women are obligated in <em>havdala </em>like men. Even though it is a
        time-dependent positive mitzva, from which women are generally exempt,
        since it is linked to the mitzva of <em>kiddush</em>, women are
obligated to recite <em>havdala </em>just as they are obligated in        <em>kiddush</em> (as explained above in 6:1). Nevertheless, there is an
        opinion that since <em>havdala</em> is time-dependent, women are exempt
from it (<em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em>). In deference to this,        <em>le-khatĥila</em> women generally do not make <em>havdala</em> for
        themselves, but rather hear it from a man. However, if there is no man
        present, a woman must make <em>havdala</em> for herself, reciting all
        four <em>berakhot </em>of <em>havdala</em>. Even if there is a man
        present, if he has already fulfilled his <em>havdala</em> obligation,
        it is proper that the woman make <em>havdala</em> for herself (MB
        296:36). Only if she does not know how to make the <em>berakhot</em>
herself can a man who already fulfilled his obligation make        <em>havdala</em> for her.

        2. <em>Havdala</em> over Wine
    </h2>
    <p>
        The procedure for making <em>havdala</em> over wine is as follows. It
        is customary to begin with a series of verses from the Prophets and
        Writings to serve as good omens and start the week off on a positive
        note. This is followed by four <em>berakhot</em> - <em>Ha-gafen</em>
        over the wine, "<em>besamim</em>"<em> </em>over the fragrance (see
        below), "<em>borei me’orei ha-esh</em>" ("Creator of firelight") over
        fire, and finally "<em>ha-mavdil bein kodesh le-ĥol</em>"<em> </em>
        ("Who distinguishes sacred from profane").
    </p>
    <p>
Two of these <em>berakhot</em>, <em>Ha-gafen</em> and        <em>Ha-mavdil</em>, are essential; one who has not recited them has not
        fulfilled the mitzva of making <em>havdala</em> over wine.
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
        The Sages ordained that two additional <em>berakhot </em>are recited:
        one on a pleasant aroma, and one over fire. The former helps to soothe
        the soul’s pain upon the departure of the <em>neshama yeteira</em> at
        the end of Shabbat. The latter was instituted to commemorate the end of
        the first Shabbat, when God gave Adam the insight to rub two stones
        together and make a fire. One who does not have a fragrance or candle
        may make <em>havdala</em> without them. If, later on that night, a
        fragrance becomes available, he should recite the <em>berakha</em> and
        smell it. If he sees a candle or fire, he should recite <em>ha-esh</em>
. Ideally, of course, one should prepare a fragrance and a candle for        <em>havdala</em> so that all four <em>berakhot</em> can be recited in
        the order instituted by the Sages (SA 297:1; 298:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>berakhot </em>proceed from the most physical to the most
        sublime of the senses. First we recite the <em>berakha</em> over wine.
        Taste is an extremely physical sense, activated only when food actually
        touches the mouth. Next we advance to the sense of smell, which
        requires proximity but not physical contact. The next <em>berakha</em>
        is over light. The sense of sight is even more subtle, as one can
perceive something even at a great distance. Finally, the        <em>berakha </em>of <em>Ha-mavdil</em> pertains to the ability to
        discern, a function of intelligence. The apex of this ability is
discernment between the sacred and the profane (Rashbatz quoted in        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 296:3).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Customs Related to <em>Havdala</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Since the Sages ordained that <em>havdala</em> be recited over wine,
        the cup should be held during <em>havdala</em>. It is held in the right
        hand, as it is the more important one. This preference for the right
        hand is true for all <em>berakhot</em>: Whenever a <em>berakha</em> is
        made over something, the object should be held in the right hand.
        Accordingly, when making the <em>berakha</em> over fragrance, the
        person making <em>havdala</em> should hold the fragrance in his right
        hand. During that time, many rest the cup of wine on a plate. Later,
        when they reach the <em>berakha </em>of <em>Ha-mavdil</em>, they pick
        up the cup once again. Some beautify the mitzva by holding the cup even
        while making the <em>berakhot</em> on the fragrance and the candle.
        Since the right hand has to be free to pick up the fragrance and to
        look at the candle’s flame, they pick up the cup in their left hand.
        When they reach <em>Ha-mavdil</em> they return the cup to their right
        hand (SA 296:6; MB <em>ad loc</em>.).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some have the custom to sit for <em>havdala</em>, since by sitting the
        listeners establish that they wish to fulfill their obligation with
        this recitation of <em>havdala</em> (SA 296:6). Others customarily
        stand, demonstrating respect for Shabbat as it departs (Rema). In that
        case, in order to make it clear that everyone intends to fulfill their
        obligation by listening to <em>havdala</em>, they must gather round the
        person making <em>havdala</em>. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if one stood at a
        distance but listened intently to the <em>havdala</em>, he has
        fulfilled his obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
        As is the case with any <em>kos</em> <em>shel</em> <em>berakha</em> (a
        cup of wine linked to the performance of a mitzva), one should ensure
        that the cup is clean both inside and out. Many make a point of using a
        fancy goblet for <em>havdala</em>. The cup must hold a <em>revi’it</em>
        (roughly 75 ml and 150 ml according to <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>; see 6:5
        above). If the cup has a larger capacity, it is a mitzva to fill it
        with wine, since it is appropriate to honor the <em>berakha</em> with a
full cup. Although in most cases of <em>kos</em> <em>shel</em>        <em>berakha</em> (e.g., for <em>kiddush</em> or at a wedding) it is
        preferable not to fill the cup all the way to the point of spilling
        over, many have the custom to fill the <em>havdala</em> cup to the
        point that it overflows a bit, as this is a symbol of blessing (Rema
296:1, and see 6:6 above for the rest of the laws concerning a        <em>kos shel berakha</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
Ideally, the person making <em>havdala</em> should drink the entire<em>revi’it</em> of wine in the cup so that he can recite a        <em>berakha aĥarona</em> over the wine. Nevertheless, to fulfill the
mitzva of <em>havdala</em> it is sufficient to drink a        <em>melo lugmav</em> (see above, 6:5, and n. 6 <em>ad loc. </em>
regarding a case where one did not drink a cheek full; also see        <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Berakhot</em> 10:10).
    </p>
    <p>
The audience must remain silent until the person making        <em>havdala</em> finishes drinking a <em>melo lugmav</em>; since it is
        a mitzva to make <em>havdala</em> over a cup of wine, <em>havdala</em>
is completed only when the person making <em>havdala</em> drinks a        <em>melo lugmav</em>. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if a listener speaks before
        the person making <em>havdala </em>drank from the cup, he has still
        fulfilled his obligation (SSK 60:39 and 48:6; see above, ch. 6 n. 10).
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Using Beverages Other Than Wine
    </h2>
    <p>
        Ideally one should make <em>havdala</em> over wine, which is the most
        dignified beverage, as it nourishes and gladdens, so when it is enjoyed
        in the service of a mitzva, it has the unique capability to reveal the
inner goodness of the Jewish people. The Sages state that one who makes        <em>havdala</em> over wine on Saturday night will be blessed with
        children (<em>Shev.</em> 18b).
    </p>
    <p>
However, if there is no wine available, one may use        <em>ĥamar medina</em> (lit. "the wine of the country"), a dignified
        beverage that people in that locale drink as one would drink wine (SA
        296:2). For example, in many places people commonly drink beer. In such
places, since beer is important for them, they may make<em>havdala</em> over it, replacing <em>Ha-gafen </em>with        <em>She-hakol</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one has wine but prefers <em>ĥamar medina</em>, some say that he may
        not make <em>havdala</em> on <em>ĥamar medina</em> (Rabbeinu Ĥananel;
Rashbam), while others maintain one may nevertheless use        <em>ĥamar medina</em> (Rambam; <em>Smag</em>). In practice, it is
        proper for even one who prefers beer to recite <em>havdala </em>over
        wine, as long as he also likes wine. However, if he wants to, he may
        make <em>havdala</em> on <em>ĥamar medina</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vodka and arak are also considered <em>ĥamar medina</em>, but because
        they are so strong it is difficult to drink a <em>melo lugmav </em>(c.
        50-55 ml) of them. One who is able to drink a <em>melo lugmav </em>of
        them may recite <em>havdala </em>over them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether a beverage must be alcoholic
        to be considered <em>ĥamar medina</em>. The lenient <em>poskim</em>
        maintain that any beverage that one would serve to important guests,
        and which people sometimes sit around drinking with friends, is
        considered a dignified beverage and may be used for <em>havdala</em>.
        Thus, one may make <em>havdala </em>on coffee, tea, or malt beer, as
        well as fresh-squeezed apple juice or orange juice. However, one should
        not make <em>havdala</em> over flavored beverages or other soft drinks,
        like grapefruit juice or Coca Cola, because they are not dignified
        beverages, merely drinks that quench one’s thirst. Some rule leniently
        even regarding these beverages, since one would serve them to important
        guests.
    </p>
    <p>
        The stringent <em>poskim </em>maintain that only alcoholic beverages
        are considered <em>ĥamar medina</em>, because these are the beverages
        that people drink at collegial parties. Other drinks, however, are not
        so dignified and should not be used for <em>havdala</em>. According to
        this, one may make <em>havdala</em> on beer and other alcoholic
        beverages, but not on coffee, malt beer, or fruit juice.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, one should be stringent and make <em>havdala</em> over
alcoholic beverages only. Only if these are unavailable, then        <em>be-di’avad</em> one may make <em>havdala</em> on dignified
        non-alcoholic beverages.

    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. <em>Besamim</em> (Fragrance)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages enacted the recitation of a <em>berakha</em> on smelling
        fragrance on Saturday night, because after Shabbat our spirits are
        despondent over the departure of the <em>neshama yeteira</em>. In order
        to revive them, we smell fragrance, which, according to the Sages,
        brings joy to the soul. Even one who does not feel pain at the
        departure of Shabbat will come to appreciate Shabbat’s greatness and
        realize that he should feel sorrow at its end, and that he should
        revive his soul with something aromatic.<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        One makes a <em>berakha</em> over fragrance following Shabbat, but not
following Yom Tov, because on Yom Tov we are not granted a        <em>neshama yeteira</em>. Additionally, when Yom Tov begins on Saturday
        night, one does not make the <em>berakha</em> over fragrance, because
        the joy of Yom Tov and its foods serve to comfort the soul (SA 491:1
        and MB).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one does not make the <em>berakha</em> over fragrance after
Yom Kippur. Since we fast on Yom Kippur, there is no        <em>neshama yeteira</em>, and there is not much sorrow at the
        conclusion of Yom Kippur (SA 624:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        All those listening to <em>havdala</em> must smell the fragrance;
        therefore the person reciting <em>havdala</em> should wait until all
        listeners have smelled the fragrance, and only afterward continue with
        the <em>berakha</em> over fire. If the person making <em>havdala</em>
        continues to the next <em>berakha</em> before some listeners have a
chance to smell the fragrance, they should listen to the next        <em>berakhot</em>, and smell the fragrance afterward. One unable to
        smell does not make the <em>berakha</em> over the fragrance (SA 297:5;
        MB 13; SSK 61:8).
    </p>
    <p>
As people are generally aware, the Sages instituted different        <em>berakhot</em> for different types of fragrance. If the fragrance
comes from a tree or shrub, the <em>berakha</em> is "        <em>borei atzei vesamim</em>" ("Who creates fragrant trees"). If it
        comes from an herb, one recites "<em>borei isvei vesamim</em>" ("Who
        creates fragrant herbs"). If the fragrance is from a fruit, one recites
        "<em>ha-noten rei’aĥ tov ba-peirot</em>" ("Who gives fruit a good
        scent"). If the source of the fragrance is inorganic or from an animal,
        one recites "<em>borei minei vesamim</em>" ("Who creates types of
        fragrance"). However, when it comes to <em>havdala</em>, the Ashkenazic
        custom is to always say "<em>borei minei vesamim</em>," since most
        people are not experts on different types of fragrances and their
respective <em>berakhot</em>, and if one mistakenly recites "<em>borei isvei vesamim</em>"<em> </em>over something from a tree, or "        <em>borei atzei vesamim</em>" over an herb, he has not fulfilled his
obligation. Therefore, the custom is to recite "        <em>borei minei vesamim</em>" because, <em>be-di’avad</em>, it covers
all fragrances. The Sephardic custom, in contrast, is to recite the        <em>berakha</em> appropriate for the specific type of fragrance. For
example, when using myrtle or rosemary, one recites "        <em>borei atzei vesamim</em>" (MB 216:39; 297:1; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>
        297:31; <em>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</em> 14:1, 5).
    </p>
    <p>
        A <em>berakha </em>is recited over fragrances whose purpose is to give
        off a pleasing scent. However, no <em>berakha</em> is recited over
        fragrances whose purpose is to get rid of a bad smell, such as restroom
        air fresheners or deodorants (<em>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</em> 14:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding synthetic fragrances, some say that no <em>berakha</em> is
        recited, because the substance does not naturally smell good; the
        pleasing aroma is created by an artificial process. In practice, it
seems proper that one who wishes to recite "        <em>borei minei vesamim</em>" over it may do so, since ultimately the
        chemical properties that enabled the manufacture of this pleasing scent
were created by God and it thus warrants a <em>berakha</em> (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</em> 14:2-3 and n. 3).
    </p>
    <p>
Some enhance the smelling of <em>besamim </em>by using the        <em>etrog </em>that they used on Sukkot; since it was used for a
mitzva, it is fitting to make a <em>berakha </em>on it at        <em>havdala</em>. Cloves are stuck into the <em>etrog </em>to enhance
        its smell and preserve it (based on Rema 297:4). Since the resulting
        scent is the product of two types of fragrance (fruit and tree),
        according to all customs one recites "<em>borei minei vesamim</em>"
        over it (MB 216:39).
    </p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. The Candle
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages instituted making a <em>berakha</em> over a candle on
        Saturday night, to commemorate God’s granting Adam the insight to
        strike two stones together to produce fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ideally, one makes the <em>berakha</em> over an <em>avuka</em> (lit.,
        "torch"), that is, a braided candle that has at least two wicks. Since
        its flame has two sources, its light is great. If one does not have a
        braided candle, he may light two matches, which can also be considered
        an <em>avuka</em>. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if there is no alternative, one
        may recite the <em>berakha</em> over a candle with only one wick (SA
        298:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        The candle must be bright enough that even without an electric light,
        one could use it to distinguish between different coins. The custom is
        to ensure this by looking at the lines in one’s palm and at the base of
        the fingernails; this is considered a good omen (SA 298:3-4).
    </p>
    <p>
        Those who hear <em>havdala</em> also need to see the candlelight. One
        who is standing far away should move closer so that he may benefit from
        the light - close enough for him to see the lines in his palm and the
        base of his fingernails. One who heard <em>havdala</em> but did not see
        the flame has fulfilled his obligation of <em>havdala</em> but has not
        fulfilled the mitzva to thank God for fire. It is a mitzva for him to
light a candle and recite the <em>berakha</em> of "        <em>borei me’orei ha-esh</em>" (MB 297:13; 298:13). If he saw the flame
        but was not close enough to make out the lines on his palm, he should
        not make the <em>berakha</em> again, since some maintain that he
        fulfilled his obligation by seeing the candle (<em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em>
        quoted by <em>Beit Yosef</em> 298:4; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 298:22).
    </p>
    <p>
        Those who beautify the mitzva turn off the electric light when reciting
        the <em>berakha</em> over the candle, so that the benefit they derive
        from the candlelight is evident, and so that even those who are
        standing far away will be able to see the lines of their palms by its
        light (see SSK 61:33).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may make the <em>berakha</em> only over a candle that was lit to
        provide light, not over a candle lit to honor someone or something. For
example, one does not make the <em>berakha</em> over a<em>yahrzeit</em> candle or over the candles placed in front of the        <em>ĥazan </em>in in the synagogue, because those are candles that are
        lit for honor, not to provide light (MB 298:30).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some Aĥaronim made the <em>berakha</em> of <em>Me’orei Ha-esh</em> over
        an electric light bulb, since electricity has the status of fire.
        However, many maintain that one should not make the <em>berakha</em>
        over an electric bulb because it is not considered fire; fire requires
        oxygen, and there is no oxygen in electric bulbs, only a heated metal
        filament. Furthermore, even if an electric light bulb can be considered
        fire, one should not make the <em>berakha</em> over fire covered by
        glass. Since this <em>berakha</em> was established to remind us of the
        fire that Adam produced on Saturday night, it must be similar to that
        fire - open, without a glass cover.

        7. The Latest Time to Make <em>Havdala</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        If one did not make <em>havdala</em> over a <em>kos</em> on Saturday
        night, whether due to circumstances beyond his control such as a
        soldier on a mission, forgetfulness, or even on purpose, according to
the majority of Rishonim (Rambam, <em>Tosafot</em>, Rosh), he may make        <em>havdala</em> until the end of Tuesday, since the first three days
        of the week are linked to the previous Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others maintain that a missed <em>havdala</em> can be made up on Sunday
        only (Ge’onim), and there is one who maintains that even this only
applies if one has not eaten anything since the end of Shabbat (<em>Behag</em>). There are some who defer to this opinion and make        <em>havdala</em> on a <em>kos</em> only until Sunday, and only on
condition that nothing was eaten on Saturday night (        <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 299:26).
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, however, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that one who did
        not make <em>havdala</em> Saturday night, even if he has eaten, should
        make <em>havdala</em> over wine with the <em>berakha</em> by the end of
Tuesday (SA and Rema 299:6; MB 19). This applies to the<em>berakhot</em> of <em>Ha-gafen</em> and <em>Ha-mavdil</em>, but the        <em>berakhot</em> over fragrances and fire are made only on Saturday
        night. For it is only on Saturday night that we need to revive the soul
        with the smell of the fragrances, and the <em>berakha</em> over fire
        was instituted specifically to remember the fire that Adam discovered
        on Saturday night. Neither of those is relevant on Sunday.
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
8. The Prohibition of Eating and Doing <em>Melakha</em> before        <em>Havdala</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as there is a mitzva to extend the sanctity of Shabbat into
        Friday, there is a mitzva to extend it into Saturday night. Therefore,
        one must be careful not to perform any <em>melakha</em> until several
        minutes after <em>tzeit</em>. After that, according to Torah law one
        may resume <em>melakha</em> even without making <em>havdala</em>, but
the Sages enacted that one may only do <em>melakha </em>after reciting<em>havdala</em> in the <em>berakha</em> of <em>Ata Ĥonen</em> in the<em>Amida</em> or by reciting the phrase "        <em>barukh ha-mavdil bein kodesh le-ĥol</em>" ("blessed is the One Who
        distinguishes between the sacred and the mundane"). Before this
        recitation, one may not even perform <em>melakhot </em>that are
        rabbinically prohibited (SA 299:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the importance of reciting <em>havdala</em> over a cup of
        wine, the Sages prohibited eating and drinking after <em>shki’a</em>
        until one makes <em>havdala </em>over wine. However, one may drink
        water then, as it is not deemed significant (SA 299:1). Other Aĥaronim
        maintain one may not even drink water (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>299:6).
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, one may only do <em>melakha </em>after making <em>havdala</em>
        verbally, and one may only eat or drink after making <em>havdala</em>
        over wine.
    </p>
    <p>
Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that when making a <em>zimun</em> at<em>se’uda shlishit</em> over a cup of wine, the leader of the        <em>zimun</em> drinks from the wine after <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>.
        Although it is already after <em>tzeit</em>, drinking the wine is
deemed a continuation of the meal. Just as one who began s        <em>e’uda shlishit</em> may continue eating even after <em>shki’a</em>
and <em>tzeit</em>, so too one may drink the wine from the        <em>zimun</em> (SA 299:4).
    </p>
    <p>
Others maintain that since people do not always insist on making a        <em>zimun</em> over a cup of wine, the wine is not considered a direct
        continuation of <em>se’uda shlishit</em>, and therefore one may not
        drink it before <em>havdala</em> (MA, MB 299:14). Those who follow this
opinion save the cup of wine from the <em>zimun</em> until after        <em>Ma’ariv</em>, when they make <em>havdala</em> over it. If newlyweds
        are present at <em>se’uda shlishit</em>, since <em>Sheva Berakhot</em>
        are recited over the cup of wine, one also makes the <em>berakha</em>
        over the wine then. The person leading the <em>zimun</em> drinks from
        it, as do the bride and groom.
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Shabbat has ended, one may make <em>havdala</em> over wine even
        before praying <em>Ma’ariv</em> (MA 489:7; MB 18). When he later prays,
he should recite <em>Ata Ĥonantanu</em>. The one reciting        <em>havdala</em> must remember not to drink a <em>revi’it</em> of wine,
        though. If he does so, he is considered under its influence and may not
        pray until the wine wears off (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 5:11).

According to Rambam, <em>She’iltot</em>, <em>Smag</em>,            <em>Ĥinukh</em>, and most <em>poskim</em>, <em>havdala</em> is a
            Torah obligation, included in the mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em>. Just
            as women are obligated by Torah law in <em>kiddush</em>, so too
            they are obligated by Torah law in <em>havdala</em>. Even according
            to Rosh and those Rishonim who maintain that <em>havdala</em> is a
rabbinic obligation, many explain that the Sages modeled it after<em>kiddush</em>. Accordingly, just as women are obligated in            <em>kiddush</em>, so too they are obligated in <em>havdala</em>.
            This is the opinion of Me’ iri, <em>Nimukei Yosef</em> quoting
            Ritva, and <em>Magid Mishneh</em>. However, <em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em>
            states that the rabbinic requirement of <em>havdala</em> is not
            connected to the mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em>, and therefore women are
            exempt, since it is a time-dependent positive commandment. Rema
            takes this opinion into account and writes that therefore women
            should not make <em>havdala</em> for themselves, but rather should
listen to a man make <em>havdala</em> (296:8). However,            <em>Baĥ</em>, MA, and other Aĥaronim state that a woman who wants
to make <em>havdala</em> may do so, since according to most            <em>poskim</em> a woman may perform and recite <em>berakhot</em> on
            time-dependent positive <em>mitzvot</em> from which she is exempt.
            This is also the position of Rema 589:6. Even though according to
            SA women do not make a <em>berakha</em> before performing a mitzva
            from which they are exempt, nevertheless, since the decisive
majority of <em>poskim</em> feel that women are obligated in<em>havdala</em> (quite possibly by Torah law), they may make            <em>havdala</em> for themselves and not worry that they might be
            guilty of making a <em>berakha le-vatala</em> (a blessing in vain).
            Furthermore, a man who has already fulfilled his obligation may, if
            necessary, make <em>havdala</em> for them. BHL implies that women
should not make a <em>berakha</em> over the candle since this            <em>berakha</em> is not really a part of <em>havdala</em>. This is
            the ruling in SSK 58:16 as well. However, many Aĥaronim find this
            surprising, and maintain that the <em>berakha</em> over the candle
            is considered part of <em>havdala</em> and that women who are
            making <em>havdala</em> should recite all four <em>berakhot</em>.
            Indeed, this is the position of <em>Igrot Moshe</em> <em>ĤM</em>
            2:47:2, <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:27, and <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
            14:43.

            One who heard the <em>berakha </em>of <em>Ha-mavdil </em>but did
            not hear the <em>berakha</em> of <em>Ha-gafen</em> has fulfilled
            the mitzva of <em>havdala</em>. This is because only the person
            reciting <em>havdala</em> must make the <em>berakha</em> over the
wine, whereas those who are listening fulfill their obligation            <em>be-di’avad</em> even if they do not hear that <em>berakha</em>
            (SSK 47:40, n. 187).

There are many different positions on this question.            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 8:16 writes, based on a number of Aĥaronim,
            that one may make <em>havdala</em> on black coffee and the like.
            SSK 60:6-7 is also inclined to be lenient regarding coffee, but
            writes that one should not make <em>havdala</em> over soft drinks.
R. Mordechai Eliyahu and R. Dov Lior are lenient and allow<em>havdala</em> to be made over soft drinks as well (            <em>Ha-morim Ba-keshet</em>, p. 14). This is also the opinion of R.
            Naĥum Rabinovitch (<em>Melumdei Milĥama</em>, p. 206). In contrast,
            R. Ovadia Yosef (<em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 3:19) mentions opinions of
            stringent Aĥaronim who insist that <em>havdala</em> may be recited
            only over alcoholic beverages. He rules stringently in practice
            because this could involve a <em>berakha le-vatala</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
Since there are differing opinions, one should not make            <em>havdala</em> over a non-alcoholic beverage. However, it seems
            that under extenuating circumstances, when one is unable to attain
            wine or alcoholic drinks, he may rely on the lenient opinions.
After all, there are Rishonim who maintain that one may recite the            <em>berakha </em>of <em>Ha-mavdil</em> without any beverage at all.
Maharam of Rothenburg quotes this position in the name of R. Simĥa.<em>Tur</em> states that this position is also found in            <em>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</em>. Furthermore, it would seem to be
            the position of Rif and Rosh, who maintain that in a case where one
            must do <em>melakha</em> before making <em>havdala</em> over a cup
            of wine, he should say the <em>berakha</em> of <em>Ha-mavdil</em>,
            including God’s name, even without a cup of wine, and do what he
            needs to do. Later on he should make <em>havdala</em> over wine.
            Even though the <em>halakha </em>does not follow this opinion, we
            nevertheless see that some say one may recite <em>ha-mavdil </em>
            without wine. Therefore, in a case of necessity one may rely on
            those who permit making <em>havdala</em> over a dignified
            non-alcoholic beverage.

            Some leading Aĥaronim made the <em>berakha</em> on Saturday night
            over an electric bulb. They wanted to dispel the mistaken notion
            that electricity is not fire and may be activated on Shabbat. It
            was thus the custom of R. Ĥayim of Brisk, R. Ĥayim Ozer Grodzinski,
            and the Rogatchover Gaon to make <em>havdala </em>on electric
            light. However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that one should not
            make the <em>berakha</em> over an electric light, since it does not
            burn with the aid of oxygen like fire does. Additionally, a light
            bulb has a glass cover, and according to SA 298:15 one does not
            make the <em>berakha</em> over a candle inside of glass, and BHL
            states that this is the opinion of many <em>poskim</em>, because a
            covered fire is not similar to the fire produced by Adam. This is
also the explanation of <em>Har Tzvi</em>, OĤ 2:114 and<em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, OĤ 1:17-18. All agree that the            <em>berakha </em>may not be recited over a fluorescent bulb,
            because its light is from gas, not a filament (SSK 61:32).

If one has no access to either wine or <em>ĥamar medina</em> for            <em>havdala</em>, but knows that he will have access by midday the
            next day, many <em>poskim</em> maintain that he may not eat or
            drink until he makes <em>havdala</em> over wine on Sunday (Rosh).
            If he is weak and finds it difficult to fast, he may be lenient and
rely on those who maintain that since he does not have wine for            <em>havdala</em>, he may eat on Saturday night (SA 296:3; MB 21).

SA 299:4 rules that one should drink from the wine used for            <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>, even after <em>tzeit</em> on Saturday
            night. Rema and MB 299:14 state that this is specifically when one
usually uses wine for the <em>zimun</em>, following the opinions of            <em>Tosafot</em> and Rosh. But for those who follow Rif and Rambam,
who maintain that it is not necessary to do a <em>zimun</em> over a<em>kos</em>, it is forbidden to drink from the cup before            <em>havdala</em> (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</em> 5:13). If
            one concluded the <em>berakha</em> during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>
            , when it is unclear whether it is day or night, he may drink the
            wine. Some maintain that even if there is no obligation to use wine
            for a <em>zimun</em>, one who wishes to do so fulfills a mitzva and
            may therefore drink the wine even before <em>havdala</em>. In
            practice, there are many who do not drink from the wine used for
            the <em>zimun</em> at <em>se’uda shlishit</em>, while many
            Sephardim do. In any event, regarding <em>Sheva Berakhot</em>, the
vast majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that one makes the<em>berakha</em> over the wine and drinks it. See            <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 4:69; <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 3:113; SSK
            59:17; and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 291:19.
