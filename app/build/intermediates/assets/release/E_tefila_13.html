    Chapter Thirteen: <em>Korbanot</em> - The Passages of the Sacrificial Offerings
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. Is It an Obligation to Recite the <em>Korbanot</em> Passages?
</h2>
<p>
    Every morning before prayer, we have the custom to recite the passage of the <em>Tamid</em> offering. However, <em>Chazal</em> did not officially institute
this practice, and therefore, its recital is not considered to be an absolute obligation. Still, the recital of the <em>Tamid</em> passage is based on    <em>Chazal</em>'s words in the Talmud (as will be clarified further). Moreover, the <em>Chachamim</em> established the time of the <em>Shacharit</em>
    prayer to correspond to the morning <em>Tamid</em> offering. Therefore, Jews have been accustomed to recite the <em>Tamid</em> section every day and its
    recital eventually became obligatory. <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, it is correct to recite the passage of the <em>Ketoret</em> (incense) every day before prayer, for it too, was brought daily. The <em>Zohar</em>
(<em>Vayakhel</em> 218:2) emphasizes the great benefits from its daily recital. Hence, it is proper that even one who is in a hurry says the passage of the    <em>Tamid</em> offering and the verses of the<em> Ketoret</em>.
</p>
<p>
The remaining paragraphs and prayers printed as part of the <em>Korbanot</em> passages are important as well; however, their recital is not obligatory.    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    When someone does not have time to say the <em>Tamid</em> paragraph, the verses of the <em>Ketoret</em>, and all of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, it is best
    that he omit Psalm 30 ("<em>Mizmor Shir Chanukat HaBayit L'David</em>," and <em>Sephardim</em> begin "<em>Aromimcha Hashem</em>") so that he can recite
    them. If time does not allow him, he should also omit <em>Hodu LaHashem</em>. It is even permissible to skip <em>Vayevarech David</em>, <em>Az Yashir</em>,
    and <em>Yehi Chevod </em>in order to recite the paragraph of the <em>Tamid</em> offering and the verses of the <em>Ketoret</em>. This is because the
foundation for the recital of the <em>Tamid</em> passage and verses of the <em>Ketoret</em> is in the Talmud, whereas the other passages were added to<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> by the <em>Savora'im</em> and <em>Geonim</em>. However, one may not skip the main parts of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, meaning<em>Baruch She'amar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em> through the end of the <em>Halleluyot</em>, and <em>Yishtabach</em>, in order to say the verses of the    <em>Korbanot</em>, since those main parts of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> are obligatory. Those passages are so important that the <em>Chachamim</em> even
    instituted saying blessings upon their recital.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

    2. The Reason for the Recital of the <em>Korbanot</em> and the Different Stages of Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>korbanot</em> express the absolute connection between the Jewish people and our Father in Heaven. This is a connection of such strong yearning for
    the Source of Life, for absolute perfection, that one is willing to surrender everything to Hashem, even life itself. At times, this desire intensifies
    when a person feels the acute contrast between his pure soul and his body, which possesses urges that pull him down towards vileness and sin. In order to
attain atonement for his soul, he wishes to devote his soul to the sanctification of Heaven and to sacrifice himself to Hashem. However,    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> created man so that he may live and be an active partner in the rectification of the world (<em>tikun olam</em>), and therefore
    those feelings of longing for absolute devotion to God are expressed through the <em>korbanot</em>. Instead of a person sacrificing himself, he offers his
    animal, just as Avraham Avinu was ready to fulfill the will of the Creator and sacrifice Yitzchak, his only son, to Hashem, until Hashem commanded him to
    sacrifice the ram in his place.
</p>
<p>
    There are four stages in the prayer service and the passages of the <em>Korbanot</em> are the first stage. As a result of one's sleep, a person is
    submerged in his corporeality, and in order to be able to stand before Hashem in prayer, he must first awaken and sacrifice his soul to the Master of the
    Universe by reciting <em>Korbanot</em>. Subsequently, he can purify his soul through <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> with songs and praises to Hashem. From
    there, he can accept upon himself the yoke of Heaven in <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em>. Finally, he is able to rise to the highest level
    of prayer within when he stands before the Master of the Universe in the <em>Amidah</em>, and praises, pleads, and gives thanks. By praying in that manner,
    blessing is bestowed upon the world in abundance.
</p>
<p>
    The Kabbalah explains that the four stages of prayer correspond to four worlds (or realms), and that during the course of the prayer service, we ascend
    from the lowest world to the highest. The <em>Korbanot</em> correspond to the world of action (<em>asiyah</em>), <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> correspond to
    the world of formation (<em>yetzirah</em>), <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> to the world of creation (<em>beriah</em>), and the <em>Amidah</em> to the highest
    world, the world of emanation (<em>atzilut</em>).
</p>
<p>
    The service of Hashem begins with a person's complete acceptance upon himself that Hashem is God, and that there is no value to materialism and to life in
    this world as long as it remains separate from the service of Hashem. The bringing of <em>korbanot</em> expresses in the most concrete manner the
    nullification of materialism and life in this world before Hashem. Therefore, the recital of <em>Korbanot</em> corresponds to the world of action, because
    in that world all great concepts are realized in a practical and tangible manner.
</p>
<p>
    Afterwards, we say <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, which correspond to the world of formation. Following the surrender of materialism, a person's spirit is
    released from its chains. It is then able to reflect upon the wonders of creation and to sing and praise Hashem.
</p>
<p>
    From the spiritual ascent of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, we are able to recognize that the world is God's creation, and to accept upon ourselves the
    complete yoke of Heaven. In the <em>Korbanot</em>, we do not entirely realize the fundamentals of faith; we only express our willingness to forgo
    everything for the sake of our belief. However, after the <em>Korbanot</em> and <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, we can elevate ourselves to complete faith in
    Hashem, as is set forth in <em>Keriat Shema</em> and expanded upon in its <em>berachot</em>. This stage corresponds to the world of creation, in which we
    comprehend the root of all things.
</p>
<p>
    From there, we rise to the highest level, the world of emanation, in which we are totally devoted to the Master of the Universe and completely identify
    with the Divine ideals. Before this, we stood before Him, sacrificed ourselves to Him, sang songs and praises to Him, and took upon ourselves the yoke of
    His Kingdom. Now, in the <em>Amidah</em> prayer, we are entirely devoted to Him and identify with His will to reveal His Name in the world. Consequently,
    we bless Him and pray that He bestow His abundant blessings upon the world.
</p>
<p>
After that, we descend in the order of the worlds. The <em>Tachanun</em> prayer still corresponds to the world of emanation. In <em>Ashrei</em> and    <em>U'va L'Tzion</em>, we bring the influence of prayer down to the world of creation; after that, in <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, to the world of formation,
    and in <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, to the world of action (see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 48:1, s.v. "<em>V'da Hakdamah</em>").
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. The Source for the Recital of the <em>Korbanot</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Ta'anit</em> 27b and <em>Megillah</em> 31b) that when Hashem entered a covenant with Avraham Avinu and promised him that
    he and his children would inherit the Land of Israel, Avraham asked <em>HaKadosh</em> <em>Baruch Hu</em>, "Master of the Universe, perhaps, Heaven forbid,
    the nation of Israel will sin before You, and You will do to them as You did to the generation of the flood and the generation of the dispersion?" Hashem
    answered, "I will not do that to them." Avraham said, "How will I know that You will not destroy their name?" Hashem responded, "Bring me three calves..." By
    that, He hinted to him that the institution of the <em>korbanot</em> will be witness to the eternal connection between Israel and Hashem. Therefore, even
    if sins should be found within the Jewish nation, it is only because of external influences - in their core the Jewish people are righteous and are all
    connected to Hashem. Therefore, by the offering of <em>korbanot</em>, an act which expresses Israel's absolute devotion to Hashem, their sins will be
    atoned.
</p>
<p>
Avraham Avinu said before Him, "Master of the Universe, and what will be when the Temple will be destroyed; how will their sins be atoned?"    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> answered, "I have already instituted the <em>Korbanot</em> passages for them. Every time they recite them, I will consider it
    as if they are bringing an offering before Me, and I will forgive them for all their sins."
</p>
<p>
Further, the <em>Chachamim</em> say that anyone who engages himself in the laws of the <em>Chatat</em> (sin) offering, it is as if he offered a    <em>Chatat</em>; and anyone who engrosses himself in the laws of the <em>Asham</em> (guilt) offering, it is as if he offered an <em>Asham</em>. Likewise,
    when one engages himself in the laws of any of the <em>korbanot</em>, it is as if he brought those offerings (<em>Menachot</em> 110a).
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind this is that every deed performed in the world possesses an inner soul. The soul of a mitzvah is the words of Torah that discuss that
    mitzvah. These ideas especially pertain to the <em>korbanot</em>, for the essence of the <em>korbanot</em> is to express our connection to Hashem.
Therefore, when one cannot actually bring the offerings, the study of them is considered a substitute for their sacrifice (see also <em>Maharal</em>,    <em>Gevurot</em> <em>Hashem</em>, chapter 8).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. The <em>Korbanot</em> Passages
</h2>
<p>
    We open the section of the <em>Korbanot</em> with the passage of the <em>Akeidah</em>, describing the sacrifice of Yitzchak. The readiness of Avraham Avinu
    to bring his only son as an offering is the ultimate sacrifice, and this is the foundation for all the commandments involving <em>korbanot</em>. Further,
    its recital awakens our hearts to the love of Hashem and to serve Him in total devotion. Moreover, in its recital we mention the merit of our forefathers -
    after the <em>Akeidah</em> passage, we request that Hashem, in the merit of the sacrifice of Yitzchak, have mercy on us and redeem us.
</p>
<p>
After that, it is customary to recite words of inspiration in preparation for prayer and for the service of Hashem, including the first section of "    <em>Shema Yisrael</em>." According to the <em>Yerushalmi</em>, we end with the <em>berachah</em>, "Blessed are You Hashem, Who sanctifies Your Name among
the multitudes," and that is true for <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>. However, since this <em>berachah</em> is not mentioned in the <em>Talmud</em>    <em>Bavli</em>, those praying in <em>Nusach Sephard</em> recite the blessing, "Blessed is the Sanctifier of His Name among the multitudes," without saying
    Hashem's Name.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
Next, we arrive at the <em>Korbanot</em> passages themselves. According to the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em>, we first recite the paragraph of the    <em>Kiyor</em> (laver) and the passage regarding the <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> (the removal of ashes), for the <em>Kohanim</em> would start the work in the
    Temple with them every morning. Furthermore, just as the <em>Kohanim</em> would become purified in preparation for their work by washing their hands and
    feet in the <em>Kiyor</em>, our recital of the passage of the <em>Kiyor</em> in the <em>Shacharit</em> service purifies us in preparation for prayer.
</p>
<p>
    Afterwards, according to all <em>minhagim</em>, the <em>Tamid</em> passage is recited, and we request that its recital be considered as if we are bringing
    a <em>Tamid</em> offering. Subsequently, we recite the verses of the <em>Ketoret</em> and we say rabbinic explanations regarding its mixture.
</p>
<p>
    We then add verses of praise and recite the paragraph, "Abayei listed the order of the altar service," which is a small summary of the work in the Temple.
    We then recite the poem, "<em>Ana B'Cho'ach</em>," which also alludes to the sacrificing of <em>korbanot</em>, and we conclude with a prayer requesting
    that our words be considered as if we actually offered the <em>Korban</em> <em>Tamid</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Korbanot</em> passages must be recited after<em> amud hashachar</em>, for that is the time to bring the offerings (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 1:6;
    47:13). There are those who say that it is good to recite them while standing, following the example of the <em>Kohanim</em> who would stand while the
sacrificial offerings were being brought (based on the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 48:1). Nevertheless, according to most    <em>poskim</em>, one need not stand, and that is the Sephardic<em> minhag</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 1:33).
</p>
<p>
    After that, we say the chapter, "<em>Eizehu mekoman shel zevachim</em>" ("What is the location of the offerings?") (<em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Zevachim</em>
    chapter 5). There are two reasons for its recital. First, it explains the place of the sacrifice and the sprinkling of the blood of the <em>korbanot</em>,
and its recital corresponds to the offering of those <em>korbanot</em>. Second, the <em>Chachamim</em> wanted every Jew to learn Scripture,    <em>Mishnah</em>, and Talmud every day (see <em>Kiddushin</em> 30a). When one recites the <em>Tamid</em> passage, he fulfills the obligation to learn
    Scripture. When he recites this chapter, he fulfills the obligation of learning <em>Mishnah</em>. Subsequently, he recites a <em>beraita</em> attributed to
    Rabbi Yishmael concerning the thirteen methods through which the Torah is elucidated, thereby fulfilling the obligation to learn Talmud.
</p>
<p>
    Although the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> writes (<em>Orach Chaim</em> 1:5) that it is best to recite all the <em>Korbanot</em> passages, namely, the passage of
the <em>Olah</em> (burnt offering), <em>Minchah</em> (meal offering), <em>Shelamim</em> (peace offering), <em>Chatat </em>(sin offering), and    <em>Asham</em> (guilt offering) (from the Torah portions of <em>Vayikra</em> and <em>Tzav</em>), in actuality, it was not customary to recite them, and
they were not even printed in <em>siddurim</em>. There are those who say that by reciting the chapter, "<em>Eizehu mekoman</em>," within which all the    <em>korbanot</em> are mentioned, one fulfills to a certain extent the learning of those matters (<em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 1:9; <em>Eshel Avraham</em>
    ). It is proper that every year when we arrive at the Torah-reading portions of <em>Vayikra</em> and <em>Tzav</em> we learn them well, for one who learns
    them is considered as if he sacrificed the offerings (<em>Menachot</em> 110a).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Reason for the <em>Tamid</em> Offering
</h2>
<p>
    As we learned (in halachah 1), one should be meticulous in saying the verses of the <em>Tamid</em> offering and the <em>Ketoret</em> daily; therefore, we
    will somewhat clarify their subject matter.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Tamid</em> offering is the most important of the <em>korbanot</em> since it is the most constant; every day of the year it was brought, once in the
    morning and once in the afternoon. For that reason, it is the <em>korban</em> that represents the continuous connection between the nation of Israel and
    our Father in Heaven.
</p>
<p>
    All of Israel participated in the bringing of the <em>Tamid</em> offering, since it was bought with the money collected from the half-shekel that every
    Jew, rich and poor alike, donated each year to the Temple. It therefore symbolizes the unity of Israel.
</p>
<p>
    Because Israel is the heart of the nations, Hashem's unity is expressed through the bringing of the <em>Tamid</em> offering, for the entire world connects
    to the Source of Life via that single <em>Tamid</em> offering (see <em>Maharal Netiv HaAvodah</em> 1).
</p>
<p>
    The course of life consists of birth, development, and eventually death. Every day, people die, some due to old age, others as a result of accidents or
    diseases. In the animal kingdom as well, myriads of living creatures die daily. The same holds true for plant life; every day millions of trees, bushes,
    and flowers wither and wilt. The big question is: what is the significance of this whole process? Is this an inconsequential cycle of life and death,
lacking purpose and meaning? Or perhaps there is a general direction towards which all life aspires? An answer to this question lies in the    <em>Korban Tamid</em>. The entire world strives towards elevation and perfection. Part of this elevation is accomplished through growth and development;
    another part is achieved through death. This cessation of physical life is not for naught. In actuality, it is a sacrificial offering, which expresses the
    endeavor towards perfection. Because it is impossible in this world to achieve perfection, after completing all the possible actions and feasible
    elevations, one's spirit continues to yearn for ascent but his body ages, his vessel becomes worn out, and his spirit detaches from his body and rises,
    returning to its origin. That is why the <em>Kohanim</em> would bring the <em>Tamid</em> offering in the most sacred place in the world, once in the
    morning and once in the afternoon. This <em>korban</em> was representative of all physical life that had ceased to exist in this world on that day. The
    bringing of the <em>Korban Tamid</em> gave that life meaning, the significance being its return to its origin and its spiritual ascent as a pleasing
    fragrance to God (see <em>Maharal Netiv HaAvodah</em> 1).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The Reason for the <em>Ketoret</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Just as the <em>Tamid</em> offering was brought daily, the <em>Ketoret</em> (incense) was also brought every day, half in the morning and half in the
    afternoon. The <em>Korban Tamid</em> expresses Israel's connection to Hashem, and the bond that all worldly creations have to their source of life.
    Therefore its organs were offered on the exterior altar, visible to all. However, the <em>Ketoret</em> gives expression to the deep inner connection
    between Israel and Hashem, and therefore it was offered on the interior altar inside the Temple. The <em>Tamid</em> offering connects all creations in
    their material and tangible components to Hashem. For that reason, the essence of the offering was the blood thrown on the altar and the organs offered
    upon it. The <em>Korban HaKetoret</em>, on the other hand, is the quintessential spiritual offering, epitomized by the incomparably pleasing scent that
    emanates from the spices of the incense.
</p>
<p>
    Through the <em>Ketoret</em>, a sublime spiritual light appears in the world which illuminates the inner souls of all creations and connects everything to
    holiness. Therefore, it was made out of spices that exude a pleasant scent, for smell is the most refined and spiritual pleasure there is in the world. The
    scent extends in all directions, to hint that all creations are influenced by an inner spiritual illumination that elevates them and binds them to holiness
    (<em>Olat Ra'ayah</em> p. 135).
</p>
<p>
    There were eleven spices in the <em>Ketoret</em>, all grounded thoroughly together so that they would be united completely, producing a favorable scent.
    Similarly, by unifying all powers completely for the sake of holiness, the world is uplifted and repaired.
</p>
<p>
    One of the primary spices in the incense is the <em>chelbenah</em> (galbanum), which alludes to the sinners of Israel, who, in their roots, are equally
connected to the sanctity of Israel. The <em>chelbenah</em> had a particularly foul aroma. However, blended with the special mixture of the    <em>Ketoret</em>, its odor would transform to good; instead of ruining the fragrance of the <em>Ketoret</em>, the addition of the <em>chelbenah</em> would
    make the smell of the <em>Ketoret </em>even more praiseworthy. This comes to teach us that when all the forces of Israel unite for the sake of a sanctified
goal, the inner merit of the sinners of Israel is revealed, and they too join to aid in the rectification of the Jewish nation and the world (see    <em>Olat Ra'ayah</em>, part 1, pp. 136-138).

            After writing that it is best to recite the passages of the <em>Korbanot</em>, <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 1:9 writes, "Nevertheless, whoever is
            capable of understanding and learning need not recite even the passages of <em>Korbanot</em> every day, rather from time to time it is enough to
            say the paragraph <em>Eizehu</em> <em>Mekoman</em>" If a person knows that an action that he did requires him to bring a certain offering, such as
an <em>Olah</em> for the nullification of a positive commandment, or for sinful thoughts of the heart concerning a negative commandment, or a            <em>Todah</em> for the four [people] who need to give thanks, he should say the passage of that particular offering immediately when he is
            obligated to offer one." However, concerning the <em>Tamid</em> offering in section 48:1 he writes, "All of Israel became accustomed and took it
            upon themselves as an obligation to recite the passage of the <em>Tamid</em> daily... and it is good to recite the passage of the <em>Ketoret</em> as
            well... There are those who are accustomed to recite the paragraph, 'Abayei listed the order of the altar service...' and <em>Ribon HaOlamim</em>..."
There he refers to the custom that the congregation only recites the <em>Tamid</em> passage. This distinction can also be inferred from the            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> because in section 48 it is implied that everyone says the <em>Tamid</em> passage, whereas concerning the <em>Akeidah</em>
and the remaining <em>korbanot</em>, he writes (1:5), "It is good to recite it." Regarding the paragraph of the <em>Kiyor</em> (laver) and the            <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> (passage concerning the removal of ashes printed in Ashkenazic <em>siddurim</em>) and the <em>Ketoret</em>,<em> </em>he
            writes in section 1:9, "There are those who are accustomed to recite it." This is also what is implied from the <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em>
            1:17 where he rules that a mourner does not recite the <em>Korbanot</em> passages. Similarly, on Tishah B'Av (554:7 and 559:20) he says the passage
of the <em>Tamid</em> offering but not the other <em>Korbanot</em>. Although according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 554:4 all the            <em>Korbanot</em> are recited, as the <em>Sephardim</em> practice, nevertheless, we learned that only the recital of the <em>Tamid</em> is
            obligatory in contrast to the recital of the remaining <em>Korbanot</em>.
        </p>

    <div id="ftn2">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
The source for the recital of the <em>berachot</em> before and after <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> is in the enactment of            <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> or the <em>Tanna'im</em> (see further in this book, chapter 14, note 1), and they were instituted to be said on
            the praise we give Hashem. The most important praise is the Psalm "<em>Tehillah L'David</em>" (<em>Ashrei</em>), as explained in <em>Berachot</em>
            4b, and next are all the <em>Halleluyot</em>, which continue until the end of Psalms, as clarified in <em>Shabbat</em> 118b, according to the
interpretation of the <em>Rif</em> and the <em>Rosh</em>. The source for the recital of the <em>Tamid</em> passage is in the <em>Gemara</em> in<em>Ta'anit</em> 27b and in <em>Megillah</em> 31b. However, it is not mentioned there as an obligation or even as a daily custom, and no            <em>berachah</em> is recited upon it. Therefore, the main parts of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> precede the <em>Tamid</em> passage in order of
            importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first Psalm that may be skipped is <em>Mizmor Shir Chanukat HaBayit</em> (<em>Sephardim</em> begin from <em>Aromimcha</em>), because its
recital only began approximately 300 years ago as a continuation of the recital of the <em>Tamid</em>. If one must skip more, he should skip            <em>Hodu LaHashem</em>, since the basis for its recital lies in the custom to recite it when the <em>Tamid</em> offering was brought in the Temple,
            and therefore it was customary to recite it after reciting the passage of the <em>Tamid</em>. If so, certainly the recital of the <em>Tamid</em> is
            more important than the recital of <em>Hodu</em>. <em>Yehi Chevod</em>, <em>Vayevarech David</em>, and <em>Az Yashir</em> are additions from the
            time of the <em>Savora'im</em> and <em>Geonim</em>, and therefore it seems that the recital of the <em>Tamid</em>, whose source is in the Talmud,
is more important than their recital. There is a difference in importance between the passage of the <em>Tamid</em> and that of the            <em>Ketoret</em>. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 554:7, who rules that on Tishah B'Av, <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> is not recited, for it is not part of
            the prayers of that day, but the <em>Tamid</em> passage is recited. (Although according to <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 559:48 it is recited, still, we
            learn from the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> that there is a difference in their levels of importance). Just like the <em>Tamid</em>, where only the
            verses are recited, regarding the Ketoret too, it is permissible in times of need to fulfill the obligation of its recital with verses alone, and
            one can suffice with reciting <em>Chazal</em>'s additions on the <em>Ketoret</em> at the end of the prayer service (see further in this book, 23:5,
            note 5).

            The <em>Tosafot</em> in <em>Pesachim</em> 104b and <em>Berachot</em> 46a mention this <em>berachah</em> and explain that it does not begin with the
word "<em>Baruch</em>" because it is a blessing of thanks. However, the <em>Rambam</em> writes it without Hashem's Name. The <em>Tur</em>,<em>Orach Chaim</em> 46, calls it a <em>berachah</em> based on the <em>Yerushalmi</em> (although it does not appear in the wording of the            <em>Yerushalmi</em> before us). <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, based on the <em>Rambam</em> and the <em>Ari</em> in <em>Sha'ar HaKavanot</em>, does not
conclude it with Hashem's Name. The wording of the entire prayer from the words "<em>L'Olam Yeheh Adam</em>" is brought in            <em>Tanna D'vei Eliyahu Rabbah</em> chapter 21. According to <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, it is clear that since it is a <em>berachah</em>, it is
            proper to be stringent about its recital every day.
