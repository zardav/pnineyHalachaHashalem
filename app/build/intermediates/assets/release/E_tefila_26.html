    Chapter Twenty-Six: The Bedtime <em>Shema</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Passages of the Bedtime <em>Shema</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Berachot</em> 60b), "One who goes to sleep in bed must recite <em>Shema Yisrael</em> until <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em>,
    and the blessing <em>Baruch HaMapil Chevlei Sheinah</em>...." Likewise, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says, "Even if a person recited <em>Keriat Shema</em> in the
    synagogue, it is a mitzvah to recite it [again] on his bed." <em>Chazal</em> base their words on the verse (Psalms 4:5), "Meditate in your hearts [while]
    on your beds and be silent" (<em>Berachot</em> 4b).
</p>
<p>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi was accustomed to reciting an additional two Psalms before his sleep: "<em>Yoshev B'Seter Elyon</em>" (Psalm 91) and "    <em>Hashem Ma Rabu Tzarai</em>" (Psalm 3), which are useful in warding off the evil spirits (<em>Shevuot</em> 15b), and many follow his <em>minhag</em>.
    Further, throughout the generations, people became accustomed to adding on Psalms, verses, and prayers. Since these are late additions, there are
    differences between the <em>nusachim</em> of the various ethnic groups. Some say that it is good to recite the paragraph of <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em> as
    well, and others maintain that it is best to recite all three paragraphs.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
To summarize, in accordance with the enactment of the <em>Chachamim</em>, it is necessary to recite the paragraph of <em>Shema</em> and <em>Birkat</em>    <em>HaMapil</em> before one goes to sleep, but the remaining Psalms are not an obligation. The <em>minhag</em> to recite them became widespread because of
    the custom of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi (see <em>Magen Avraham</em> 239:2).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

<p>
    There are those who are strict to recite <em>Birkat</em> <em>HaMapil</em> immediately before they sleep, after reciting <em>Shema</em> and all the other
    verses. However, according to the custom of the kabbalists, <em>Birkat HaMapil</em> precedes <em>Shema</em> and the other verses. One who is concerned that
    he will fall asleep while reciting the prayers or before concluding them should start with <em>Shema</em> and <em>HaMapil</em>, thereby ensuring that
    before he falls asleep he recites the passages instituted by <em>Chazal</em> (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 239:2).

    <em>2. </em>
    The<em> HaMapil </em>Blessing<em></em>
</h2>
<p>
    Regarding the recital of <em>HaMapil</em>, some are concerned that perhaps they will not fall asleep and their <em>berachah</em> will have been said in
    vain. However, in practice, the fact that the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted reciting <em>HaMapil</em> means that they were not concerned about this. The
    blessing is a thanksgiving <em>berachah</em> to Hashem about sleep, and even for a person who does not succeed in falling asleep, the expression of thanks
    is not made in vain (<em>Chayei Adam</em> 35:4). Still, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of this <em>berachah</em> for
    those who intend to sleep, and therefore one who has no intention of sleeping does not recite <em>HaMapil</em> on that particular night.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>HaMapil</em> blessing is not recited on daytime sleep, although some say that it is good to say <em>Viyhi No'am</em> before a nap taken during the
    day (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 239:8 and see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> "<em>Samuch</em>"). <em>HaMapil</em> is also not recited on a temporary sleep at
    night. However, sleeping in one's bed for half an hour or more is considered a regular sleep (<em>Eshel Avraham</em> 239; <em>Beit Baruch</em> 35:10). A
    person who went to sleep at night after reciting <em>HaMapil</em>, arose later to attend to certain matters, and then went back to sleep, does not repeat
    the <em>HaMapil</em> blessing, since <em>HaMapil</em> is only recited once a night (<em>Beit Baruch</em> 35:9; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 239:1, note 4). One
who fell asleep without reciting <em>HaMapil</em>, and woke up in the middle of the night with the intention to continue sleeping, must recite the    <em>berachah</em> before falling asleep again. If he does not wish to get up from his bed and wash his hands, he may rub his hands on his blanket and then
    recite it (<em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 4:23; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 61; unlike <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 239:1 who maintains that washing one's
    hands is a requirement).
</p>
<p>
    There are those who learned, based on the Kabbalah<em> </em>of the<em> Arizal</em>, that only a person who goes to sleep before <em>chatzot</em> (halachic
    midnight) recites the <em>HaMapil</em> blessing, and whoever goes to sleep after <em>chatzot</em> does not. Hence, many <em>Sephardim</em> are accustomed
to reciting <em>HaMapil</em> without <em>Shem u'Malchut</em> (Hashem's Name) when going to sleep after <em>chatzot</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 239:8; see    <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em>, part 4, pp. 122-124). However, according to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em> and that of some <em>Sephardim</em>, as long as one
    goes to sleep before <em>amud hashachar</em>, <em>HaMapil</em> is recited.

    3. Additional Laws
</h2>
<p>
After reciting <em>Shema</em> and <em>HaMapil</em>, whoever must talk, eat, drink, or tend to an urgent matter is permitted to do so since <em>Birkat</em>    <em>HaMapil</em> is unlike <em>Birkot HaNehenin</em>, concerning which it is forbidden to interrupt between the <em>berachah</em> and the pleasure derived.
    Rather, it is a <em>berachah</em> of praise on the night's sleep. However, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is best to recite the bedtime <em>Shema</em>
    immediately before sleep (see <em>Rama</em> 239:1; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 7:27; <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 4, pp. 118-122; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 239:3;
    however <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 239:4 is stringent after <em>HaMapil</em>).
</p>
<p>
    One may recite the passages of the bedtime <em>Shema</em> while lying down, but he must be careful to lean on his side. There are a number of reasons why
    the <em>Chachamim</em> prohibited a man to sleep while lying on his back (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 239:6). However, before one's sleep, a man is permitted
    to read a book while lying on his back and it is unnecessary for him to turn on his side. Only when he is about to fall asleep must he beware of lying on
    his back (<em>Az Nidberu</em> 6:50).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Ba'alei Mussar</em> (Jewish ethicists who composed books of reproof for the nation) wrote that it is good for a person to make a personal
    accounting (<em>cheshbon nefesh</em>) before sleep. If he remembers sinning, he confesses his sin and takes it upon himself not to sin in that manner
    again. It is also proper that before going to sleep, every person forgives anyone who sinned against him or caused him harm, so that no one is punished
    because of him. By doing so, one merits long life (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 239:9).

The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted only the recital of the <em>Shema</em> paragraph before going to sleep, as the <em>Rif</em> (3:1),<em>Rambam</em>, and the <em>Rosh</em> (chapter 1, 6) write. However, in chapter 9, 23, the <em>Rosh</em> brings the opinion of<em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em> who maintains that <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em> is recited as well. Perhaps <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em> understood the            <em>Gemara</em>'s words "until <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em>" to mean, including <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em>. <em>Divrei Chamudot</em> 67 interprets
            that he is referring to a place in which <em>Ma'ariv</em> is recited before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, for there, in order to fulfill the mitzvah
of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, it is necessary to recite both paragraphs. <em>Rabbeinu Yerucham</em> (<em>netiv</em> 3, part 2) and            <em>Rabbeinu Yonah</em> in <em>Sefer HaYir'ah</em> write that all three paragraphs are recited, for together they contain 248 words, and saying
            them provides a special protection against harmful forces.

            It is written in <em>Berachot</em> 5a, "Rav Nachman says, One who is a <em>talmid chacham</em> need not [repeat <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>
            before going to sleep] (for his learning protects him). <em>Abayei</em> says that even a <em>talmid chacham</em> must say one verse concerning
Hashem's mercy, such as, 'Into Your hand I entrust my spirit. You redeem me, Hashem, God of truth' [(Psalms 31:6)]." The <em>Rif</em> and the<em>Rosh</em> agree that a <em>talmid chacham</em> is not obligated to repeat <em>Shema</em>. However, the <em>Rambam</em> and            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> do not mention this, implying that according to them, a <em>talmid chacham</em> must repeat it as well. Perhaps the source
for their opinion is in the <em>Yerushalmi</em> (chapter 1, halachah 1) which discusses <em>talmidei chachamim</em> who were accustomed to reciting            <em>Keriat Shema</em> a few times in order to fall asleep while saying <em>Keriat Shema</em>. Nevertheless, regarding the other verses, the recital
            of which is not obligatory, it seems that a <em>talmid chacham</em> can prefer to fall asleep while learning from a book or while deep in his
            thoughts. However, <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 239:1 writes that by reciting the passages of <em>Keriat Shema</em> according to the <em>Ari</em>, a
            restorative act (<em>tikun</em>) is performed to the world and therefore even a <em>talmid chacham</em> must say them.
