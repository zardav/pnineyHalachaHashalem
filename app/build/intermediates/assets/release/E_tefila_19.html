    Chapter Nineteen: The <em>Chazan</em>'s Repetition of the <em>Amidah</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Enactment of the <em>Amidah</em> Repetition (<em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>)
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>
    established that after individuals finish reciting the silent <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, the <em>chazan</em> repeats the <em>Amidah</em> out loud in order to
fulfill the obligation of prayer for those who do not know how to pray by themselves (<em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 34b). This repetition is known as    <em>Chazarat</em> <em>HaShatz</em>. However, for <em>Ma'ariv</em>, they did not institute an <em>Amidah</em> repetition since, in essence, <em>Ma'ariv</em>
    is an optional prayer (although nowadays it is an obligatory prayer, as explained further in this book 25:2) and consequently, there is no need to fulfill
    the obligation for those who are not well-versed in the passages of the prayer service.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted that the <em>chazan</em> also prays the silent <em>Amidah</em> in order to organize the prayer in his mind. Additionally,
    they instructed that even those who know how to pray by themselves listen to <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> and answer <em>Amen</em> after the <em>berachot</em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Because the <em>Amidah</em> repetition was enacted by <em>Chazal</em>, it must be recited even in a <em>minyan</em> in which all the people know how to
    pray by themselves. Even after it became permissible to put <em>Torah Sheb'al Peh</em> (the Oral Torah) into writing, including the wording of the prayers,
and though the use of <em>siddurim</em> has become common, the enactment of the <em>Chachamim</em> did not change. Moreover, today, when one rarely finds a<em>minyan</em> where someone needs to fulfill his obligation with <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, it is nevertheless recited, for the rule is that once the    <em>Chachamim</em> enact a law, distinctions are not made between cases in which the law applies, and those in which it does not (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
124:3, based on the responsa<em> </em>of the<em> Rambam</em>). Further, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted reciting <em>Kedushah</em> and    <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> in the repetition, and if the <em>Amidah</em> is not repeated, they will not be recited altogether (<em>Tur</em>).
</p>
<p>
    The Kabbalah clarifies that in addition to the simple explanation of why both the <em>Amidah</em> and its repetition are necessary, namely, to fulfill the
    obligation of one who is not proficient in the wording of the prayers, there is a sublime reason according to the secrets of Torah (<em>sod</em>), that the
    recital of both prayers together causes them to be more effective. Therefore, even today, when there is no need to fulfill the obligation of one who is not
    well-versed in prayer, the <em>chazan </em>must still recite the <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, for the hidden reason still stands.
</p>
<p>
    It is a great privilege to answer <em>Amen</em> to the <em>berachot</em> of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition. Even learning Torah is forbidden at that time
    (see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 124:2 and 16). The virtue of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition is greater than the virtue of the silent <em>Amidah.</em> Therefore,
    although the themes of the <em>Amidah</em> are supremely recondite, permission is granted to recite it aloud. Due to its profound virtue, there is no
concern that forces of impurity will take hold of it. The listeners must refrain from invalidating it by talking. It is said of one who chatters during    <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> "that he is sinning, and his transgression is too great to bear; therefore he must be rebuked" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:7).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. Who May Fulfill His Obligation by Hearing the <em>Amidah</em> Repetition?
</h2>
<p>
    Three conditions must exist in order for an individual to be able to fulfill his obligation of prayer by hearing the <em>Amidah</em> repetition.
</p>
<p>
    1) The individual must not be proficient in prayer. By contrast, one who knows how to pray is obligated to pray and beg for mercy on his own behalf; he
    cannot fulfill his obligation just by listening to the <em>chazan</em>. A person who can only pray with a <em>siddur</em>, and has arrived at a place where
    there are no <em>siddurim</em>, may, at that time, fulfill his obligation by hearing the <em>chazan</em>.
</p>
<p>
2) There must be ten men present, because the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted that individuals are only permitted to fulfill their obligation by hearing the    <em>chazan</em> in the presence of a <em>minyan</em>.
</p>
<p>
3) The listener must understand the <em>chazan</em>'s words. One who does not understand Hebrew cannot fulfill his obligation of prayer by listening to    <em>Chazarat HaShatz.</em>
</p>
<p>
Even though a person who knows how to pray is not allowed to fulfill his obligation with the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, if he already recited the<em>Amidah</em> and mistakenly omitted a part of the prayer which prevents him from fulfilling his obligation, he may fulfill it by hearing the<em>chazan</em>, since he has already requested mercy for himself. This includes a situation in which a person inadvertently omitted    <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> or <em>Chol HaMo'ed</em>, in which case he did not fulfill his obligation (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    124:10).<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    When a person has <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation by hearing the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, he must stand as one does for the <em>Amidah</em>,
with his feet together, and at the end of the <em>Amidah</em> take three steps back (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:1). He answers <em>Amen</em> after the    <em>berachot</em> and responds to <em>Kedushah</em>. However, he does not answer "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>" and in <em>Modim</em> he listens to
    the <em>chazan</em> and does not say <em>Modim d'Rabbanan</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:6; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 3). He must also be careful not to
    interrupt by talking; even if he hears another <em>minyan</em> reciting <em>Kaddish</em>, he may not answer. The <em>chazan</em> must be strict in saying
the whole <em>Amidah</em> aloud, for this is the law regarding <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, that it must be recited out loud in its entirety. Some    <em>chazanim</em> mistakenly say part of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Modim</em> quietly. Aside from the fact that the <em>chazan</em> does not completely fulfill
    the obligation to repeat the <em>Amidah</em>, there is reason to be concerned that perhaps there is a person present who wishes to fulfill his obligation
    with the repetition; however, since he does not hear the <em>chazan</em> recite the whole <em>Amidah</em>, he cannot do so (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    124:41).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. The Listener's Conduct
</h2>
<p>
The person who is listening must be careful to answer <em>Amen</em> after each and every <em>berachah</em> of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, as the<em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Berachot</em> 53b): "The one who answers <em>Amen</em> is greater than the one who recites the blessing." One must respond    <em>Amen</em> with the utmost solemnity, and while saying it, he must have <em>kavanah</em> that the content of the <em>berachah</em> is true. For
    instance, if one hears the <em>berachah</em>, "<em>SheHakol Nihiyah Bidvaro</em>," he must have in mind that everything truly comes into existence through
    God's word. When there is a request in the <em>berachah </em>as well, such as in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Chonen HaDa'at</em>, he should have in mind its two
meanings: 1) it is true that knowledge comes from Hashem; 2) the request that Hashem endow us with knowledge (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>124:6;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 25).
</p>
<p>
One may not recite <em>Amen</em> too hastily, by saying it before the <em>chazan</em> finishes the <em>berachah</em>; nor shall one abbreviate the    <em>Amen</em> by swallowing its letters, or pronounce it softly and in a weak voice. Also, one must not distance the response of <em>Amen</em> from the
conclusion of the <em>berachah</em>, for then it is called an "<em>Amen</em> <em>yetomah</em>" (an orphaned <em>Amen</em>) (see <em>Berachot</em> 47a;    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:8).
</p>
<p>
    The way a person responds <em>Amen</em> represents how he relates to belief in Hashem. When a person's faith is damaged, the life that Hashem bestows upon
    him is also impaired. This is what Ben Azai means when he says, "Whoever answers an '<em>Amen yetomah</em>' (an orphaned <em>Amen</em>) - his children will
    be orphans; an '<em>Amen</em> <em>chatufah</em>' (one that is too hasty) - his days [upon this earth] will be snatched from him; an '<em>Amen ketufah</em>'
    (an abbreviated <em>Amen</em>) - his days will be shortened. However, anyone who extends the recital of <em>Amen</em> - his days and years are lengthened"
    (<em>Berachot</em> 47a).
</p>
<p>
    The recital of <em>Amen</em> should be made in a pleasant tone and one's voice should not be raised above that of the <em>chazan</em> who is reciting the
blessing (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:12). One must not shorten the <em>Amen</em>, rather slightly elongate it for the amount of time it takes to say "<em>Kel Melech Ne'eman</em>," although it should not be overly extended. If there are people who do prolong their response of <em>Amen</em>, the<em>chazan</em> need not wait for them; instead, after most of the congregation has finished saying <em>Amen</em>, he may continue on to the next    <em>berachah</em>. However, regarding <em>berachot</em> with which the <em>chazan</em> fulfills the obligations of others, such as before the blowing of
    the <em>shofar</em>, the one reciting the blessing must wait until everyone finishes saying <em>Amen</em> so that those who extend their <em>Amen</em> can
    also hear the next <em>berachah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:8-9; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 38).
</p>
<p>
    Prominent <em>Rishonim</em> were accustomed to saying "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>" after the recital of Hashem's Name in the <em>berachah</em>, and
    their <em>minhag</em> became widespread throughout the nation of Israel. This applies to <em>berachot</em> concerning which one does not fulfill his
    obligation through someone else, such as the <em>Amidah</em> repetition for one who prays silently. However, concerning <em>berachot</em> whose obligation
    can be fulfilled through another person, such as the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Kiddush</em> and blowing<em> shofar</em>, the common custom is not to recite
    "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>," so as not to interrupt the <em>berachah</em> by reciting words not established by the <em>Chachamim</em>.
    Nevertheless, <em>b'dieved</em>, if one responded "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>" to a <em>berachah</em> that he was obligated to recite, he still
    fulfilled his obligation, since his response did not distract his mind from the <em>berachah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124: 21; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
    26).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
It is proper to enhance the mitzvah of listening to the <em>Chazarat</em> <em>HaShatz </em>by standing, just as the law requires for the silent    <em>Amidah</em>. This is because even the listeners who do not fulfill their obligation by hearing the repetition participate in its recital to a certain
extent and are considered as someone who recited an additional prayer. However, this is not an obligation, and one who wishes to sit is permitted (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124:20; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 24).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Must Nine Men Respond to <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>?
</h2>
<p>
When the <em>chazan</em> repeats the <em>Amidah</em>, each and every congregant must be silent, have <em>kavanah</em> to hear the <em>chazan</em>'s<em>berachot</em>, and answer <em>Amen</em> to them all. We have already mentioned the opinion (in the laws of the <em>minyan</em>, 2:7) that the<em>chazan</em> is prohibited from starting to recite the <em>Amidah</em> repetition until there are nine men who will respond <em>Amen</em> to his<em>berachot</em>. Others say that even if a few members of the <em>minyan</em> are still praying the <em>Amidah</em>, although they cannot answer    <em>Amen</em>, they are counted as part of the <em>minyan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
, it is customary for the <em>chazan</em> to be stringent and not start reciting the <em>Amidah</em> repetition until nine men are available to answer    <em>Amen</em> after him. In extenuating circumstances, when there are people who are in a rush to conclude the prayer service, and it seems that the person
    extending his <em>Amidah</em> is not about to finish, it is permissible to rely on the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> and start <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>
    when only eight people have concluded the <em>Amidah</em>. When this is impossible because there are a number of people prolonging their <em>Amidah</em>,
    if the situation is extremely mitigating, it is permissible to be lenient and begin the <em>Amidah</em> repetition when only five have finished praying,
for together with the <em>chazan</em> they comprise the majority of a <em>minyan</em>. In order to avoid uncertainty, if it is necessary to begin the    <em>Amidah</em> repetition when there are not yet nine people able to answer, the <em>chazan</em> makes a stipulation in his heart before praying. He
    stipulates that if the law follows those who maintain that there must be nine who answer, his prayer is voluntary (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>). Since a
    person is permitted to pray voluntarily, according to all opinions his <em>berachot</em> will not be in vain.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, one who is leading the prayer service in a place in which many people normally chatter, so much so that there is doubt as to whether will be
    nine men there to respond <em>Amen</em> to his <em>berachot</em>, he makes a stipulation in his heart before the repetition, that if the law follows those
    who maintain that there must be nine who answer, if there are not nine, his prayer is voluntary.
</p>
<p>
    In order not to enter into such uncertainty, every person who hears <em>Chazarat HaShatz </em>must presume that without him there are not nine men; he must
concentrate on the <em>chazan</em>'s <em>berachot</em> and respond <em>Amen</em> to them (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 124:4).    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. When Is the <em>Amidah</em> Repetition Not Recited?
</h2>
<p>
    Situations arise in which there is no time to pray a silent <em>Amidah</em> first and then recite an <em>Amidah</em> repetition. For example, sometimes a
    number of people must leave for work and without them there is no <em>minyan</em>. In such cases, the <em>Amidah</em> repetition is not recited. In order
    to ensure that their prayer will be in a <em>minyan</em>, everyone prays silently together. So as not to miss <em>Kedushah</em>, the <em>chazan</em> starts
    reciting the first three <em>berachot</em> aloud, the congregation responds to <em>Kedushah</em>, and the <em>chazan</em> and the congregation continue
    from <em>Birkat</em> <em>Attah Chonen</em> to pray the rest of the <em>Amidah</em> silently (<em>Rama</em> 124:2).
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, in a small <em>minyan</em>, in which some of the members greatly prolong their prayer and the others find it difficult to wait until they have
    finished, since they are rushed to be on their way, they are permitted to forgo <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>. Instead, the <em>chazan</em> recites the first
three <em>berachot</em> aloud in order to recite <em>Kedushah</em>. Although we learned that in extenuating circumstances it is permissible to recite    <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> while a few of the nine are still standing in prayer, nevertheless, <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is preferable not to enter into this
    uncertainty and to forgo the recital of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition altogether.
</p>
<p>
When there is a <em>minyan</em> whose members normally chatter and there is concern that there may not be nine men responding <em>Amen</em> to<em> </em>the    <em> chazan</em>, there is reason to consider canceling <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>. Perhaps it would be best to forgo its recital in order to reduce the
desecration of Hashem's Name caused by the talking during the <em>Amidah</em> repetition. Still, the prevalent <em>minhag</em> is not to cancel the<em>Amidah</em> repetition in a place that people normally chatter during the prayer service. All these laws must be decided by the local rabbi.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>chazan</em> begins reciting the first three <em>berachot</em> out loud, there are two customs as to when the congregation starts to recite the
    silent <em>Amidah</em>. Some are accustomed to start after the <em>chazan</em> finishes <em>Birkat</em> <em>HaKel HaKadosh</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    124:8), and others are accustomed to starting to pray along with the <em>chazan</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 124:10). It seems that it is best to recommend
starting to pray with the <em>chazan</em> in <em>Shacharit</em> so as not to pause in the middle of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Emet V'Yatziv</em>. In    <em>Minchah</em>, it is best that whoever normally prolongs his prayer starts to pray with the <em>chazan</em> so that he can conclude his prayer and
    respond to the <em>Kaddish</em> after it. Concerning a person who is used to praying quickly, it is best that he starts praying after the <em>chazan</em>
    concludes "<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>."<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
When <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> is not recited in <em>Shacharit</em>, and there are <em>Kohanim</em> present, in order not to lose out on    <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, it is best that the <em>Kohanim</em> wash their hands before praying and stand to recite the <em>Amidah</em> in the place in which
    they normally raise their hands to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. When the <em>chazan</em> reaches <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em>, he begins to pray
aloud again, so that the <em>Kohanim</em> can bless Israel after the conclusion of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Modim</em>. Whoever is reciting the same    <em>berachah</em> in his silent <em>Amidah</em> should respond <em>Amen</em> to it (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:71).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Kedushah
</h2>
<p>
In the third <em>berachah</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>, <em>Kedushah</em> is recited. The essence of the <em>Kedushah</em> is in the responses, "    <em>Kadosh</em>,<em> kadosh</em>,<em> kadosh</em>, <em>Hashem Tzevakot</em>,<em> melo kol ha'aretz kevodo</em>" ("Holy, holy, holy is Hashem, master of
    Hosts, the whole world is filled with His glory") and "<em>Baruch kevod Hashem mimkomo</em>" ("Blessed is the glory of Hashem from His place"). Originally,
it was customary for only the <em>chazan</em> to recite the connecting passages and the congregation would answer the verses, "<em>Kadosh</em>," "    <em>Baruch</em>," and "<em>Yimloch</em>" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 125:1). Nowadays, according to the <em>Arizal</em>, the congregation also recites the
connecting passages, the <em>chazan</em> repeats them aloud afterwards, and the congregation responds with the verses of the <em>Kedushah</em> (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 125:2; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 2).
</p>
<p>
    Some say that the verse "<em>Yimloch</em>" is not an essential part of <em>Kedushah</em>, but rather one of the <em>chazan</em>'s connecting passages, and
therefore, if a person is in the middle of reciting <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, and he hears <em>Kedushah</em>, he may only recite the verses "<em>Kadosh</em>" and "<em>Baruch</em>" and not the verse "<em>Yimloch</em>." Others say that he recites "<em>Yimloch</em>", since this verse is included in    <em>Kedushah</em> as well. This is the prevalent <em>minhag</em>.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Kedushah</em>
is recited a total of three times in <em>Shacharit</em>: in <em>Birkat Yotzer Or</em>, in <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, and in the passage    <em>U'va L'Tzion.</em> However, the <em>poskim</em> disagree as to whether the laws of the <em>Kedushah</em> in <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> apply to the
    other two, and whether it is necessary to recite them in a <em>minyan</em>. In practice, the halachic ruling is that an individual is permitted to recite
    them. However, to avoid uncertainty, it is best that he recite them in a melody of cantillation as if reading from the Torah (see further in this book
    16:4; 23:2). The <em>Kedushah</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> repetition is the essence of <em>Kedushah</em> and it is only recited with a <em>minyan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    It is proper to stand with one's feet together for <em>Kedushah</em>, since we recite this <em>Kedushah</em> like the angels whose legs are so close
    together that they resemble one leg (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 125:2). There are those who enhance the mitzvah by remaining with their legs together until
    the end of <em>Birkat</em> <em>HaKel HaKadosh</em> (<em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> 125:6). However, this is not an obligation and many prominent rabbinic
    authorities are not strict concerning this.
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to raise one's heels slightly when saying "<em>Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh</em>," "<em>Baruch</em>," and "<em>Yimloch</em>," and to turn one's
closed eyes upward, thereby expressing the desire to transcend physical boundaries and soar upward. The source for this resides in the <em>Midrash</em> (    <em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Rama</em> 125:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 6; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>, paragraphs 2 and 9).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. When Does the <em>Chazan</em> Recite the Verses of <em>Kedushah?</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>chazan</em> must recite the verses "<em>Kadosh</em>," "<em>Baruch</em>," and "<em>Yimloch</em>" together with the congregation, in order to say
    them with a <em>minyan</em>. He must also recite them out loud, so that if someone is in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>, he will be able to hear them,
    thereby fulfilling his obligation of <em>Kedushah</em>, for one who hears is like one who answers (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 104:7). After reciting the
    verses, he should be silent until the majority of the congregation concludes saying the connecting passages, and then he recites them aloud.
</p>
<p>
    If the <em>chazan</em>'s voice is not strong enough to be heard by the congregation, he should wait until most of the congregation finish reciting the
    verse, so that their voices fade slightly, and only then start to recite the verse. That way, on the one hand, everyone will be able to hear him, and on
    the other hand, since some have not finished reciting the verses of <em>Kedushah</em>, he is still considered to be reciting them in a <em>minyan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If the congregation is very large, so that the <em>chazan</em> can only make his voice heard after everyone has finished reciting the verse, there are
    various opinions as to how he should practice. Some maintain that it is crucial that he recites the verses of <em>Kedushah</em> with the congregation and
    tries to be heard by at least ten people. Others say that it is most important that everyone can hear him; he should not be concerned that he may not be
    reciting the verses with ten people. Since he is the <em>chazan</em>, when there is a <em>minyan</em> there that can hear him, he is, indeed, considered to
be saying them in a <em>minyan</em>. Therefore, he must wait until his voice can be heard by everyone. Both <em>minhagim</em> are valid.    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. <em>Modim D'Rabbanan</em> and Additional Laws
</h2>
<p>
    When the <em>chazan</em> reaches <em>Modim</em>, the whole congregation bows with him and recites <em>Modim d'Rabbanan</em>, whose <em>nusach</em> differs
    from that of the <em>Modim</em> in the <em>Amidah</em>, as clarified in the <em>Talmud</em> (<em>Sotah</em> 40a).
</p>
<p>
The entire congregation bows down in <em>Modim d'Rabbanan.</em> The laws concerning this bow are similar to the laws of <em>Modim</em> in the silent    <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 127:2; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 1; see earlier in this book 17:6).
</p>
<p>
There are those who say that it is necessary to bow again at the conclusion of <em>Modim d'Rabbanan.</em> Others say that it is proper to recite the full<em>Modim d'Rabbanan</em> while bowing. The prevalent <em>minhag</em> is to bow only in the beginning of <em>Modim d'Rabbanan</em>, as was the    <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Ari</em> (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em> 127:1; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 10).
</p>
<p>
    In a prayer service in which <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is recited, as in <em>Shacharit</em>, <em>Musaf</em>, and in the <em>Minchah</em> of fast days, if
there are no <em>Kohanim</em> present, the <em>chazan</em> recites the verses of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> as a prayer, and the congregation responds "    <em>Ken yehi ratzon</em>" to every verse.
</p>
<p>
    There are two versions of <em>Birkat HaShalom</em> - "<em>Sim Shalom</em>" and "<em>Shalom Rav</em>." According to <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, which follows
    the <em>Ari</em>, <em>Sim Shalom</em> is recited in all the prayers. According to <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, <em>Sim Shalom</em> is recited in a prayer in
    which <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> can be recited. In a prayer in which <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> cannot be recited, <em>Shalom Rav</em> is recited. If one
mistakenly said the wrong wording, he still fulfilled his obligation (<em>Rama</em> 127:2, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 24).    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
    If a <em>chazan</em> becomes disoriented to the point where he cannot continue praying, the congregation waits to see if he can return to his senses. If he
    cannot continue, another <em>chazan</em> is appointed to replace him. If this happens in one of the middle <em>berachot</em>, the second <em>chazan</em>
    starts from the beginning of that <em>berachah</em>. If it happens in the middle of the first three or the last three <em>berachot</em>, he starts from the
    beginning of those three <em>berachot</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 126:1-2).<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. Is It Possible to Make Up the <em>Amidah</em> Repetition?
</h2>
<p>
    Ten men who each prayed individually and later gather in one place do not have the status of a <em>minyan</em> and cannot recite <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>
    since they each already prayed as individuals (<em>Radbaz</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 69:1; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 1; <em>Barchu</em> is made up after the
    prayer service for those who came late, as clarified further in this book 23:9).
</p>
<p>
    However, if there is a person among them who did not yet pray, he may say Half-<em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em> after <em>Yishtabach.</em> When he
    reaches the <em>Amidah</em>, he recites the first three <em>berachot</em> aloud and the others then say <em>Kedushah</em> with him. That way, everyone is
    able to hear <em>Kaddish</em>, <em>Barchu</em>, and <em>Kedushah</em>. This law is called "<em>Pores al Shema</em>"<em> </em>("dividing the <em>Shema</em>
    "). Similarly, in <em>Minchah</em>, a person who did not yet pray may recite <em>Ashrei</em>, <em>Kaddish</em>, and then the <em>Amidah</em>, saying the
    first three <em>berachot</em> aloud.
</p>
<p>
The law concerning an individual who arrived late to prayer is similar. If there are nine people willing to answer <em>Amen</em> after him, when he reaches    <em>Yishtabach</em>, he may recite<em> Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em> and when he reaches the <em>Amidah</em>, he says the first three <em>berachot</em>
    out loud, thereby enabling the recital of <em>Kedushah</em>.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
    If six people have gathered to pray and another four who already prayed join them, the <em>chazan</em> may recite the entire prayer service. Since there
    are ten Jews there, and among them, a majority of a <em>minyan</em> who did not yet pray, they are considered a <em>minyan</em> and all the relevant laws
    apply.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p>
However, if there are only five that have not yet prayed, their law is like that of an individual. When they arrive at <em>Yishtabach</em> they recite    <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em>, and when they reach the <em>Amidah</em>, one of them recites the first three <em>berachot</em> out loud and
    subsequently they say <em>Kedushah</em> (see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 69 s.v. "<em>Omer</em>").

However, according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124:40, it is better that he repeats the prayer himself, for then he will have more            <em>kavanah</em>.

            Regarding the matter of supplementary prayers (<em>tashlumim</em>), see earlier in this book 18:8, note 9, where it is explained that concerning
            the supplementary <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Shacharit</em>, the majority of <em>poskim</em> agree that a person cannot fulfill his obligation by
            hearing the <em>chazan</em>'s repetition. Concerning the supplementary<em> Amidah </em>of <em>Ma'ariv</em>, however, there is disagreement.

            However, according to the <em>Chayei Adam</em> and <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 124:2, if he answered "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>," he did
            not fulfill his obligation. That is also what is written in <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, end of section 98. By contrast,
            according to <em>Rav Rakach</em> (<em>Luv</em>) one must answer "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>" even to a <em>berachah</em> in which he
            fulfills his obligation.

            The dispute of the <em>Acharonim</em> as to whether nine people are needed in order to respond to the <em>Amidah</em> repetition is clarified by
            the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 55:6-8 and 124:4, and in its commentaries. A summary is presented earlier in this book in the
laws of the <em>minyan</em>, chapter 2:7. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, we are stringent like the opinion of the <em>Graz</em> and the<em>Ben Ish Chai</em>. However, in extenuating circumstances we may be lenient, for that is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, among them            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 12:9 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 124:14-18. Even when a person who is in the middle of his <em>Amidah</em> is included as one
            of the <em>minyan</em>, there is disagreement as to whether up to four may be counted, or only one, as brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            55:32. Additionally, the advice to make a stipulation is brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124:19.

            The <em>Radbaz</em> (section <em>elef</em> 165) writes that the <em>Rambam</em> cancelled the silent prayer due to the people who chattered during
            the <em>Amidah</em> repetition. He instructed the <em>chazan</em> to recite the prayer aloud, and the well-versed to pray silently with him.
However <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is clearly proper to pray twice, as the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted. See <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 124:17 and            <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 3:16 who summarize the obligation to recite <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> and conclude that if there is concern that there will
            not be nine people to respond <em>Amen</em>, it is preferable not to recite <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> at all.

            The <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Ashkenazim</em> is that the congregation starts their <em>Amidah</em> after <em>Birkat</em> <em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>,
            and according to the Sephardic custom, the congregation starts along with the <em>chazan</em>. The basis for this difference is in how each custom
relates to the <em>berachah</em> of <em>Hakel HaKadosh</em>. The <em>poskim</em> disagree as to whether the halachah follows the<em>Yerushalmi</em>, which maintains that there is special virtue in answering <em>Amen</em> to the <em>berachot</em> <em>HaKel HaKadosh</em> and<em>Shome'a Tefillah.</em> According to the <em>Rama</em>, a person may respond to their recital even if he is in the middle of saying<em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, whereas according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 66:3 the law regarding them is like the laws concerning all other<em>berachot</em> to which we may not respond while in the middle of reciting <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. Therefore, according to the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, one starts his <em>Amidah</em> after <em>Birkat</em> <em>HaKel HaKadosh</em> so that he may respond <em>Amen</em>, and
            according to the <em>Sephardim</em>, there is no reason for this. This is clarified in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 109:1.
        </p>
        <p>
Even so, I have presented one approach for both <em>Sephardim</em> and <em>Ashkenazim</em> since there are numerous reasons why even<em>Ashkenazim</em> should start with the <em>chazan</em> in <em>Shacharit</em>: 1) <em>L'chatchilah</em>, it is best to abide by the ruling of the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> </em>which rules that one does not answer <em>Amen</em> to <em>HaKel HaKadosh</em> in the middle of            <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, and if he starts reciting the <em>Amidah</em> with the <em>chazan</em>, he avoids this uncertainty. 2) From the
            standpoint of prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, there is virtue in the fact that all ten start praying together as explained in this book, chapter 2,
note 2. 3) It is less complicated halachically to respond to <em>Kedushah</em> after <em>Birkat</em> <em>Mechayei Meitim</em> than in the middle of            <em>Birkat</em> <em>Emet V'Yatziv</em>. 4) It is possible that reciting the <em>Amidah</em> in a <em>minyan</em> together with the <em>chazan</em>
is considered as responding <em>Amen</em> (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 109:13-14). In <em>Minchah</em>, it is easier to recommend to<em>Ashkenazim</em> who normally extend their prayer that they should start with the <em>chazan</em> enabling them to respond to the<em>Kaddish</em> after the <em>Amidah</em>, for certainly its virtue is no less than the virtue of responding <em>Amen</em> to<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>. However, for those who shorten their prayer, even according to the<em> Sephardim</em> it is good that they start after<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>, so that they will merit answering <em>Amen</em> after the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, including<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>, which some say possesses special virtue. Another reason for this is so that they will not be idle upon finishing the            <em>Amidah</em>.

The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 125:1 mentions both opinions and in section 66:17 he writes that in practice one may not respond the verse<em>Yimloch</em> while in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, for that is the opinion of most <em>Acharonim</em>, and so rules the<em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 6:3. That is also the law concerning reciting this verse in the middle of the prayers of supplication after the            <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Elokai Netzor</em>), as explained in <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 122:4. However, <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 66:6 writes that this
            matter is left unresolved and one may do as he pleases. After bringing many <em>Acharonim</em> who maintain that <em>Yimloch</em> is not part of
            the main section of <em>Kedushah</em>, <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 66:18 (and section 122:1 and 124:17), writes that <em>Yimloch</em> is, indeed,
            considered part of the <em>Kedushah</em>, as can be inferred from <em>Sha'ar HaKavanot</em>. This issue also has halachic significance pertaining
to one who is in the middle of reciting the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, whether he must also be quiet during <em>Yimloch.</em> See            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 104:13.

            The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 125 s.v. "<em>Ela</em>" writes that if the <em>chazan</em> starts the verse before the congregation finishes saying
            it, he is considered to be reciting it in a <em>minyan</em>. However, if even then they will not hear him, the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> is
            uncertain as to whether the <em>chazan</em> may recite the verses after the congregation has finished, for perhaps because he is saying them in
            order to fulfill the obligation of the people listening, he need not say them with ten people, and it is enough that ten people hear him to be
            considered reciting them in a <em>minyan</em>. He leaves this matter unresolved.<em> Divrei Yosef</em> 13 writes that the <em>chazan</em> must say
            the verses with the congregation. However,<em> Beit Yehudah</em>,<em> </em>part 2, 3, writes that we are not strict that the <em>chazan</em> recite
            the verses with the congregation and that is also implied from<em> Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 3:4.
        </p>
        <p>
When a person is praying the <em>Amidah</em> and silently stops so as to hear the <em>chazan</em> recite the <em>Kedushah</em>, as explained in<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 104:7, yet does not succeed in hearing him, the <em>Levushei Mordechai</em>, part 1:17 writes that he should have<em>kavanah</em> to hear a congregant instead. However, many <em>poskim</em> maintain that since the people in the congregation do not have            <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill him in his obligation, this is not effective. Therefore, if he cannot hear the <em>chazan</em>, it is best that he
            continues praying the <em>Amidah</em>. So is written in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 104:36 and implied in the <em>Igrot Moshe </em>there.

            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>
127:2, s.v. "<em>Aval</em>" writes that if he remembers in the middle of the <em>berachah</em> that he began <em>Shalom Rav</em> in            <em>Shacharit</em>, he must go back and correct it as long as he did not finish the <em>berachah</em>, because the wording of <em>Shalom Rav</em>
is short and lacks some of the content mentioned in <em>Sim Shalom.</em> However, if in <em>Ma'ariv</em> someone realizes in the middle of the<em>berachah</em> that he mistakenly started <em>Sim Shalom</em> instead of <em>Shalom Rav</em>, he need not go back and correct it because            <em>Sim Shalom</em> includes the wording of <em>Shalom Rav</em>. The <em>Nusach</em> of most <em>Chassidim</em> is to recite <em>Sim Shalom</em>
            every day in <em>Minchah. </em>It seems that the reason for this is because on fast days <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is recited in <em>Minchah</em>,
since there is no concern of intoxication then. If so, we see that essentially, it is befitting to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim </em>in every            <em> Minchah</em> when there is no concern of intoxication; therefore, it is appropriate to recite <em>Sim Shalom.</em>

The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 126:3 writes that a <em>chazan</em> who forgot to recite <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> repetition on            <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> or <em>Chol HaMo'ed</em> does not repeat it. Although an individual must repeat his prayer following such a mistake,
            nevertheless, a <em>chazan</em> does not, since subsequently in <em>Musaf</em>, the specialness of the day is mentioned and therefore, so as not to
trouble the congregation, we do not compel him to repeat <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>. However, if he has not yet finished praying, he returns to            <em>Retzeh</em> in order to insert <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>, for that is not such a big bother to the congregation. A <em>chazan</em> who errs in
his silent <em>Amidah</em> does not need to repeat his prayer, since he fulfills his obligation in the <em>Amidah</em> repetition (            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 126:4).

            Some say that when this individual, to whom the congregation agrees to respond, finishes <em>Tachanun</em>, he says Half-<em>Kaddish</em>, and when
            he concludes <em>U'va L'Tzion</em>, he says <em>Kaddish</em>-<em>Titkabal</em>. So write <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 56:37 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em>
            34:4. The <em>Hagahot Ish Matzliach</em> on section 69 writes that some say that <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> is recited only when at least three
            people did not pray, and others say that it is only recited when six people who did not pray are present. Each community follows its own customs.
            As it seems, the prevalent <em>minhag</em> is to recite the <em>Kaddishim</em> after the <em>Amidah</em> only for six people who did not pray.
        </p>
        <p>
In principle, if the person who did not yet pray is unable to pray aloud, someone else may be <em>chazan</em> for him, say the <em>Kaddish</em> and            <em>Barchu</em> for him, and start the first three <em>berachot</em> of the <em>Amidah</em> out loud. Afterwards, that <em>chazan </em>who prayed
            for him must finish the rest of his prayer silently (see <em>Rama</em> 69 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 17).

            If six people start reciting the <em>Amidah</em> with the hope that four others will eventually join them, and indeed, after they conclude their
            silent prayer, four people who already prayed arrive and are willing to complete the <em>minyan</em>, according to the <em>Radbaz</em>, since when
            they prayed silently there was no <em>minyan</em>, they cannot recite the <em>Amidah</em> repetition. Many<em> poskim</em> maintain, however, that
            since they assembled in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, they hoped that people would arrive to complete their <em>minyan</em>, and they even
comprised most of a <em>minyan</em>, so they may recite <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>. So writes <em>Har Tzvi Orach Chaim</em> 1:51 and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 69:1.
