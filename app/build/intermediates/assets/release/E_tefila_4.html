    Chapter Four: The Chazan and the Mourner's Kaddish
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. An Appropriate Prayer Leader
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>chazan</em> leads the prayer service. Sometimes, the whole congregation says the prayers together with him while he sets the pace; other times, he
    recites the prayers and the congregation responds <em>Amen</em>, such as in <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> (repetition of the <em>Amidah</em>) and the recital
    of the <em>Kaddish</em> prayers. Hence, the <em>chazan</em> must be an upright, highly regarded, humble, amiable person, who has a pleasant voice and is
    accustomed to reading the Torah, <em>Nevi'im </em>(Prophets) and <em>Ketuvim</em> (Sacred Writings) (<em>Ta'anit</em> 16a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 53:4).
</p>
<p>
    We must be especially meticulous about this on the High Holy Days, and on fast days, when we pray to Hashem and beg Him to forgive us for our sins, save us
from our troubles, and bring our redemption closer. For if there is fault in the <em>chazan</em>, the congregation's prayer will not ascend properly (    <em>Rama</em> 581:1).
</p>
<p>
    During <em>Chazal</em>'s time, it was forbidden to write <em>siddurim</em> because only the written Torah<em> </em>(<em>Torah Shebichtav</em>) was
    permitted to be written down. Anything that was transmitted by word of mouth, including the prayers and blessings instituted by the <em>Chachamim</em>, was
    forbidden to be put into writing (<em>Temurah</em> 14b). At that time the <em>chazan</em>'s task was very important because all the prayers had to be
    recited aloud in order to fulfill the obligations of the congregation. Therefore, the congregation designated one <em>chazan</em> for this honorable task,
    and all the laws that apply to appointing the <em>chazan</em> on fast days also pertained to the regular <em>chazan</em>. <em>L'chatchilah</em>,<em> </em>
    each and every person in the congregation would have to agree to the <em>chazan</em>'s appointment, since he fulfilled everyone's obligation. However,
    today, when everyone has a <em>siddur</em>, the <em>chazan</em>'s job is less important and selecting a permanent <em>chazan</em> for the whole year is no
longer customary. Instead, every day a different person can lead the prayer service; therefore we are less meticulous in choosing a <em>chazan</em> (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 53:19; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 53:53).
</p>
<p>
    Even so, when appointing <em>chazanim</em>, the <em>gabba'im</em> (synagogue coordinators) must try to choose decent people who abide by the Torah and
    observe the <em>mitzvot. </em>They should be people whom the congregation agrees to have as its prayer leaders, for the <em>chazanim</em> are the ones who
    repeat the <em>Amidah</em> and recite the <em>Kaddish</em> prayers on its behalf (see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 53:86). Additionally, on Shabbat and festivals,
    when it is customary that the <em>chazanim</em> sing and chant part of the prayer service, the <em>chazanim</em> should be musically gifted with pleasant
    voices.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. <em>Chazanut</em> for the Sake of Heaven
</h2>
<p>
    While singing, the <em>chazanim</em> must have <em>kavanah</em> for the sake of Heaven, but if they prolong their <em>chazanut</em> (cantillation) and
    their only intention is to show off their beautiful voices, the Torah writes about them, "It raises its voice against Me, therefore I have hated it"
    (Jeremiah 12:8). They are using the holy prayer service to arrogantly boast as if on a stage. Even a person whose only intent is for the sake of Heaven
    should not excessively extend his cantillation so as not to burden the congregation (<em>Rashba</em>; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 53:11).
</p>
<p>
    While chanting the prayers, the <em>chazanim</em> are prohibited from repeating any words of the <em>berachot</em> and <em>Kaddish</em>, because doing so
    changes the <em>nusach</em> that the <em>Chachamim</em> established. If the repetition of the words alters the meaning of the <em>berachah</em>, those
    words are considered to be an interruption (<em>hefsek</em>) and the <em>chazan</em> must recite the <em>berachah</em> again from the beginning. However,
    if the meaning does not change, <em>b'dieved</em> he does not need to recite the <em>berachah </em>again, because he did not interrupt its recital with
    another matter (see <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 22; <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 7).
</p>
<p>
    One must be strict not to appoint a singer who is accustomed to singing indecent songs to be a regular <em>chazan,</em> or a <em>chazan</em> for the High
    Holy Days (<em>Rama </em>53:25).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether or not it is permitted to use melodies of offensive songs for prayers and liturgy. In practice, when the congregation
    is not familiar with the vulgar song's lyrics, it is customary to be lenient and adjust the melody to suit the prayer. But if the congregation recognizes
    the song, its tune may not be used for prayer, because when people sing it, they will be reminded of the crude theme of the song and their concentration is
    likely to be disrupted.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. Appointing a <em>Chazan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>chazan</em> is the emissary of the congregation, and therefore a person is prohibited from taking hold of the <em>chazanut</em> unless he is asked
    to do so by the congregation or by the <em>gabbai</em> as its representative. Hence, one may not respond <em>Amen</em> to a person who appointed himself to
    be <em>chazan</em> against the congregation's wishes (<em>Rama</em> 53:22).
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>gabbai</em> asks someone in the congregation to lead the prayer service, it is polite to initially decline, so as not to appear as one who
    desires to flaunt his voice. However, when the <em>gabbai</em> insists, he should prepare himself to ascend, but wait to see if there is another person
    more appropriate than he. If he is asked a third time, he should comply and begin to pray. However, if an important person asks him to ascend, he should
    accept immediately, for it is not proper to refuse a distinguished individual (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 53:16). Additionally, when the <em>gabbai</em> asks
    a person who declined in the previous prayer service to ascend, he should consider it a second request and ready himself to stand, but wait to see that
    there is no one more appropriate. If asked again, he should concur immediately.
</p>
<p>
    If a person is able to lead the prayer service but declines more than the <em>Chachamim</em> instructed, he offends the respect due to the prayer and to
    Heaven (<em>kevod Shamayim</em>). Likewise, a person whom Hashem endowed with a talent for singing and a pleasant voice should not decline on Shabbat and
    festivals since the prayers on those days are rich with song and melody. If he refuses to pray out of stubbornness or laziness, and does not praise Hashem
    with his voice, it would have been better for him not to have come into this world (<em>Sefer Chassidim</em> 768). The <em>Chachamim</em> said about Navot
the Israelite, who had an exceptionally pleasant voice, that he would ascend to the Temple in Jerusalem for the three pilgrimage festivals (    <em>shalosh</em> <em>regalim</em>) and all of Israel would gather to hear him. The one time he stayed home to guard his vineyard, he was punished - lawless
    people testified that he rebelled against the king and he was put to death (<em>Pesikta Rabbati</em> 25).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Indecent Attire and the Importance of a Beard
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> say (<em>Megillah</em> 24a) that a <em>poche'ach</em>, a person whose clothes do not cover his body in a respectable manner, may not
    read from the Torah nor lead the prayer service. Therefore, a person wearing a sleeveless shirt or shorts may not be appointed <em>chazan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If his sleeves are very short and do not reach near his elbow, he should cover his arms until his elbow with his <em>tallit</em>. However, one whose short
    sleeves almost reach his elbow may serve as <em>chazan</em>.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, the <em>Chachamim</em> state that a person whose beard is not yet full may not be appointed a regular <em>chazan</em>, since it is disrespectful
    towards the congregation and the prayer service to select someone who has not yet completely matured. However, on a temporary basis, even an adolescent
    whose beard has not yet started to grow may lead the prayer service.
</p>
<p>
    An eighteen year-old whose beard has started to grow slightly may be appointed a regular <em>chazan</em>. Similarly, appointing a twenty year-old whose
    beard has not yet sprouted is permissible, since it is clear to all that he is an adult and there is no disgrace to the congregation or to the prayer
    service (<em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 53:6-8).
</p>
<p>
    Based on this, some <em>Acharonim</em> write (<em>Pri Megadim</em>; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>) that a young boy who has lost one of his parents may not be a
    regular <em>chazan</em> for <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>, rather he should suffice with saying <em>Kaddish</em>. But for <em>Ma'ariv</em>, in
which there is no<em> Chazarat HaShatz</em>, even one whose beard has not yet grown in completely may lead the prayer service regularly.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>

<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Mourner's Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    A person mourning the death of one of his parents says <em>Kaddish</em> during the first year. Saying <em>Kaddish</em> is of great value to the deceased;
    it saves him from the judgment of <em>Gehinnom</em>, for since his son, whom he left behind in this world, is sanctifying God by reciting this prayer, his
    merits increase. One must say <em>Kaddish</em> even for completely righteous parents, as well as for someone who was killed for the sanctification of God's
    Name. Concerning righteous parents, though they are already promised life in the next world, their sons' <em>Kaddish</em> elevates their souls and causes
    them to be at peace. Certainly, one must recite <em>Kaddish</em> for evil parents since they are in great need of <em>Kaddish</em> which diminishes the
    judgment of <em>Gehinnom</em>. We even say <em>Kaddish</em> for someone who committed suicide. Although the <em>Chachamim</em> teach that we do not mourn
for him and he does not have a share in the next life, the <em>Kaddish</em> that his sons recite for him helps repair his soul slightly.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    If the son knows how to lead the services, he should be the <em>chazan</em> on weekdays, since this benefits the deceased even more. If it is difficult for
    him, he should try to lead the prayer service from <em>Ashrei</em> after <em>Tachanun</em> until the end of the service. It is especially good for him to
be the <em>chazan</em> for <em>Ma'ariv</em>, since at that time the judgments from <em>Gehinnom</em> intensify. This is particularly true on    <em>Motza'ei</em> <em>Shabbat</em>, when the souls return to <em>Gehinnom</em> after their respite during Shabbat. It is important to note that according
to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, on Shabbat and festivals, those in mourning say <em>Kaddish</em> but do not lead the services (<em>Rama</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah </em>376:4). Even on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and Chanukah, it is customary that the mourners do not lead the services.    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    This only applies when the son knows how to be the <em>chazan</em>, but if he does not know how to say the words properly, or his voice is unusual, or he
    excessively shortens or extends his prayer, it is preferable for him not to be the <em>chazan.</em> Rather, he should suffice with saying <em>Kaddish</em>.
    If he insists on being <em>chazan</em> against the wishes of the congregation, instead of sanctifying God's Name, he desecrates the Name of Heaven and
causes pain to the deceased. In general, mourners must know that despite the importance of serving as the <em>chazan</em> and the recital of    <em>Kaddish</em>, the most meaningful and beneficial acts children can do in order to aid the ascent of their dead parents' souls are to increase their
    Torah learning, their giving of charity, and their fulfillment of other <em>mitzvot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    There were certain communities in which, over time, more and more people did not know how to lead the prayer service, and therefore they established that
    mourners should not lead the services. However, for <em>Ma'ariv</em>, it is proper not to prevent mourners who are capable of being <em>chazanim</em> from
    leading the prayer service (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 53:61).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The Duration of the <em>Kaddish</em> Recital and the <em>Yahrtzeit</em> Day
</h2>
<p>
    According to Ashkenazic custom, a mourner leads the services and says <em>Kaddish</em> for eleven months after a parent's death. This is because the
    judgment of evil people in <em>Gehinnom</em> is twelve months, and if a mourner recites <em>Kaddish</em> for the deceased for a full twelve months, it will
    seem as though he was considered evil (<em>Rama</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah</em> 376:4). The Sephardic custom is to stop for the first week of the twelfth month
and then continue to lead the services and say <em>Kaddish</em> until the anniversary of the death (<em>yahrtzeit</em>) (<em>Birkei Yosef </em>there).<em>Kaddish</em> recited after learning, which is not within the framework of prayer, may be said by the mourners throughout the whole twelfth month (    <em>Rav Pe'alim</em>, part 4, <em>Yoreh De'ah</em> 32). However, for one who was known to be an evil person, such as someone who committed suicide or an
    apostate, <em>Kaddish</em> is recited for the full twelve months (<em>Pitchei Teshuvah</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah</em> 376:9).
</p>
<p>
    It is also customary to say <em>Kaddish</em> and lead the prayer service on the day of the <em>yahrtzeit</em>. According to Sephardic custom, one begins to
    say <em>Kaddish</em> from the Friday prior to the anniversary until the <em>yahrtzeit</em> day. Additionally, one who is well-liked by the congregation
    should also be <em>chazan</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:23). Even among <em>Ashkenazim</em> there are those who have the custom of leading the services on
    the Shabbat before the <em>yahrtzeit</em> and for the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer at the close of that Shabbat<em> </em>(<em>Pnei Baruch</em> 39:2). However,
they cannot preempt a mourner in his year of mourning or someone who has a <em>yahrtzeit</em> on that specific day (<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 132:26). The<em>yahrtzeit</em> is set according to the day the person died and not the day he or she was buried. Even at the end of the first year, the    <em>yahrtzeit</em> is established based on the day of the person's death.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Order of Precedence
</h2>
<p>
In the past, it was customary in Ashkenaz that only one person recited <em>Kaddish</em>. When there were several mourners who needed to say    <em>Kaddish</em>, it became necessary to establish an order of precedence. However, today most <em>Ashkenazim</em> and all <em>Sephardim</em> follow the
    custom that everyone who must say <em>Kaddish</em> recites it together. Even if the entire congregation recites <em>Kaddish</em> and there is no one there
    to answer <em>Amen</em>, that does not invalidate the <em>Kaddish</em>. However, <em>lechatchilah</em> it is preferable that there be at least two people
    there who can respond <em>Amen</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:31). When two or more people recite <em>Kaddish</em>, they should try to say it in unison and
should therefore stand next to each other. If the synagogue is large and it is difficult for them to gather in one place, each person may recite    <em>Kaddish</em> in his place and those around him answer <em>Amen</em>.
</p>
<p>
    When there are two mourners who know how to lead the prayer service and both are acceptable to the congregation, it is necessary to follow an order of
    precedence. This is the rule: one who is in the middle of the first seven days of mourning (<em>shivah</em>) takes precedence over one who is in his first
    thirty days (<em>sheloshim</em>), and someone who is in his first thirty days has priority over one who is in his year of mourning. One who is
    commemorating a <em>yahrtzeit</em> is equivalent to being in the first thirty days of mourning. If there are two mourners who are equal in status, they
    should divide the three daily prayers between them. They can even split the <em>Shacharit</em> service in such a way that one recites the main part of the
    prayer until after <em>Tachanun</em>, and the other leads from <em>Ashrei</em> until the conclusion of the prayer service, and then the following day they
    switch (<em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah</em> 132, <em>Ma'amar Kaddishin</em>).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. Saying <em>Kaddish</em> for a Person Who Does Not Have an Adult Son
</h2>
<p>
A minor whose mother or father died says <em>Kaddish</em> for his parent though he has not yet reached the age of <em>mitzvot</em> (bar mitzvah). Mourner's    <em>Kaddish</em> was instituted for that purpose, since a child cannot lead the prayer service in order to facilitate the ascent of his parent's soul.
    Therefore, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted <em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Rama</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah </em>376:4). Even if the minor has not yet reached the age of
    understanding, the <em>Kaddish</em> is read to him; the young orphan repeats the <em>Kaddish</em> word for word, and the congregation answers <em>Amen</em>
. (According to the <em>Ari</em>, it is important to be strict and have an adult say the Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em> with the minor, because that    <em>Kaddish</em> is included in the twelve <em>Kaddishim</em> that are necessary to hear every day. See further in this book 23:10.)
</p>
<p>
    In the case of a man or woman who was not privileged to leave behind a son, a God-fearing grandson may say <em>Kaddish</em> for him or her the whole year.
    This is possible even if the deceased has a son who is not God-fearing and does not go to synagogue to recite <em>Kaddish</em>. A grandson from a son takes
    precedence over a grandson from a daughter. If the deceased does not have a grandson yet, but has a son-in-law, the son-in-law should say <em>Kaddish</em>.
The grandson and son-in-law are permitted to say <em>Kaddish </em>only when one of their own parents is deceased, or if their parents agree to his reciting    <em>Kaddish</em> while they are living. However, someone whose parents are strict that he not say <em>Kaddish</em> while they are both alive may not recite
    the <em>Kaddish</em> for his grandparent or in-law.
</p>
<p>
    When the deceased does not have a son, grandson, or son-in-law, the father of the deceased recites the <em>Kaddish</em>. If his father is also dead, the
    brother or nephew says <em>Kaddish</em>.
</p>
<p>
When none of these relatives can say <em>Kaddish</em> for the deceased, part of the inheritance money should be used to hire a God-fearing person to recite    <em>Kaddish</em> for him. It is good to hire someone who is engrossed in Torah. If there is someone in the family who is occupied with Torah study, he
    takes precedence over a stranger. The monetary compensation for the <em>Kaddish</em> is important in order to ensure the fulfillment of its recital.
Furthermore, by employing someone who is involved in Torah or a poor person who has children to support, the deceased will acquire more merit.    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
If a minor who already reached the age of understanding passes away, his father must say <em>Kaddish</em> for him or her (<em>Pitchei Teshuvah</em>,    <em>Yoreh De'ah </em>376:3). There are those who have the custom to say <em>Kaddish</em> even for a small baby (see <em>Pnei Baruch</em> 34:30).
</p>
<p>
    One who hires himself out to recite <em>Kaddish</em> may do so for a number of people, on condition that he ends up saying at least one <em>Kaddish</em> a
    day for each of the deceased (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Yoreh De'ah</em>,<em> </em>part 1, 254, and see <em>Pnei Baruch</em> 34:23-28).
</p>
<p>
    It is proper for an adopted son to say <em>Kaddish</em> for his adoptive parents. All the more so, if the adoptive parent does not have another son, it is
    a mitzvah for the adopted son to say <em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 7, 23:13). It is also good for a righteous convert (<em>ger tzedek</em>)
    to say <em>Kaddish</em> for his gentile parents (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 7, 23:14, and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 132:20).

            <em>Yabia Omer</em>
            , part 6, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 7, summarizes that according to the <em>Ma'aseh Roke'ach</em> and <em>Rabbi Chaim Palaggi</em> , it is forbidden to
            use non-Jewish tunes for prayer. By contrast, <em>Maharam Lunzanu</em> and the <em>Birkei Yosef </em>(section 570) permit it, and this was done by
            many great Jewish leaders. That is also what the <em>Yabia Omer</em> rules in practice. Still, the <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13, 12 is stringent in
            this matter. Regarding melodies that were composed for the sake of idol worship, most <em>poskim</em> rule stringently (<em>Sefer Chassidim</em>
            238; <em>Bach</em>, old responsa 127). However, the responsa of <em>Krach shel Romi</em> is lenient and relays that there were prominent leaders
            who listened to Christian melodies and employed them even for the High Holy Days' prayers, but as mentioned, most <em>poskim</em> are stringent
            against this. See <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> there, who emerges strongly against his words. In summary, most <em>poskim</em> are of the opinion that if
            the secular vulgar songs are not familiar to the congregation, there is no prohibition against using their melodies. However, melodies of decent
            secular songs, although recognized, are permissible to use.

            <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
            <em>Rashi</em>
            interprets "<em>poche'ach</em>" as one whose thighs are showing. It is from here we learn that one's legs must be covered at least until the knee.
            I do not distinguish here between above the knee and below it, because today most people do not usually stand in front of important individuals
            with knee-length pants, and therefore the <em>chazan</em> is prohibited from wearing such pants. However, in <em>kibbutzim</em> or youth
            organizations, where the people regularly wear shorts even when they approach respected people, it is permissible for the <em>chazan</em> to wear
            pants that only reach the knee.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Concerning the upper limbs:</strong>
            The <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rambam</em>, and <em>Tur</em> maintain that a <em>poche'ach</em> is one whose shoulders are exposed. Therefore, if one wears
            a shirt with very short sleeves yet his shoulders are covered, he may be appointed <em>chazan</em>. That is how the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 53:39
            rules. However, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 53:13 rules based on the <em>Itur</em>, and so rules the <em>Bach</em>, that even if one's arms are
            showing, he is considered a <em>poche'ach</em>. According to this, the <em>chazan</em> must be wearing sleeves that reach his elbow. However, it
            seems that even according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> it is not necessary to measure exactly, but near the elbow is also considered until the
            elbow itself. There are those who are stringent that the <em>chazan</em> must wear long sleeves because it is accepted and modest to go before
prominent people in that manner (<em>Yaskil Avdi</em>, part 7, p. 329). Nevertheless, since the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rambam</em>, and most            <em>poskim</em> are completely lenient regarding arms, one may be lenient and permit sleeves that reach close to the elbow. Those who seek to
            glorify the mitzvah cover their entire arm with a long sleeve. My rabbi and teacher, HaRav Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook, would meticulously insist
            that the <em>chazanim</em> wore long sleeves.

            <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
            In <em>Chullin</em> 24b it is written, "Once a person's beard has filled in he is fit to become an emissary of the community and descend before the
            ark." The <em>Tosafot</em> ask: but didn't we learn in <em>Megillah</em> 24a that even a 13-year-old boy may descend before the ark? They answer
that he may be a <em>chazan</em> temporarily, but not on a regular basis, nor for fast days. That is also the opinion of most of the<em>Rishonim</em>. However, the <em>Ramban</em> and the <em>Ran</em> maintain that one whose beard has not yet filled in may not serve as            <em>chazan</em> even temporarily, and only if no one else there can lead, a 13-year-old may be appointed. Additionally, although one who shaves is
            considered someone whose beard has filled in, my rabbi and teacher, Rav Tzvi Yehudah Kook, was accustomed to enhance the mitzvah by only appointing
            a fully bearded person to be <em>chazan</em>. (Perhaps in doing so he also intended to encourage the yeshiva boys to grow beards of their own).
        </p>
        <p>
Concerning a young boy who is mourning the death of one of his parents, the <em>Pri Megadim</em> and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 53:6 s.v. "<em>Yuchal</em>," write that he may not be a regular <em>chazan</em>. <em>Shut</em> <em>Shivat Tzion</em> 18 writes that where he lived the            <em>minhag</em> was not to be strict about this. Instead they let the mourning youths lead the services throughout the whole year, since the
            congregation relinquishes its honor. However, it should be noted that only according to the <em>Rambam</em> a congregation can relinquish its
            honor, but according to the <em>Rosh</em>, a congregation does not have the authority to do so (because there is also the matter of the respect of
            Heaven, <em>kevod Shamayim</em>). Furthermore, the <em>Acharonim</em> discuss the case of a yeshiva of young adults. <em>Beit Baruch</em> 29:45
maintains that because all of them are young, they surely relinquish their honor. Again, his words are justified based solely on the opinion of the            <em>Rambam</em>. Moreover, if there are 15 and 16-year-olds present, there are almost always some there whose beards have filled in. Since this is
            a matter of uncertainty, the rabbi of the yeshiva must determine what is best according to the situation at hand.

            The <em>Magen Avraham</em>, brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 53:25, writes that it is not necessary to testify whether or not a 13-year-old
has two hairs, for we rely on the presumption (<em>chazakah</em>) that he has. However, the <em>Pri Megadim</em> writes that according to the<em>Rambam</em>, who maintains that prayer is a biblical commandment, testimony is necessary. Nevertheless, it seems that since today the            <em>chazan</em> does not fulfill a person's obligation to pray for him, all <em>poskim</em> agree that testimony is unnecessary.

            [4] In <em>Masechet Sofrim</em>, chapter 19, it is written that people in mourning say <em>Kaddish</em>. <em>Or Zarua</em>, part 2, end of section
            50, brings a story about a dead person who suffered greatly because of the sins he committed while he was alive. Rabbi Akiva saw him and wanted to
            save him from his suffering. He found out that he had a son who was completely uneducated, so Rabbi Akiva put great effort into teaching him until
            he could say <em>Kaddish</em> for his father. Afterwards, the dead person appeared to Rabbi Akiva and said to him, "Rabbi, let your mind be at ease
            in the Garden of Eden just like you put my mind to rest and saved me from the judgment of <em>Gehinnom</em>." Here we see that the <em>Kaddish</em>
            indeed helps evil people (<em>Beit Yosef</em>, <em>Yoreh De'ah</em> 376). The <em>Chatam Sofer</em> (<em>Even HaEzer</em>, end of section 69),
            writes that a person who commits suicide does not have a share in the World to Come, but can be saved from the judgment of <em>Gehinnom</em>
            through prayer, in the same manner that David prayed for his son Avshalom (See <em>Yabia Omer</em> part 6, <em>Yoreh De'ah </em>36). On a parallel
            but distinct note, the <em>Maharil</em> (responsa 96) writes that <em>Kaddish</em> is said for righteous people as well.

        <p>
            One who needs to say <em>Kaddish</em> but arrives late to pray: if the congregation finished the <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> (Psalm of the Day) while he
            is still in the middle of saying <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, he may interrupt to recite Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em>, if there will not be another
            chance to say it. However, for <em>Kaddish</em> <em>d'Rabbanan</em> one may not interrupt (<em>Maharshag</em> 1:48; <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 7,
            10).

            [5] The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> section 132 writes that on days that we do not say <em>Lamenatze'ach</em>, mourners do not lead the prayer service
(<em>Maharil</em> 22). By contrast, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes in section 581:7 that on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> a mourner may lead the<em>Shacharit</em>, <em>Minchah</em>, and <em>Ma'ariv</em> services, but for <em>Hallel</em> and <em>Musaf</em>, someone else should be the            <em>chazan</em>. However, he wrote regarding Chanukah in section 683:1, that a mourner should not lead the <em>Shacharit</em> service. There are
            those who have the custom that even on Tu B'av, Tu Bishvat, Purim Katan, and Lag BaOmer, mourners do not serve as <em>chazan</em>, but the
            widespread <em>minhag</em> is what I wrote above.

            Whereas for mourning purposes the day of the burial starts the count of the seven days of <em>shivah</em>, the 30 days (<em>sheloshim</em>), and
            the 12 months of mourning, the <em>yahrtzeit</em> is always the date on which the person died. There are those who have the custom to commemorate
            the first <em>yahrtzeit</em> on the burial date. However, the primary <em>minhag</em> is to commemorate it on the date of the person's death even
            that first year, as brought by <em>Pnei Baruch</em> 39:35 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, chapter 7, 22:3. <strong>In a leap year</strong>, according to
            the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>Orach Chaim</em> 568:7), the <em>yahrtzeit</em> is in Adar II, and according to the <em>Rama</em> it is in Adar I.
            When a person dies on the first day of <em>Rosh Chodesh </em>Adar II, which is the 30th of Adar I, in a non-leap year, the <em>yahrtzeit</em> falls
            out on the first day of <em>Rosh Chodesh </em>Adar, which is the 30th of Shevat (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 568:42, and see <em>Pnei Baruch</em>
            39:36-37). For the remaining <em>halachot</em> regarding the recital of <em>Kaddish</em>, see <em>Pnei Baruch</em> 34 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>,
            part 7, 23.

            Even when the deceased has a daughter, a man should be hired to say <em>Kaddish.</em> However, throughout the generations, there were places where
            the daughter would say <em>Kaddish</em>, either in her home or in the room adjacent to the synagogue, if there were no living son. Additionally,
            there are those who ruled that if the daughter is younger than 12 years of age, she should recite <em>Kaddish</em> in the synagogue. Nevertheless,
            the accepted <em>minhag</em> (custom) is that women do not say <em>Kaddish</em>. The <em>Chavot Yair</em>, responsa 222 states that we must object
to women saying <em>Kaddish</em> so as not to undermine the power of <em>minhagim</em>, as also written in <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 7, 23:11,            <em>Pnei Baruch</em> 34:20, and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 132:33.
