    Chapter Fifteen: <em>Keriat Shema</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Mitzvah of <em>Keriat Shema </em>(The Recital of <em>Shema</em>)
</h2>
<p>
    It is a positive biblical commandment to recite <em>Shema</em> at night and in the morning, as it is written (Deuteronomy 6:7), "And you shall say them...
    when you lie down and when you get up." "When you lie down" denotes nighttime, and "when you get up" refers to morning.
</p>
<p>
    We read three paragraphs, the first: "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" ("Hear O Israel") (Deuteronomy 6:4-9), with which we accept the yoke of Heaven, and which
    discusses the unity and love of Hashem. The second is "<em>V'hayah Im Shamo'a</em>" ("And if you follow") (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), which includes the
acceptance of the yoke of the <em>mitzvot</em>. The third is "<em>Vayomer</em>" ("And He said") (Numbers 15:37-41), including a command to remember the    <em>mitzvot</em> through the commandment of <em>tzitzit</em>, and mention of the Exodus from Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    The<em> Chachamim</em> arranged the <em>Shema</em> paragraph to precede <em>V'hayah Im Shamo'a</em> so that a person will first accept the yoke of Heaven,
and only afterwards accept the yoke of the <em>mitzvot</em>. They also placed <em>V'hayah Im Shamo'a</em> which involves a general mandate to keep all the<em>mitzvot</em>, including those performed during both day and night, before the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph, which discusses the mitzvah of    <em>tzitzit</em>, performed only during the day (<em>Berachot</em> 13a).
</p>
<p>
    In the opinion of some <em>Rishonim</em>, the biblical commandment is just to recite the verse "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>." According to them, this is the
meaning of (Deuteronomy 6:6-7), "These words I am commanding you today must be in your heart...when you lie down and when you get up." However, the    <em>Chachamim</em> instituted reciting the entire three paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
    It can be explained, that the essence of the mitzvah of <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> is indeed that a person accepts upon himself the yoke of Heaven, and
    for that reason, even one who only recites the first verse fulfills the biblical commandment. Yet, the more a person enhances his acceptance of the yoke of
    Heaven, the more completely he fulfills the biblical commandment. Therefore, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of all three paragraphs, for
    within them are the fundamentals of faith, the acceptance of the yoke of the <em>mitzvot</em>, and the remembrance of all the <em>mitzvot</em> through the
mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em>. Hence, in actuality, we fulfill the biblical mitzvah by reciting all three paragraphs.    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. Remembering the Exodus
</h2>
<p>
    It is a biblical commandment to remember the Exodus every day, as it says (Deuteronomy 16:3), "Therefore you will remember the day you left Egypt all the
    days of your life." The <em>Chachamim</em> learn from the word "all" (<em>kol</em>) that the mitzvah to remember the Exodus is performed both during the
    day and at night (<em>Berachot</em> 12b). This mitzvah can be fulfilled by reciting any verse that discusses leaving Egypt, or by mentioning the Exodus in
    one's own words.
</p>
<p>
    The<em> Chachamim</em> instituted reciting the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph in order to fulfill the mitzvah of remembering the Exodus from Egypt. Therefore,
    there are two reasons why <em>Vayomer</em> was incorporated into the recital of the <em>Shema</em>. First, it mentions the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em> that
    reminds us of all the <em>mitzvot</em>. Second, it talks about the Exodus from Egypt. It is therefore customary to say <em>Vayomer</em> even at night, for
although there is no need to mention the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em> then, we say it to remember the Exodus (see <em>Berachot</em> 14b, and    <em>Kesef Mishneh</em>, <em>Hilchot Keriat Shema</em>, chapter 1: 2-3).
</p>
<p>
There is a difference between the mitzvah of <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> and the mitzvah of remembering the Exodus from Egypt. The mitzvah of    <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> can only be fulfilled within the first three hours of the day because that is the time we wake up, whereas the daytime
    mitzvah of remembering the Exodus can be performed throughout the entire day. However, following the enactment of the <em>Chachamim</em>, we fulfill the
    mitzvah of remembering the Exodus with the recital of <em>Shema</em>, and if the time to say <em>Shema</em> has passed, a person can remember the Exodus
from Egypt by reciting the <em>berachah</em> of "<em>Emet V'Yatziv</em>." If four hours have passed, one may fulfill the mitzvah by saying the    <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph or by remembering the Exodus in another way (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 58:27, 67:3; see earlier in this book 11:11; and see the
    laws of <em>Ma'ariv</em>,<em> </em>further in this book chapter<em> </em>25, end of note 3).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. The Content of the <em>Shema</em> Paragraph
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Shema</em> paragraph (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) consists of three sections: 1) the foundation of faith, 2) the meaning of this foundation in our lives,
    and 3) instructions on how to instill faith into our lives.
</p>
<p>
    1) From the first verse, "Hear O Israel, Hashem is our God, Hashem is One," we learn the foundation of the unifying belief of Israel, that Hashem Blessed
    Be He is the Master of everything, and there is no force in this world other than He. Even though it may seem to us that there are other distinct powers,
    separate from one another, Hashem, Who is One, sustains all life, and there is no one else.
</p>
<p>
    2) The significance of this belief in our lives is that there is no other value in this world aside from the devotion to Hashem Blessed Be He. Hence, "Love
    Hashem your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might." The <em>Chachamim</em> (<em>Berachot</em> 54a) interpret these words:
    "With all your heart" - with both your inclinations: your good inclination (<em>yetzer hatov</em>) and your evil inclination (<em>yetzer hara</em>), -
    because one's evil inclination must also be controlled to serve Hashem, whether by force or by transforming it into good. "And with all your soul" - even
    if it takes your life, for a person must be ready to give his life for his belief in Hashem. "And with all your might" - with all your resources; even a
    person's money should serve as a basis and a means to serve Hashem, so that if it were demanded of a Jew to violate his religion or lose all his wealth, he
    would forfeit his money rather than defy his belief. Additionally, they interpret, "With all your might" - for each and every measure that Hashem bestows
    upon you, be grateful to Him very very much."
</p>
<p>
    3) In the third section, the Torah instructs us regarding how to instill these foundations of belief in ourselves. First, "Put these words that I am
    commanding you today into your heart" and additionally, "Teach them to your sons." Even after a person learns the basic tenets of faith very well, if he
    does not repeat them to himself every day, life's dealings and worries can cause him to forget them. Therefore we are commanded, "And say them when you sit
    in your house, when you walk on your way, when you lie down and when you rise up." From this we learn the obligation to recite <em>Shema</em> both in the
    morning and at night. Nevertheless, the Torah does not suffice with its recital alone, but rather adds the commandment to place these paragraphs of belief
    into our <em>tefillin</em> and to bind them on our arms and heads, as it is written, "And you shall bind them as a sign on your arm and they should be as
    frontlets between your eyes." We are also commanded to fix them firmly in the <em>mezuzot</em> on our doorposts, as it is written, "And write them on your
    doorposts of your houses and your gates." This is so that every time we enter and exit our houses, we look at the <em>mezuzah</em> and are reminded again
of the foundations of Israel's faith. Thus, the paragraph that discusses belief and the oneness of the Creator constantly guides us, in our hearts with    <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, on our bodies through <em>tefillin</em>, and on our property, meaning our houses, via the <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. The Second and Third Paragraphs
</h2>
<p>
    In the second paragraph, "<em>V'hayah Im Shamo'a</em>" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), we learn about the value of the <em>mitzvot</em>, the reward for those who
    fulfill them, and the punishment for those who transgress them. If we love Hashem, serve Him with all our hearts, and fulfill all His <em>mitzvot</em>, we
    will be worthy of His blessing. The land will bring forth its crops, and we will live long lives, we and our children, on the land that Hashem promised to
    give to our ancestors and to us. However, if we, God forbid, stray from the path, Hashem will be angry with us, the ground will not yield its produce, and
    we will be exiled from upon the good land. We are then told to put <em>tefillin</em> on our arms and heads, and to post <em>mezuzot</em> on the entrances
to our houses, thereby commanding us to deeply internalize these fundamentals of our faith not only by reciting <em>Shema</em> but by fulfilling other    <em>mitzvot</em> as well. In the first paragraph, the emphasis is on our appeal towards the heavens, by dedicating all our powers to serving Him. In the
    second paragraph, the emphasis is on revealing Hashem's autonomous rule in the world. The fulfillment of the <em>mitzvot</em> is an expression of the
    revelation of Hashem's will in this world. Reward and punishment also confirm His supervision over this world.
</p>
<p>
In the third paragraph, "<em>Vayomer</em>" (Numbers 15:37-41), the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em> is elucidated. This commandment possesses special merit, for    <em>tzitzit</em> have the power to remind us of all the <em>mitzvot</em> and to inspire us to fulfill them, as it says, "And you shall remember all of
    Hashem's <em>mitzvot</em> and you shall perform them." As an indication of that, the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em> can only be performed during the day and
    not at night because the day reminds us of the clear revelation of Hashem's word in the world. By revealing the light of the <em>mitzvot</em> and
    remembering them, we have the strength to overcome our evil inclination, as it says, "And you shall not seek after your heart and your eyes after which you
go astray." The conclusion of the paragraph tells of the Exodus from Egypt, which we are commanded to remember both day and night. Just like    <em>tzitzit</em>, which reveal the light of all the <em>mitzvot</em>, so too, the Exodus proved to us that there is a Leader in this world, and that the
    nation of Israel was chosen to reveal His word.
</p>
<p>
Thus, each of the three paragraphs is a continuation of and an expansion on the foundation of faith introduced by the verse "    <em>Shema Yisrael<strong> </strong>Hashem Elokeinu<strong> </strong>Hashem Echad</em>." In the first paragraph, we learn the fundamental significance of
    belief, which is the one and only foundation of our lives. This is an extension of the words "<strong><em>Hashem Echad</em></strong>," ("Hashem is One").
From that, we accept upon ourselves the yoke of all the <em>mitzvot</em> in the second paragraph, which parallels the words "<strong><em>Hashem Elokeinu</em></strong>," ("Hashem our God"). In the third paragraph, the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em> appears and proclaims to us all the    <em>mitzvot</em> and reminds us of them. At the end of the paragraph, the Exodus from Egypt, which showed the world that Hashem chose Israel and that He is
    the overseer and ruler of His world, is an expression of the words, "<strong><em>Shema</em> <em>Yisrael</em></strong>," ("Hear O Israel"). Thus the meaning
    of the <em>Shema</em> is capsulated in the very first verse, and explained in the paragraphs which follow. In the laws of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>
    16:1, we will learn that the <em>berachot</em> that the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted are also a continuation of and a supplement to the <em>Shema</em>
    prayer.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Significance of the Exodus
</h2>
<p>
    The Egyptian kingdom, which enslaved Israel, was essentially the kingdom of materialism. Historical research verifies this. Among all the ancient nations,
    no culture was more materialistic than the Egyptian culture. The Egyptians denied the existence of a soul and did not believe in the afterlife. Only the
    human body and material objects were of importance to them. They therefore invested enormous effort into mummifying their dead and preserving their bodies.
    Even the great pyramids are none other than tombs for their bodies. Their immoral culture worked in conjunction with their beliefs, the main purpose being
    to satisfy bodily urges. As <em>Chazal</em> tell us, no other country was more absorbed in lusts than Egypt (<em>Torat Kohanim</em>, <em>Acharei Mot</em>,
    chapter 9). The nation of Israel represents the exact opposite, its main objective being spiritual aspirations.
</p>
<p>
    The materialistic Egyptian nation ruled over <em>Am Yisrael</em> and enslaved the Jewish people in excruciating physical labor. It seemed that the great
    spirit that began to appear with our forefathers would not rise again. The material had prevailed over the spiritual, until the King of Kings Himself
    appeared in His glory and freed us from Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    By taking us out of Egypt, Hashem proved to the world, for the first time, the ultimate power of spirituality and moral values. The Exodus illustrates the
    victory of spirituality over materialism. As much as materialism tries to enslave spirituality, in the end, spirituality will free itself from its chains.
    Just like Israel left Egypt triumphantly and in great wealth, so will every battle between the spiritual and the material ultimately end victoriously for
    spirituality.
</p>
<p>
    And just as the nation of Israel, who gave the world Torah and ethics, was freed from the material bondage of the Egyptian empire, so too, each individual
of Israel must free himself from the chains of materialism in order to discover spirituality and to connect to the Master of the world by performing    <em>mitzvot</em>. Therefore, we are commanded to remember the Exodus every day and every night. In doing so, we recall Israel's great moral and spiritual
    calling, thereby freeing ourselves from the chains of materialism to embrace eternal Divine truths.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. <em>Kavanah</em> While Reciting the First Verse
</h2>
<p>
    One must have upmost <em>kavanah</em> while reciting the first verse of the <em>Shema</em>, in accepting the yoke of Heaven, as it is written (Deuteronomy
    6:6), "Put these words... <strong>in your heart</strong>." Therefore, a person must concentrate in his heart on the words he is saying while reciting the
    first verse. If he did not concentrate on the words he recited, he did not fulfill his obligation (<em>Berachot</em> 13b; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, 60:5,
    63:4).
</p>
<p>
    Even a person who concentrates on the full meaning of every word with <em>kavanah</em> must try not to let his mind wander to other thoughts in the middle
of the verse. However, <em>b'dieved</em>, as long as he was also thinking of the meaning of the words, he fulfilled his obligation.    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    Thus, when saying "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>," it is proper to reflect upon how the mitzvah of accepting the yoke of Heaven is destined for Israel, a nation
    that was created in order to reveal the belief in the unity of Hashem in the world. The word "<em>Hashem</em>," which is not read as it is written, is
    spelled, "<em>yud</em>" "<em>heh</em>" "<em>vav</em>" "<em>heh</em>" and pronounced "<em>A-donai</em>." While saying it, one should have in mind the way it
is pronounced, that Hashem is the Master (<em>Adon</em>) of everything, and concentrate on the way it is written, that He was, is, and will be (    <em>Hayah</em>, <em>Hoveh</em>, <em>V'yihiyeh</em>). In reciting the word "<em>Elokeinu</em>," one should know that God is firm and omnipotent, Master of
    all existing powers, and that He rules over us (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 5:1). When a person says "<em>Echad</em>," it should be with the <em>kavanah</em>
    that Hashem is the only ruler of the world, in the heavens and the earth, and the four directions of the world. This meaning is implied in the letters of
    the word "<em>Echad</em>": "<em>Alef</em>" - that He is One, "<em>Chet</em>"<em> </em>-<em> </em>signifying the seven heavens in addition to the earth, and
    "<em>Dalet</em>"<em> </em>- representing the four directions. One must extend the pronunciation of the letter <em>dalet</em> as long as it takes for him to
    think of the fact that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> is One in His world and that He rules in the four directions of the world (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 61:6;
    and see <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>18).
</p>
<p>
    <em>b'dieved</em>
    , even if a person did not have in mind the exact meaning of the Name of Hashem and each and every word, but he understood their overall significance - the
    acceptance of the yoke of Heaven - he fulfilled his obligation.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    However, if his mind wandered and he did not concentrate on even the general meaning of the words - the acceptance of the yoke of Heaven - then he did not
    fulfill his obligation, and he must repeat the words and recite them with their meaning in mind. If he remembers this immediately upon finishing the first
    verse, he must wait a bit, so as not to be seen as one who is reciting <em>Shema</em> twice, and then repeat the first verse quietly. If he remembers in
    the middle of the first paragraph, he must stop, start from the beginning of the first paragraph, and recite the whole passage in order. If he remembers in
    the middle of the second paragraph, he finishes that paragraph, after that goes back and repeats the entire first paragraph, and then skips to the third
paragraph, <em>Vayomer</em>. He need not repeat the second paragraph because he already had the appropriate <em>kavanah</em> while saying it and    <em>b'dieved</em>, the order of the paragraphs does not prevent him from fulfilling his obligation (<em>Mishnah Berurah </em>63:14; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
    17-18).
</p>
<p>
    In order to arouse <em>kavanah</em>, it is customary to read the first verse out loud and to cover one's eyes with his right hand so as not to look at
    anything else that might interfere with his concentration (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 61:4-5; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 17).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. The Second Verse and Its <em>Kavanah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Immediately following the first verse, we say quietly, "<em>Baruch shem kevod malchuto l'olam va'ed</em>," ("Blessed is the name of His glorious kingdom
    for all eternity"). Although this sentence does not appear with the <em>Shema</em> paragraph and is not a verse from the Torah, the <em>Chachamim</em>
    instituted its recital as part of <em>Shema</em> based on ancient tradition.
</p>
<p>
    It is told in the Talmud (<em>Pesachim</em> 56a) that before Yaakov Avinu died, all of his children gathered around him. Yaakov wished to reveal the end of
    days, but at that moment the <em>Shechinah</em> left him and he could not show them the future. He asked his sons, "Perhaps one of you is not righteous,
    like Yishmael, who came from Avraham, and Eisav, who came from my father Yitzchak, and that is preventing me from revealing to you the end of days?"
    Everyone opened their mouths and said, "'Hear O Israel, Hashem is our God, Hashem is One.' Just like there is only One in your heart, there is only One in
    our hearts." At that moment, Yaakov said, "Blessed is the name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity." <em>Chazal</em> ask, "Now what should we do?
    Should we recite this sentence [in <em>Shema</em>] even though it is not written in the Torah portion? Or should we refrain from saying it even though
    Yaakov Avinu said it?" Therefore, they established to recite it quietly.
</p>
<p>
This sentence is considered to be a continuation of the acceptance of the yoke of Heaven found in the first verse, and therefore also requires<em>kavanah</em> on the meaning of the words. If a person recites it without the proper <em>kavanah</em> he must go back and repeat it with the proper    <em>kavanah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 63:12).<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    One should pause briefly between "<em>l'olam va'ed</em>" ("for all eternity") and "<em>V'ahavta</em>" ("You shall love") in order to distinguish between
    the acceptance of the yoke of Heaven and the rest of the paragraph. Also, it is proper to pause between the first verse and "<em>Baruch shem</em>"
("Blessed be the name...") to differentiate between the acceptance of the yoke of Heaven as commanded by the Torah and the enactment of the    <em>Chachamim</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em> 61:14).<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
Although the belief in the oneness of God holds unfathomable depths and meanings, we will nonetheless briefly discuss its significance. The first verse,    <em>Shema</em> <em>Yisrael</em>, expresses the absolute and unifying higher belief and is called "<em>yichud elyon</em>" (the supernal unification). In
    this realm of higher understanding, nothing else substantially exists in the world besides Hashem. He is One in His world, and we are all insignificant in
    relation to Him. Since Hashem's infinite power is not visible to us, it is difficult to grasp the supernal union permanently. Therefore, only twice daily,
    when we recite the verse <em>Shema</em> <em>Yisrael</em>, are we commanded to rise to its level. The second verse is called "<em>yichud tachton</em>" (the
    lower unification), and by saying it, we accept upon ourselves the yoke of Heaven according to the belief that is revealed in this world. This is the
    belief that the world is not void, rather tangible and existent, and Hashem Blessed Be He gives it life and rules over it. By His will He creates life, or
God forbid, takes it away. In so doing, His Name and kingdom are revealed in the world, as we say, "Blessed is the <strong>name</strong> of His glorious    <strong>kingdom</strong> for all eternity" (<em>Tanya, Sha'ar HaYichud V'HaEmunah, </em>and<em> Nefesh HaChaim</em>,<em> Sha'ar</em> 3).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. Mitzvot Require Kavanah
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Amora'im</em> and the <em>Rishonim</em> disagree regarding the question, do <em>mitzvot</em> require <em>kavanah</em>? When the Torah commands us
    to perform a certain mitzvah, is the actual performance enough, or must a person have in mind the correct intent in order to fulfill the commandment? The
halachah rules that <em>mitzvot</em> require <em>kavanah</em>. Just as a person has a body and a soul and one cannot live without the other, so too, the    <em>mitzvot</em> need both body and soul, the body being the act of the mitzvah, and the soul being the <em>kavanah</em> that accompanies it.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, regarding a person who is reading the Torah portion of <em>Parashat</em> <em>Va'etchanan</em>, in which the <em>Shema</em> paragraph is written:
    when the time to recite <em>Shema</em> arrives, if he has <em>kavanah</em> in his heart to fulfill the mitzvah of reciting<em> Shema</em>, he has fulfilled
    his obligation. However, if he continues reading as he was, without having <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill the mitzvah of saying <em>Shema</em>, he has not
    fulfilled his obligation (<em>Berachot</em> 13a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 60:4).
</p>
<p>
    It is therefore apparent that when reciting <em>Shema</em>, we must concentrate on two meanings. First, as with all the <em>mitzvot</em>, we must have in
    mind that in performing this act, we are fulfilling Hashem's commandment. Second, pertinent specifically to the mitzvah of reciting <em>Shema</em>, we must
    concentrate on the meaning of the words that we are saying. Since the essence of this mitzvah is to accept the yoke of Heaven, we are obligated to focus on
the meaning of our words. As we have learned in halachah 6, if one did not concentrate on the meaning of the words in the verse <em>Shema</em>    <em>Yisrael</em>, he did not fulfill his obligation and must go back and read it with the required <em>kavanah</em>.
</p>
<p>
We will now return to discuss the general <em>kavanah</em> required in the performance of all the <em>mitzvot</em>. Sometimes, one has implicit<em>kavanah</em>, and that suffices <em>b'dieved</em>. For instance, a person who comes to pray in a synagogue, and in his prayers he recites the    <em>Shema</em> paragraph, even though he did not explicitly intend to perform the mitzvah of reciting <em>Shema</em>, he fulfilled his obligation. For if
we were to ask him, "Why did you say <em>Shema</em>?" he would immediately answer, "To perform the mitzvah." Thus, in his recital he had implicit    <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation. Similarly, someone who puts on <em>tefillin</em>, even though he didn't meditate on what he was doing, it is
    nonetheless clear that his only intention could have been to fulfill the mitzvah, and because implicit <em>kavanah</em> was present, he fulfilled his
    obligation (<em>Yerushalmi Pesachim</em> 10:3; <em>Chayei Adam</em> 68:9; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 60:10).<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    Many people do not know that the main reason for the recital of the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph is to fulfill the commandment of remembering the Exodus from
    Egypt, which is mentioned at the end of the paragraph. Those unaware of this fact do not fulfill their obligation. For even if we were to ask them why they
said the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph, they would not know that it was in order to remember the Exodus. Apparently, there was not even implicit    <em>kavanah</em> within them. Therefore, it is important to teach that the reason for the recital of the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph is to remember the
    Exodus from Egypt.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. The Laws of Reciting <em>Shema</em>
</h2>
<p>
    A person must recite <em>Shema</em> with great <em>kavanah</em>, fear, awe, and trembling, and concentrate in his heart that he is now proclaiming the
    sovereignty of the King, <em>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</em>. Even though <em>Shema</em> is recited every day in <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Ma</em>'<em>ariv</em>,
    one must try hard to concentrate on the meaning of the words, as if they were new to him (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>61:1-2).
</p>
<p>
    In addition to <em>kavanah</em>, the person saying <em>Shema</em> must pronounce the letters precisely, being careful not to swallow any letter nor to
emphasize the soft sounds, or weaken the strong ones. Therefore, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, one should make a distinction in sound when pronouncing an<em>alef</em> and an <em>ayin</em>, a <em>chaf</em> and a <em>chet</em>, a <em>kamatz</em> and a <em>patach</em>, a <em>tzeirei</em> and a <em>segol</em> (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, 61:14-23). The <em>Chachamim</em> say, "One who recites <em>Shema</em> and is careful to pronounce its
    letters exactly, <em>Gehinnom</em> is cooled down for him" (<em>Berachot</em> 15b). <em>b'dieved</em>, if he did not recite the <em>Shema</em>
meticulously, he nevertheless fulfilled his obligation provided that he did not miss a word or a full syllable of a word (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 62:1;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 1).
</p>
<p>
    A person's ears must hear what is coming out of his mouth. <em>B'dieved</em>, if he read the words only with his lips but did not hear what he was saying,
    since he mouthed the words, he fulfilled his obligation. However, regarding one who only recited <em>Shema</em> in his mind, since he did not mouth the
    words, he did not fulfill his obligation (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 62:3; and see earlier in this book 1:9).<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>

In principle, though it is proper to recite <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em> in Hebrew, if a person recited <em>Shema</em> and prayed the    <em>Amidah</em> in a different language, he fulfilled his obligation, provided that he understands that language (see earlier in this book 1:10). However,
    a few of the major <em>Acharonim</em> write that today we cannot fulfill the obligation of <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> by reciting it in a different
language because there are words that we do not know how to translate accurately. For example, the Hebrew word "<em>v'shinantam</em>" means both learning (    <em>shinun</em>) and sharpening (<em>chidud</em>). There is no such single word in other languages. Hence, since the <em>Shema</em> cannot be translated
    exactly, it may not be recited in a different language (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 62:3).<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>

    10. The Manner in which to Recite <em>Shema </em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is permissible to recite <em>Shema</em> while standing, sitting, or lying down on one's side. Indeed, according to <em>Beit Shamai</em>, one must recite
    the <em>Shema</em> of the evening while lying down, and the <em>Shema</em> of the morning while standing, as it says, "When you lie down and when you rise
    up." Yet, the halachah follows <em>Beit Hillel</em> who interpreted the verse to mean the times that one is required to recite <em>Shema</em> - when people
    lie down (to go to sleep in the evening) and rise (wake up in the morning). According to Beit Hillel, whether the person stands, sits, or lies down is
    optional (<em>Berachot</em> 10a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 63:1).
</p>
<p>
    We can learn from this halachah that faith is not something detached from this world, something that can only be achieved under specific circumstances.
Rather, the faith expressed in saying <em>Shema</em> encompasses all of a person's life in this world, and therefore it is possible to recite    <em>Shema</em> in any position.
</p>
<p>
In principle, it is permissible to recite <em>Shema</em> even while walking, as it says, "When you are walking on your way." However, the    <em>Chachamim</em> maintain that it is not proper for a person to accept upon himself the yoke of Heaven casually. Therefore, one who is walking should
stand still when he recites the first verse of <em>Shema</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 63:3; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 9). It is also forbidden to say<em>Shema</em> while lying on one's stomach or back, since this is not a respectful recital (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 63:1; and see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,    <em>Even HaEzer</em> 23:3).<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
    Because of the importance of the first paragraph, in which we accept upon ourselves the yoke of Heaven, a person must be careful while saying it not to
    occupy himself with anything else, and not signal with his eyes, fingers, or lips (<em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 63:6).
</p>
<p>
    11. <em>Tefillin</em> and <em>Tzitzit</em> while Reciting <em>Shema</em>
</h2>
<p>
    We must pray and recite <em>Shema</em> of <em>Shacharit</em> with <em>tefillin</em>, as it says in the <em>Shema</em> paragraph, "And you shall bind them
as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes." The <em>Chachamim</em> say, "A person who recites <em>Shema</em> without wearing    <em>tefillin</em> is as if he gives false testimony of himself" (<em>Berachot</em> 14b). Nevertheless, even a person who does not have <em>tefillin</em> is
    required to recite <em>Shema</em>, since these two <em>mitzvot</em> are not interdependent. If a person cannot fulfill the mitzvah of <em>tefillin</em>, he
    should at least fulfill the mitzvah of <em>Shema</em>, and he is not considered giving false testimony, since it is due to circumstances beyond his control
    (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 46:33; see earlier in this book 12:9, footnote 10).
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to touch the <em>tefillin</em> of the arm when saying, "Bind them as a sign on your hand," and the <em>tefillin</em> of the head while
saying, "And they shall be as frontlets between your eyes," and then to kiss the hand that touched the <em>tefillin</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 61:25;    <em>Chayei Adam</em> 14:15).
</p>
<p>
It is also customary to wrap oneself in <em>tzitzit</em> before <em>Shacharit</em> since the third paragraph of <em>Shema</em> discusses the mitzvah of    <em>tzitzit</em>. It is customary to hold the <em>tzitziyot</em> with one's left hand adjacent to the heart during the time one says <em>Shema</em> as a
    reminder of what is written, "Put these words... on your heart" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 24:2). Some take the two <em>tzitziyot</em> in front and others
    gather all four <em>tzitziyot</em>.<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    It is customary before the paragraph of <em>Vayomer</em> to take the <em>tzitziyot</em> with one's right hand (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 24:4) or with both
    hands (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 24:8) and while saying the word "<em>tzitzit</em>," kiss the <em>tzitzit</em>, and while saying, "<em>u're'item oto</em>",
    ("and you shall see them"), look at them. Some pass them over their eyes and kiss them. It is also customary to kiss the <em>tzitzit</em> at the end of the
paragraph while saying "<em>emet</em>." We continue to hold the <em>tzitziyot</em> until the words, "<em>v'nechemadim la'ad</em>," in <em>Birkat</em>    <em>Emet V'Yatziv</em>, and then we kiss the <em>tzitziyot</em> again and put them down (<em>Mishnah Beru</em>ra<em>h</em> 24:4; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 24:8,
    18). There are additional customs concerning this; however, all these customs are enhancements of the mitzvah and do not prevent one from fulfilling one's
    obligation if they are not performed.
</p>
<p>
    12. 248 Words
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah provides life and healing to the world and to mankind. This is especially true concerning <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, in which the
    fundamentals of faith and the fulfillment of the <em>mitzvot</em> are included. The <em>Chachamim</em> teach that <em>Shema</em> is comprised of 248 words
    and that in a person's body there are 248 organs. When a person recites <em>Shema</em> properly, each and every organ is healed by the word corresponding
    to it. However, in the three paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> there are actually 245 words, and in order to total 248, the <em>chazan</em> repeats the last
    three words, "<em>Hashem Elokeichem emet</em>" ("Hashem, your God, is true"), thereby completing the count to 248 (<em>Zohar Chadash Ruth</em> 95:1).
</p>
<p>
A person who prays individually is missing the last three words. There are a few <em>minhagim</em> concerning their completion. According to the Ashkenazic<em>minhag</em>, before <em>Shema</em> a person says, "<em>Kel Melech Ne'eman</em>" ("Almighty faithful King"). According to the <em>Shulchan</em><em>Aruch</em>, one should have specific <em>kavanah</em> while pronouncing the first fifteen "<em>vavs</em>" in the opening words of <em>Birkat</em><em>Emet V'Yatziv</em> ("<strong><em>V</em></strong><em>'Yatziv</em>,<em> <strong>V</strong>'Nachon</em>,<em> <strong>V</strong>'Kayam</em>,<em> <strong>V</strong>'Yashar</em>, etc....") because they allude to three names of Hashem and are a substitute for the three missing words (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em> 61:3).
</p>
<p>
It is the <em>minhag</em> of most <em>Sephardim</em> that a person praying individually should complete the three missing words on his own and repeat "    <em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em> <em>emet</em>," instead of the <em>chazan</em>. Although an individual's repetition of these words is clearly less
important than the <em>chazan</em>'s reiteration, nevertheless, there is a certain substitution in it. Additionally, a person who finishes reciting    <em>Shema</em> after the <em>chazan</em> concludes "<em>Hashem Elokeichem emet</em>" should repeat those last words so as to complete the three missing
    words (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 61: 15-16).<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>

The question is to what the command, "Speak of them... when you lie down and when you get up," applies. According to the <em>Ramban</em>,<em>Ra'ah</em>, <em>Rashba</em>, <em>Ritva</em>, <em>Meiri</em>, <em>Rashbatz</em>, <em>Rabbi</em> <em>Yehudah</em> <em>HaChassid</em>, and            <em>Beit</em> <em>Yosef</em> 46:9, it applies only to the first verse. This is implied in the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 63:4, who writes
only concerning the first verse, that if a person did not have <em>kavanah</em>, he does not fulfill his obligation. In the opinion of<em>Talmidei Rabbi Yonah</em> and the <em>Yere'im</em>, the biblical mitzvah applies to the whole first paragraph. However, the words in            <em>V'hayah</em> <em>Im</em> <em>Shamo'a</em>, "Speak of them...when you lie down and when you get up" (Deuteronomy 11:19), refer to the mitzvah of
            learning Torah during the day and at night. The <em>Pri</em> <em>Chadash</em> 67 maintains that the biblical mitzvah is the recital of both the
first two paragraphs. See <em>Yabia</em> <em>Omer</em> 8:6:4. Also see <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> 58:15, who infers from a few            <em>Rishonim</em> that it is a biblical commandment to recite all three paragraphs. The <em>Mabit</em> explains in <em>Kiryat</em> <em>Sefer</em>
            that like in the mitzvah of learning Torah, a person who learned one verse already fulfilled the mitzvah, but the more he learns, the more he
            fulfills the mitzvah, so it is regarding the recital of <em>Shema</em>. There is a similar explanation in <em>Yad</em> <em>Peshutah</em> in his
            introduction to <em>Hilchot</em> <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>.

            See <em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah</em> 101:1 s.v. "<em>Hamitpalel</em>," based on the <em>Rashba</em> brought by the <em>Beit</em> <em>Yosef</em>
            63:4. The <em>Rashba</em> indicates that one must not let his mind wander and thereby not have <em>kavanah</em> to accept upon himself the yoke of
            Heaven. However, <em>b'dieved</em>, if he had <em>kavanah</em> and also dreamed in the middle, his dreaming did not nullify his <em>kavanah</em>.

            <em>Chazal</em>
            explain that this <em>kavanah</em> for the word "<em>Echad</em>" is only <em>l'chatchilah</em>, as it is told in <em>Berachot</em> 13b that Rabbi
            Yirmiyah greatly extended the word "<em>Echad</em>." Rabbi Chiya said to him, "Because you have anointed Him up and down and in all four
            directions, it is not necessary to have further <em>kavanah</em>." So it is regarding the <em>kavanah</em> in saying Hashem's Name. If the halachah
            is such that one who does not have the <em>kavanah</em> specified in the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> <em>Orach</em> <em>Chaim</em> 5 does not
fulfill his obligation, the Talmud should have specifically explained this obligation. Additionally, it seems from the words of the            <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> 62:3 that the required <em>kavanah</em> is for a general understanding of the verse. He writes that it is best
            that even one who does not understand the holy tongue recite <em>Shema</em> in Hebrew, since it is highly unlikely to find a Jew who does not
            understand the meaning of the first verse. This implies that he is referring to a general understanding.

In the opinion of the <em>Levush</em> and <em>Magen</em> <em>Avraham</em>, since the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted saying "<em>Baruch</em>            <em>shem</em>...," if a person skipped it, he did not fulfill his obligation and he must go back and recite the <em>Shema</em> paragraph. However,
            according to the <em>Shiltei</em> <em>HaGiborim</em>, <em>Bach</em>, and <em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah</em> (61:13, s.v. "<em>Acharei</em>"), he
            fulfilled his obligation. Their proof is from <em>Berachot</em> 13a, where it is written that a person who read the paragraph of <em>Shema</em>
            from the Torah, and had <em>kavanah</em> in his heart to perform the mitzvah of reciting <em>Shema</em>, fulfilled his obligation (even though the
            verse "<em>Baruch shem</em>..." is not written in the Torah.) According to this, if a person starts <em>V'ahavta</em> and realizes that he did not
have <em>kavanah</em> when he said "<em>Baruch shem</em>..." he is not required to repeat it. This is also written in the <em>Aruch</em>            <em>HaShulchan</em> 61:6. However, according to the <em>Levush</em> and <em>Magen</em> <em>Avraham</em>, one is required to go back and recite it
            again, and so writes <em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim</em> 61:45. Additionally, in 63:16, he writes according to the <em>Ari</em> that if one goes back to
            repeat "<em>Baruch shem</em>..." he must start over from "<em>Shema</em> <em>Yisrael</em>."

            Likewise, a person who comes to synagogue to hear the blowing of the s<em>hofar</em>, or the reading of the <em>megillah</em>, even though he did
            not explicitly have <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill the mitzvah, he fulfilled his obligation <em>b'dieved</em>, for the fact that he arrived at the
synagogue indicates his desire to fulfill the mitzvah, and that he had implicit <em>kavanah</em>. However, if he was in his house and he heard the            <em>shofar</em> being blown, or the <em>megillah</em> being read from the synagogue, and he did not explicitly have in mind to fulfill the mitzvah,
he did not fulfill his obligation. Nevertheless, according to those <em>poskim</em> who believe that <em>mitzvot</em> do not require            <em>kavanah</em>, he did fulfill his obligation.
        </p>
        <p>
The origin of the disagreement can be found in <em>Berachot</em> 13a and <em>Rosh</em> <em>Hashanah</em> 28-29a. According to Rava,            <em>mitzvot</em> do not require <em>kavanah</em>; however, Rabbi Zeira is of the opinion that <em>mitzvot</em> do need <em>kavanah</em>. The
following are the opinions of a few of the <em>poskim</em>: the <em>Tosafot</em> and <em>Talmidei</em> <em>Rabbeinu</em> <em>Yonah</em> write that            <em>mitzvot</em> do not require <em>kavanah</em>, in contrast to the <em>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</em>, <em>Rif</em>, and <em>Rosh</em> who maintain
            that <em>mitzvot</em> do require <em>kavanah</em>. That is also how the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em>, <em>Orach</em> <em>Chaim</em> 60:4,
            rules. The <em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah</em> explains that even those who maintain that <em>mitzvot</em> do not need <em>kavanah</em> still assert
            that two other conditions must be present: 1) when he is performing the mitzvah the person must know that such a mitzvah exists; for example, to
            recite <em>Shema</em> or eat matzah. If he knew this and at that particular moment he did not have even implicit <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill the
            mitzvah, according to them, he still fulfilled his obligation. 2) He must have in mind to perform the act and cannot be like a <em>mitasek</em> -
            one who is merely busying himself. In other words, if he unthinkably puffed into the <em>shofar</em> and kosher sounds came out, he did not fulfill
            the obligation of the mitzvah.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, there is dispute as to whether lack of <em>kavanah</em> in performing rabbinic commandments prevents a person from fulfilling his
            obligation. The <em>Magen</em> <em>Avraham</em> writes in the name of the <em>Radbaz</em> that the lack of <em>kavanah</em> while performing
            rabbinic commandments does not prevent a person from fulfilling the mitzvah. His reasoning is that we are unsure as to whom the halachah follows,
            and therefore, concerning biblical commandments we go according to those <em>poskim</em> who are stringent, and regarding rabbinic commandments we
            follow those who are lenient. However, according to the <em>Eliyah</em> <em>Rabbah</em>, <em>Gra</em>, and <em>Chida</em>, rabbinic commandments
            also require <em>kavanah</em>, and that is what is implied in the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em>. In any case, regarding <em>berachot</em> (even
those recited on biblical commandments) we take into consideration those <em>poskim</em> who believe that <em>mitzvot</em> do not require            <em>kavanah</em>, since "<em>safek</em> <em>berachot</em> <em>l'hakel</em>" - if there is doubt regarding the recital of <em>berachot</em>, we are
            lenient. Therefore, a person who did not have <em>kavanah</em> at the start, although required to go back and fulfill the mitzvah, he may not
            recite the blessing again due to the uncertainty that perhaps the halachah goes according to those who maintain that <em>mitzvot</em> do not
            require <em>kavanah</em> (<em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> 60:10 and <em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah </em>there).

            <em>Rabbi</em>
            <em>Yonah</em>
            maintain that it is proper to recite <em>Shema</em> with cantillation signs and there are those who are accustomed to enhancing the mitzvah in that
way (<em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 61:24). Others say that since <em>kavanah</em> is of principal importance, if someone finds that reciting<em>Shema</em> with cantillation signs disrupts his concentration, it is better that he recite <em>Shema</em> without them (<em>Rama</em>;            <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> 61:38).
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> 61:40 writes that, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, a person can fulfill his obligation of            <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> by hearing another person recite it. In the opinion of the <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> 62:8, one can fulfill
            his obligation by hearing <em>Shema</em> on condition that a <em>minyan</em> is present. (There is disagreement as to whether the person fulfilling
his obligation by hearing the <em>Shema</em> is required to understand the whole paragraph. See <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> and            <em>Ishei</em> <em>Yisrael</em> 20:26.)

            This is problematic, for translations are never precisely like the original and if <em>Chazal</em> say that one who recites <em>Shema</em> in any
language fulfilled his obligation, it can then be understood that it is unnecessary for the translation to be perfectly accurate. The            <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> 62:4 explains that, indeed, during the time of the <em>Mishnah</em> and Talmud, they completely understood the
Hebrew language. However, today, we have doubts regarding the meaning of some words, and therefore we cannot translate perfectly. The            <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> continues by giving some examples of uncertainties and concludes, "Therefore at this time, it is forbidden to
            recite the <em>Shema</em>, the prayers, and all the <em>berachot</em> in any language other than the holy tongue. And that is what the prominent
            learned scholars taught for approximately eighty years." Still, this remains problematic, for were there no doubts regarding language prior to that
            time? If so, why did they not teach then that one may not fulfill his obligation with a translation? Maybe this question was not very common and
            therefore it was not written down. Or perhaps it is possible to say that nowadays (especially after the invention of the printing press) we are
            more meticulous concerning the precise meaning of the words, and as a result doubts have increased. Hence, regarding our translations today, there
            is no precision, and therefore one may not fulfill his obligation with them. However, when people were not so meticulous in translating the
external meaning of the word, but rather focused on the idea that could be understood from the context, the translation was thought to be exact.            <strong>As a rule</strong>, even today, the <em>Makor</em> <em>Chayim</em> 62:2 writes that a <em>ger</em> <em>tzedek</em> (righteous convert) who
            does not read or understand Hebrew may recite <em>Shema</em> in translation.

According to the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 63:1, based on the majority of <em>Rishonim</em>, one may <em>l'chatchilah</em> recite            <em>Shema</em> while lying on his side. However, according to <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, only when a person has already gotten undressed,
            lies down, and it is difficult for him to sit up, is he permitted to recite <em>Shema</em> on his side, yet, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, <em>Shema</em>
            should not be recited while lying on one's side. The <em>Rama</em> rules like them. Regarding the recital of the bedtime <em>Shema</em>, which is
not a biblical obligation, it is the opinion of the <em>Magen</em> <em>Avraham</em> that one need not be strict about this. Also see            <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> 239:6.

The <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em>, in 24:5 and 61:25, explains that a person takes the two <em>tzitziyot</em> in front of him. So writes            <em>Yam Shel Shlomo</em> and the <em>Gra</em> in <em>Ma'aseh Rav</em> 39. There is an additional reason to do so, for sometimes the search for the
two <em>tzitziyot</em> in back can disrupt one's concentration while saying <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ahavat</em> <em>Olam</em>. However, the            <em>Ari</em> says that one should take hold of all four <em>tzitziyot</em>, as is brought by <em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim</em> 24:8, and so it is
            written in the <em>Birkei</em> <em>Yosef</em> and <em>Kitzur</em> <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 17:7. The <em>Birkei</em> <em>Yosef</em> writes
in the name of the <em>Ari</em> that one should hold his <em>tzitziyot</em> in his left hand between his ring finger and his pinky; so writes the            <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah </em>24:4<em>.</em> Also see <em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim</em> 24:9.

        <p>
            A few <em>Acharonim</em> write that a person should gather his <em>tzitziyot</em> when he says, "And bring us in peace from the four corners of the
            earth" in the <em>berachah</em> of <em>Ahavat</em> <em>Olam</em> (<em>Derech HaChaim</em>,<em> Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 17:7).

            The <em>Acharonim</em> are divided. According to the <em>Mahari</em> <em>Ayash</em>, <em>Sha'arei</em> <em>Teshuvah</em>, and many others, because
            he heard the <em>chazan</em> say "<em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em> <em>emet</em>," even though he did not finish saying <em>Shema</em>, those
            three words are considered part of the 248 words. That is the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em> and the <em>minhag</em> of a few <em>Sephardim</em> (as is
            clarified in <em>Sha'arei</em> <em>Tefillah</em>). However, the <em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim</em> 16 writes, based on<em> Kavanot HaAri</em>, that the
            recital of the three words must be in order. Therefore, if he heard the <em>chazan</em> say them before he concluded his recital of <em>Shema</em>,
            he repeats individually "<em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em> <em>emet</em>."
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also a difference of <em>minhag</em> regarding how the <em>chazan</em> (and according to the <em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim </em>also an
            individual praying) should complete these words, for if he says, "<em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em> <em>emet</em>" twice, he will have recited
            249 words. <em>Asarah</em> <em>Ma'amarot</em> and the <em>Gra</em> maintain that when the <em>chazan</em> finishes reciting <em>Shema</em> he
should only say "<em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em>" and afterwards go back and say "<em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em> <em>emet</em>." The            <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> and the <em>Pri</em> <em>Megadim</em> write that the <em>chazan</em> should also say "<em>emet</em>" the first
            time so as not to interrupt between "<em>Elokeichem</em>" and "<em>emet</em>" and that one of them is not considered part of the 248 because it
belongs to the <em>berachah</em> "<em>Emet</em> <em>V'Yatziv</em>." That is how <em>Ashkenazim</em> practice. It is the custom of the            <em>Sephardim</em> that at the conclusion of the <em>Shema</em> the <em>chazan</em> says out loud "<em>Hashem</em> <em>Elokeichem</em>" and the
            congregation completes the words and says after him "<em>emet</em>." At the same time, the <em>chazan</em> says "<em>emet</em>" quietly. Afterwards
            the <em>chazan</em> repeats the words "<em>Hashem Elokeichem emet</em>" out loud (<em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim</em> 61:12).
        </p>
        <p>
According to the <em>Chesed La'alafim</em>, it is the Sephardic custom that the congregation only says "<em>emet</em>" out loud after the            <em>chazan</em> when they finish together with the <em>chazan</em>. However, if they finish before him, they say "<em>emet</em>" individually so as
            not to pause between "<em>Elokeichem</em>" and "<em>emet</em>" and they should not repeat the word "<em>emet</em>" after the <em>chazan</em>
recites it. According to the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 61:12, when they finish individually, they do not say "<em>emet</em>," but rather wait until the            <em>chazan</em> finishes and answer after him "<em>emet</em>."
        </p>
        <p>
            In <strong><em>Ma'ariv</em></strong>, a person who did not hear the <em>chazan</em>, according to the<em> Kaf HaChaim</em>, should individually
            complete the words<em> </em>"<em>Hashem Elokeichem emet</em>." The Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em> is either to say "<em>Kel Melech Ne'eman</em>" before
the recital of <em>Shema</em> or, while saying "<em>emet</em>," to have in mind that it represents the three names of Hashem (            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 12). <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> writes that it is not necessary to complete 248 words in <em>Ma'ariv</em>, since the
            ruling in the <em>Gemara</em> is that there is no requirement to say the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph at night.
