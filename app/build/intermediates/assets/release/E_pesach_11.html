Chapter Eleven: Koshering the Kitchen
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1.Countertops
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Kitchen countertops are generally cold, but sometimes hot <em>hametz</em> foods or boiling pots from the stove are placed on them, and if some sauce spills
    on the countertop, it is absorbed at the level of a "<em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> removed from the flame" (see 10:8 above).
</p>
<p align="left">
    In order to kosher a countertop, one must first clean it well, paying special attention to crevices and making sure that no food remains stuck in them.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Marble countertops should ideally be koshered by pouring boiling water over them while placing a scalding hot stone or piece of metal on them. By doing so,
    the water is brought to a boil and reaches a koshering level of a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> removed from the flame. However, it is difficult to bring
    metal to such a heat in private homes, and doing so could damage the countertop. Therefore, the general practice is to suffice with pouring boiling water
    on the countertop. In this case, one should make sure not to use the countertop for Pesah foods until twenty-four hours have elapsed since the last time
    hot <em>hametz</em> foods were on the countertops. Instead of pouring hot water, one may also cover the countertops entirely with oilcloth or thick foil in
    order to separate between the countertops and the Pesah utensils.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Those who are stringent do both - they pour boiling water on the countertop and then cover it with linoleum or thick foil.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Fragile countertops, on which boiling pots are never placed, can be koshered by merely cleaning and pouring boiling water on them.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Some think that it is possible to kosher marble countertops by burning alcohol on them, but the koshering strength of alcoholic spirits is less than that
    of boiling water, and therefore boiling water should be poured on the countertop. Cleaning countertops with a steam cleaner is as effective as pouring
    boiling water on them, but where <em>hagala</em> in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> is required, it is ineffective.

<a name="2"></a><h2>
2. The Sink
</h2>
<p align="left">
    In general, the status of a sink is similar to that of a countertop, though in one respect it is less strict because it usually contains soap, which
    befouls the tastes of foods, and in another respect, it is more strict (if made of porcelain), because many <em>poskim</em> say that porcelain has the
    status of earthenware, which does not release tastes through <em>hagala</em>.
</p>
<p align="left">
    There are two accepted practices for koshering sinks. Those who are lenient clean the sink well and then pour boiling water all over it. Before pouring
    boiling water on a sink or countertop, it must be dried well, so that the boiling water touches it directly and is not cooled by any cold water on its
    surface. For this reason, one must first pour the boiling water on the sink and then on the countertop, starting with the areas closest to the sink and
    moving further away.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Those who are stringent, in addition to pouring boiling water on the sink, put a plastic insert in it or line it with thick aluminum foil in order to
    separate between the sink, which has absorbed <em>hametz</em>, and the Pesah utensils. These people are also careful not to use boiling water in the sink
    during Pesah.

<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. Grates, Burners, and Stovetops
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Throughout the year, people usually use the same stovetop grates for both meat and milk, because even if some meat or dairy food spills onto them, the
    flame incinerates and befouls whatever has spilled. However, people customarily perform light <em>libun</em> on such grates for Pesah, because of the
    seriousness of the <em>hametz</em> prohibition (Rema 451:4; MB <em>ad loc. </em>34). Alternatively, one may wrap thick aluminum foil around the bars on
which pots sit, so that there is a barrier between the Pesah pots and the parts of the grates that came into contact with <em>hametz</em>.    <em>Be-di'avad</em>, the food remains kosher even if cooked on grates that did not undergo <em>libun</em>.
</p>
<p align="left">
    The areas of the grates that do not come into contact with the pots, the enamel cook top beneath the grates, and the burners must be cleaned well of all
    residual food. Since none of these parts come into contact with the pots, they need not undergo <em>libun</em> or be covered with foil. Generally, people
    turn on all the flames for half an hour.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p align="left">
    It is also important to know that throughout the year one should be stringent and refrain from eating food that has fallen onto the enamel cook top under
    the grates, because meat and dairy foods spill there, and the enamel becomes not kosher. If one knows that the enamel has been cleaned thoroughly and that
    no meat and dairy foods have spilled on it in the past twenty-four hours, one may eat what falls there. But when these two conditions have not been met,
    one should be stringent and refrain from eating whatever comes into contact with this enamel, because it might have absorbed the taste of meat and milk. If
    a thick piece of food falls there, one may cut off the side that has come into contact with the enamel and eat the rest.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Electric ranges:</strong>
    Clean thoroughly and run on the highest setting for half an hour.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Ceramic burners:</strong>
    These look like smooth and unbroken glass surfaces on which pots are placed directly. They are koshered by cleaning and then heating on the highest setting
    for half an hour, based on the principle of <em>ke-bole'o kakh</em> <em>polto</em>.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Ovens
</h2>
<p align="left">
    To kosher an oven, clean it thoroughly and run it at its highest setting for half an hour.
</p>
<p align="left">
    It is difficult to kosher baking trays. Because they absorb through fire, they require heavy <em>libun</em>, but since heavy <em>libun</em> will cause them
    serious damage, they may not be koshered (see above 9:7). One must therefore buy special baking trays for Pesah, while the <em>hametz</em> trays must be
    cleaned and put away like all other <em>hametz</em> utensils. If one does not have Pesah trays, he may use disposable trays. However, he must also kosher
    the racks along with the oven and cover them with aluminum foil, and only then he may place the disposable trays on the racks.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Ovens that self-clean at a temperature of 500ï¿½C need not be cleaned before koshering because such intense heat is considered heavy <em>libun</em> and is
    sufficient to kosher the oven for Pesah.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. Warming Trays (Shabbat "<em>Plata</em>"s)
</h2>
<p align="left">
Sauce from <em>hametz</em> food occasionally spills from pots onto the warming tray ("<em>plata</em>"), and since the <em>plata </em>is a heat source, the    <em>hametz</em> is absorbed with the intensity of a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on the flame. On other occasions, dry <em>hametz</em> dishes (such as
    porridges, kugels, and quiches) fall onto the <em>plata</em>, which constitutes absorption through fire and must be koshered through <em>libun</em>.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A <em>blekh </em>(a metal sheet that is placed atop a gas range on Shabbat) can be koshered through <em>libun</em> if there is no alternative, even though
    it will warp and become damaged. But when it comes to an electric warming tray, <em>libun</em> is liable to melt the electrical wires and ruin it.
    Therefore, one must clean it, heat it for an hour, and then cover it with aluminum foil to separate the <em>plata </em>from the Pesah pots.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. Microwave Ovens
</h2>
<p align="left">
    The common practice is to kosher a microwave oven in four steps: 1) cleaning it thoroughly of any residual food resulting from spillage or vaporization; 2)
waiting twenty-four hours so that the absorbed taste becomes foul; 3) heating a container of water in it for three minutes (since microwave ovens absorb    <em>hametz</em> via vapor that rises from food as it is heated); 4) placing something as a barrier between the turntable and the food that will be heated
    in the microwave, because <em>hametz</em> may have spilled onto the turntable.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. Dishwasher
</h2>
<p align="left">
    The filter, where residual food often gets stuck, must be cleaned thoroughly. Then the dishwasher should be run at its hottest setting, so that any
    absorbed <em>hametz</em> is released, <em>ke-bole'o kakh</em> <em>polto</em>. Regarding the racks, <em>le-khathila</em> they should undergo <em>hagala</em>
or <em>irui</em> with boiling water or be replaced. If it is difficult to kosher them through <em>hagala</em> or to replace them, one may perform    <em>hagala</em> by running them through the dishwasher's longest and hottest setting.
</p>
<p align="left">
    In any event, one must wait twenty-four hours after the last load of <em>hametz</em> utensils before using the machine with Pesah utensils.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Some take a stringent approach to dishwashers and consider them to have the status of a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on a flame. This means that to kosher
    a dishwasher one must put a white-hot piece of metal in it in order to boil the water. However, those who follow the lenient approach have authorities on
    whom to rely.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. The Dining Table
</h2>
<p align="left">
    In the past, people would kosher their tables by pouring boiling water over them, and some took the stringent approach of pouring boiling water onto a
    white-hot stone on the table, so that the koshering would be at the level of <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>. However, today's tables are more delicate and
    fragile, and would be damaged, warped, or defaced by boiling hot water.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Therefore, the mainstream approach is to clean the table well and affix nylon or paper to it, creating a set barrier between the table and Pesah<em> </em>
    utensils and foods. In addition, a tablecloth should be spread over the nylon or paper, and it is a good idea to avoid placing boiling hot pots directly on
    the table.
</p>
<p align="left">
    One may kosher a tablecloth used for <em>hametz </em>by laundering it in a washing machine.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Those who wish to knead dough for Pesah must prepare a different surface, because it is difficult to kosher tables for kneading dough.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A table on which no hot <em>hametz</em> foods were placed throughout the year must be cleaned well, but there is no need to cover it.
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
9. The Refrigerator and Kitchen Cabinets
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Because they are used with cold food, the only concern is that some <em>hametz</em> crumbs might remain there. Therefore, cleaning them is what koshers
    them. In hard to reach places where <em>hametz</em> crumbs may have gotten stuck, one must pour soapy water or some other substance that will befoul the
    crumbs and render them unfit for animal consumption.
</p>
<p align="left">
    When kitchen cupboards were made of natural wood, they often had cracks that were difficult to clean completely from <em>hametz</em> that got stuck there.
    Aharonim therefore ruled that the shelves should be covered with paper or cloth (MB 451:115). However, there is no concern that <em>hametz </em>remained in
    smooth shelves like those used today. Therefore, once they have been cleaned properly, they need not be covered with paper or cloth.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
10. Pots, Skillets, Silverware, and (Non-Earthenware) Bowls
</h2>
<p align="left">
    We detailed the laws relating to <em>hagala</em> of pots in the previous chapter. The principle is that intensity of koshering must match the intensity of
absorption (see above 10:8), but the custom, <em>le-khathila</em>, is to kosher everything through <em>hagala</em> in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> (<em>ibid</em>. 9). Before koshering a pot one must clean it (<em>ibid</em>. 10). We have already learned how to perform <em>hagala</em> in practice (    <em>ibid</em>. 12), and how to kosher a large pot that cannot be inserted into another pot (<em>ibid</em>. 13).
</p>
<p align="left">
According to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, skillets are koshered for Pesah through <em>hagala</em>, and during the rest of the year they are koshered through    <em>libun</em>. According to Rema, they are koshered through light <em>libun</em> for Pesah as well (<em>ibid</em>. 4). Non-stick or Teflon frying pans
    cannot be koshered, since people fry in them without using oil that has been brought to a sizzle, which means that such pans require heavy <em>libun</em>.
    Since this procedure ruins them, they cannot be koshered.
</p>
<p align="left">
Though eating utensils absorb principally as a <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em>, the custom is to kosher them through <em>hagala</em> in a <em>kli</em>    <em>rishon</em> on the flame. This is because the custom, <em>le-khathila</em>, is to kosher all utensils in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on a flame.
Even if one sometimes uses a fork in a pot on the flame, it may be koshered through <em>hagala</em> because it will be damaged by <em>libun</em> and is    <em>batel</em> <em>be-rov</em> (as explained above 10:9 n. 11).
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>
11. Blenders and Mixers
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Electrical appliances such as blenders and mixers are occasionally used to mince and mix hot and sometimes sharp foods.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Regarding such appliances, one must follow the established principles and always relate to two problems: 1) <em>hametz</em> may have gotten stuck in
    crevices and holes; 2) the taste of <em>hametz</em> may have been absorbed into the walls of the appliance.
</p>
<p align="left">
    If such an appliance was used with cold, non-sharp foods only, there is no problem of absorption, but there is still concern that food particles got stuck
    in its crevices. It must therefore be cleaned thoroughly. If there are grooves in which food particles remain, the appliance may not be koshered;
    alternatively, it may be soaked in soapy water or in some other agent that renders the residual food unfit for canine consumption.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Mixers have holes designed to provide ventilation for the motor, so that it does not overheat. Flour and pieces of dough splatter into these holes, and
    there is concern that, when used with Pesah foods, pieces of <em>hametz</em> will fall into the food. In order to kosher a mixer, one must open the motor
    compartment and clean it thoroughly, or plug up the holes completely. This rule applies to any appliance about which there are similar concerns.
</p>
<p align="left">
    If such an appliance was used with hot foods, and one was not cautious about <em>hametz</em> throughout the year, there is concern that it has absorbed the
    taste of <em>hametz</em>. Therefore, one must perform <em>hagala</em> on all parts that came into contact with hot food.
</p>
<p align="left">
    And if such an appliance was used with sharp foods, and one was not cautious about <em>hametz</em> throughout the year, even if the foods were always cold,
there is concern that contact with the strong sharpness caused the taste of <em>hametz</em> to be absorbed by the appliance. One must therefore perform    <em>hagala</em> on all parts that came into contact with food (see SA YD 96:1; <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>1).
</p>
<p align="left">
If the appliance was used for kneading dough, according to the Sephardic custom <em>hagala</em> is necessary, and according to Ashkenazic custom light    <em>libun</em> is needed (based on SA 451:17).
</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>
12. Other Utensils
</h2>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Silver goblets:</strong>
    It is proper, <em>le-khathila</em>, to perform <em>hagala</em> on silver goblets used for <em>kiddush </em>wine and other hard drinks, because crumbs
    sometimes fall into the goblet along with these strong drinks, which, according to some <em>poskim</em>, causes their taste to be absorbed into the goblet
    after eighteen minutes (as explained above 10:14).
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Plastic baby bottles:</strong>
    It is better to replace them because they absorb tastes at a level of <em>irui</em> from a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>. When necessary, one may clean them
    and perform <em>hagala</em>.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Electric water heaters, urns, samovars, and hot water kettles </strong>
    must undergo <em>hagala</em>, because <em>hametz</em> crumbs may have fallen into them, causing their taste to be absorbed. <em>Hagala </em>in this case
means filling the device to the top with water, boiling it, and then pouring it out through the opening generally used to dispense the water. Before    <em>hagala</em>, it is good to clean out the stone deposits that accumulated inside. If one puts challah loaves on the lid of the urn to warm them before
    the <em>Shabbat </em>meal, <em>hagala</em> should be performed on the kettle and its lid.
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Thermos:</strong>
    After cleaning it properly, <em>hagala</em> should be performed on it. If this is difficult, pouring boiling water into it and around its opening is
    sufficient.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Toaster:</strong>
    This requires heavy <em>libun</em>, and since it is liable to be damaged in the process, it should not be koshered.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Kneading Utensils:</strong>
    Rema maintains that such utensils <em>le-khathila</em> require light <em>libun</em>, but since they are likely to be damaged, they should not be koshered
    (451:16, 17). According to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, it is possible to kosher them via <em>hagala</em>. <em>Le-khathila</em>, the custom is to be stringent,
    in keeping with Rema's ruling (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 451:196, 263).
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>False Teeth:</strong>
    These should be cleaned thoroughly before the onset of the <em>hametz</em> prohibition. They need not undergo <em>hagala</em>, because people do not
    normally put boiling foods or liquids in their mouths; just as they are used for both meat and dairy when cleaned in between, so can they be used on Pesah.
Some believe that due to the gravity of the <em>hametz</em> prohibition, they must be koshered in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> or <em>kli</em>    <em>sheni</em>.

<a name="13"></a><h2>
13. Earthenware and Porcelain Utensils
</h2>
<p align="left">
    If earthenware absorbs <em>hametz</em> hot, even via a <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em>, <em>hagala</em> is not effective. Although <em>libun</em> would
    effectively burn the taste absorbed in the utensil, the Sages forbid koshering earthenware utensils through <em>libun</em> because there is concern that
    they will crack (see above 10:7). If used cold, however, one may kosher them by washing them thoroughly. If a <em>hametz</em> beverage was allowed to sit
    in such a vessel for twenty-four hours, one may kosher it by soaking it in water for three consecutive days (<em>ibid</em>. 14).
</p>
<p align="left">
    China, clay, and ceramic utensils are considered earthenware.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Regarding porcelain which, though made like earthenware, has a smooth surface like glass, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that it has the status of
earthenware, and there is no way to kosher it. This is the <em>halakha</em> (MB 451:163; <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> <em>ibid. </em>305). However, some    <em>poskim</em> believe that since the surface of porcelain is smooth like glass, it does not absorb at all. When there are additional doubts, their
    lenient opinion is taken into account.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>
14. Glassware
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Leading Rishonim take diametrically opposed positions regarding the status of glass utensils.
</p>
<p align="left">
    According to Rabbeinu Tam, Rosh, Rashba, Ran, and many others, glass is smooth and hard, and even if it had been used to hold boiling hot foods, it does
    not absorb their tastes. Therefore, even if glass utensils were used with boiling-hot <em>hametz</em> throughout the year, they may be rinsed thoroughly
    and used on Pesah. This is the position adopted in SA 451:26. Similarly, glass utensils may be used alternately for hot meat and hot dairy foods, as long
    as they are cleaned well in between.
</p>
<p align="left">
    According to <em>Smag</em>, <em>Smak</em>, <em>Mordechai</em>, <em>Agur</em>, and <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em>, glass, because it is made of sand, has the
status of earthenware, which is also made of sand and which absorbs tastes but does not release them. Therefore, if one uses glass utensils with hot    <em>hametz</em> foods, there is no way to kosher them for Pesah. This is the position adopted by Rema.
</p>
<p align="left">
    There is also a third position, which maintains that glass utensils have the same status as metal utensils, which can absorb and release when boiling hot.
    However, since glass utensils are fragile and liable to break during <em>hagala</em>, there is no way to kosher them for Pesah (<em>Or</em> <em>Zaru'a</em>
    , <em>Shibolei</em> <em>Ha-leket</em>).
</p>
<p align="left">
    In practice, many Sephardim follow <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>'s opinion<em> </em>that glass utensils do not absorb and thus may be rinsed thoroughly and used
    on Pesah. However, there are important Sephardic authorities who are stringent in this regard, Ben Ish Hai among them (Year One, Tzav 14).
</p>
<p align="left">
    In Ashkenazic communities, some follow Rema's stringent ruling while others adopt the middle opinion, allowing glass to be koshered via <em>hagala</em> on
    the grounds that today's glass is stronger than in the past and capable of enduring <em>hagala</em>. There is even more of a tendency to be lenient with
    tempered glass cookware (like Pyrex), which is fire resistant. Some rule that <em>hagala </em>should be performed three times on glassware.
</p>
<p align="left">
    In practice, Ashkenazic Jews do not kosher glass utensils for Pesah through <em>hagala</em>, in keeping with Rema, and only under pressing circumstances
    rely upon the lenient position. With regard to prohibitions other than <em>hametz</em>, the tendency is to rely upon the lenient <em>poskim</em>, waiting
    twenty-four hours from when the utensil last contained hot food and performing <em>hagala</em> three times.

</p>
<a name="15"></a><h2>
15. Enamel Utensils
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Enamel utensils are made of metal and coated with a thin layer of enamel for aesthetic reasons. The inside of the pot is usually colored white, while the
    outside is decorated with different colors. Enamel is made of sand like glassware, but it is processed differently. Great uncertainty arose regarding such
    utensils. At first, <em>poskim</em> were uncertain because the craftsmen kept enamel's composition secret. Then, when it became known that enamel is made
    of sand, uncertainly arose again as to whether such utensils have the status of earthenware.
</p>
<p align="left">
In practice, the <em>poskim</em> rule that one may perform <em>hagala</em> on enamel utensils like all other metal utensils, and some recommend performing<em>hagala</em> three times. Yet regarding Pesah, some instruct not to perform <em>hagala</em> on enamel utensils in light of the severity of the    <em>hametz</em> prohibition.
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<a name="16"></a><h2>
16. Plastic Utensils
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Plastic utensils that have absorbed the taste of boiling hot food are koshered via <em>hagala</em> with boiling water, like all other utensils. This is
true of all types of metal, such as silver, copper, iron, aluminum, etc., as well as utensils of leather, wood, and bone. It is earthenware alone that the<em>poskim</em> say cannot be koshered, because, due to its unique composition, it is very absorbent, but does not release all that it absorbs. And some    <em>poskim</em> say that glassware has the same status as earthenware.
</p>
<p align="left">
    However, <em>Igrot</em> <em>Moshe</em> (OH 1:92) states that one should not perform <em>hagala</em> on utensils made of plastic or other synthetic
    materials not mentioned by the Rishonim, since such materials might be like earthenware, which does not release what it has absorbed. Nonetheless, the
    overwhelming majority of Aharonim agree that <em>hagala </em>is effective on plastic utensils, and this is the <em>halakha</em>. Utensils made of hard
plastic are koshered through <em>hagala</em> in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on the flame, whereas plastic utensils that are liable to be damaged in a    <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on the burner can be koshered at the same level they absorbed the <em>hametz</em>.

            Rabbeinu Yeruham that one must kosher such a table according to its most intense usage, i.e., a <em>kli rishon </em>removed from the flame.
            Therefore, one must pour boiling water over a scorching stone on the table, effectively koshering it on the level of a <em>kli rishon </em>removed
            from the flame. However, as we saw in 10:9 above, in extenuating circumstances one may kosher a utensil based on its main usage; in this case
            merely washing the table would suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practically, even one relying on the lenient opinions should at least pour boiling water on the countertop or cover it with an oilcloth. Those who
            act stringently both pour boiling water and cover the table, preferring not to rely solely on a covering that may slide around. It is worth
            mentioning the concern raised by some that cheaper countertops made of compressed stone have the status of earthenware, on which <em>hagala </em>is
            ineffective. However, even earthenware can be koshered by merely washing it, as long as the majority of its usage is with cold items. Additionally,
            it seems more likely that compressed stone countertops do not have the same status as earthenware vessels; see <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em>
13:1. Nevertheless, there are better grounds for covering this type of countertop. See also <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 8:2 and            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 451:44.

            See <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em> 13:433 regarding koshering a countertop with alcohol. We do not condemn one who uses this method, as long as he
            cleaned the countertop well, since <em>be-di'avad </em>cleaning a countertop, whose primary usage is cold, with cold water is effective. Cleaning
            with the alcohol alone, however, is ineffective.

. Its most intense form of absorption is as a <em>kli rishon </em>removed from the flame, since sometimes one places pots of boiling-hot            <em>hametz</em> in it. One who wants to kosher it based on its most serious usage must place a scalding stone in boiling water and pour the water
onto the sink. However, according to many <em>poskim</em>, a porcelain sink has the status of earthenware and cannot be koshered via            <em>hagala</em>. In such a case, one must cover the walls of the sink with a plastic insert or aluminum foil. They are also careful not to fill the
sink with boiling water, lest the taste absorbed in the walls of the sink become absorbed in the Pesah utensils. Even if the sink is not            <em>ben yomo</em> and tastes absorbed in it are thus foul, according to Rema 447:10 even this is forbidden on Pesah.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Those who are lenient rely on SA 451:6 that we follow the main usage, which in the case of a sink is with cold foods. This method is thus effective
            even if the sink is made of earthenware. Additionally, according to <em>Knesset Ha-gedola</em>, porcelain is akin to glass, which does not absorb
            at all, and not earthenware. Moreover, since there is usually residual dish soap in the sink, any <em>hametz </em>taste absorbed into the sink
would have been foul from the outset, so the sink would not need to be koshered. And even if we assume that the sink absorbed flavorful            <em>hametz</em>, it would turn foul once twenty-four hours had elapsed. Even though according to Rema foul-tasting <em>hametz</em> is forbidden on
            Pesah, the present case involved absorption that is, at worst, third degree (<em>nat bar nat bar nat</em>), and, as we have seen, MB 447:98 states
that one may be lenient about foul tastes where there is no existing custom, and there is no existing custom about <em>nat bar nat bar nat</em>.            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em><em> </em>8:1 and <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em> 124-127 write more about koshering sinks.

            . Throughout the year, we cook both meat and dairy pots atop the grate because taste is not transferred through dry metal. For example, if a hot
            meat pot touched a hot dairy pot, as long as both pots were dry in the spot that they touched, both pots are kosher. Similarly, even if the grate
            absorbed the taste of meat, once it dries the taste does not transfer to a dairy pot. Even if a drop of dairy spilled onto the grate in the same
            spot that meat liquid had previously spilled, the pot remains kosher, since the flame is constantly heating the grate, and whatever liquid had
            previously spilled on it has already been incinerated. Due to the stringent nature of the <em>hametz</em> prohibition, light <em>libun </em>is
required but not heavy <em>libun</em>, since technically the grates need not be koshered at all. <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim</em> 451:82 (citing            <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em>) concurs that <em>le-khathila </em>grates should undergo <em>libun</em>, but <em>be-di'avad </em>they are not
prohibited. <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> p. 75 states that <em>hagala</em> is sufficient to kosher grates, but SAH<em> </em>maintains that light<em>libun</em> is necessary. I believe that covering the grates with aluminum foil is as effective as light <em>libun</em> and perhaps even heavy            <em>libun</em>, since it completely separates the grate from the pots, so that even if some liquid spills, it would not connect the grate and the
            pot.

            . Some are stringent and insist that ovens cannot be koshered for Pesah, due to a concern (present in older ovens) that crumbs would fall into the
            door of the oven before Pesah and mix into the Pesah food. The solution to this problem is to clean the door of the oven with a lot of soap,
            thereby befouling the taste of any crumbs stuck there and rendering them unfit for a dog's consumption. Others are stringent out of concern that
            perhaps food touched the walls of the oven, which would mean the oven would need to be koshered with heavy <em>libun</em> - impossible without
            damaging the oven. But most <em>poskim</em> rule that ovens can be koshered since the oven itself rarely comes into contact with food and only
            absorbs steam from the food. Light <em>libun</em> at the oven's highest temperature would certainly kosher it. Even if some <em>hametz</em> spilled
            and its taste was absorbed in the walls of the oven, we have seen that SA (451:6) permits koshering utensils (and ovens) based on the main usage.
Even MB (451:48) is lenient in such a case, provided that one performs light <em>libun</em>. We can also add the opinion that the absorption of            <em>hametz</em> before Pesah is considered <em>heteira bala</em>, for which light <em>libun</em> is effective even <em>le-khathila </em>(see above
            10:6). Finally, we may factor in the opinion that <em>ke-bole'o kakh polto </em>applies to the temperature of the <em>libun</em> (see above 10:5),
            so heating the oven at its highest setting is effective.
        </p>
        <p>
            With regard to baking trays, however, we are stringent and require heavy <em>libun</em>. However, if one conducts light <em>libun</em> on a tray,
            he may place a disposable tray inside of the multi-use tray, and certainly atop the racks. It is best to cover the racks with aluminum foil, so
            that if something spills onto them it will not connect the Pesah tray to the insufficiently koshered racks. One need not wait twenty-four hours
before koshering them, since light <em>libun</em><em> </em>releases and incinerates the taste absorbed in the utensil. See            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 8:3, which treats this issue at length and explains the entire process of koshering an oven.
        </p>
        <p>
            For ovens that self-clean at 500ï¿½C and incinerate all dirt, since they heat to a temperature that certainly would cause obsolete alloys to spark or
            redden (see above 10:5), this self-cleaning qualifies as heavy <em>libun</em> and koshers the oven. Baking trays may also be koshered at this heat,
            but manufacturers' instructions caution that leaving trays in such heat can ruin them. Consequently, they cannot be koshered by this method (see
            above 10:7).

            . I have written in accordance with the currently accepted ruling. R. Mordechai Eliyahu rules that one must also take care to cover any food that
            he heats up on Pesah. Conversely, R. Nachum Rabinovitch writes that it is sufficient to simply clean the microwave and place a barrier between the
            turntable and the food. R. Henkin also agreed with R. Rabinovitch.
        </p>
        <p>
            (The accepted practice for switching between meat and dairy use is as written above. Alternatively, one may hermetically seal all food, or at least
            one of the types [meat or dairy]. One may also use perforated covers, one designated for meat and one for dairy, every time he heats food in the
            microwave, which allows steam to escape but prevents it from going into the food. In either of these last two options, one must place a barrier
between the food and the turntable. According to R. Rabinovitch, simply cleaning the microwave suffices, even if one did not cover the food.)            <u></u>

            . The highest temperature of the water in the dishwasher is c. 80ï¿½C. A dishwasher absorbs at the level of <em>irui </em>from a <em>kli rishon </em>
(see above 10:8), since the water is heated by an element (the <em>kli rishon</em>) and then sprayed at the dishes. Thus,<em>ke-bole'o kakh polto </em>applies. Nevertheless, the custom is to kosher all utensils in a <em>kli rishon </em>on a flame; thus,<em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 3:58 states that one should place a scorching hot stone in the dishwasher. When this is difficult, one may perform            <em>hagala </em>using the mechanism of absorption, because most <em>poskim</em> maintain that one must perform <em>hagala </em>using boiling water
            only when koshering a <em>kli rishon </em>used on the flame; when koshering a utensil that absorbed via <em>irui </em>from a<em> kli rishon</em>,
            the <em>hagala </em>water only needs to reach <em>yad soledet </em>(see above ch. 10, n. 10). This is certainly the case vis-a-vis the dishwasher,
            which is koshered at least at the same temperature at which it absorbed. Technically, the racks may be koshered in this manner, but since they
            actually came into contact with food, some authorities ruled that they must be koshered via <em>hagala </em>in boiling water, or at least via
            pouring boiling water on them (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>). Additionally, some authorities consider the dishwasher to be akin to a <em>kli rishon </em>on
            the flame; according to these authorities, one must kosher the dishwasher at the intensity of a <em>kli rishon </em>on the flame. According to
            these authorities, one may only be lenient vis-a-vis the walls of the dishwasher, which do not usually come into contact with food, but not
            vis-a-vis the racks (R. Pfeiffer's <em>Kitzur </em>SA<em>, Basar Be-halav</em> vol. 2, explanations 6 and 7). Notwithstanding this stringent view,
            the mainstream opinion is that the absorption was at the level of <em>irui</em>; therefore, when alternatives are difficult, one may kosher the
            racks inside the dishwasher. This is the opinion in <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em> 13:225-228. Additionally, several authorities maintain that the
            principle of <em>ke-bole'o kakh polto</em> applies to the temperature of the absorption in a <em>kli rishon</em>, so certainly the dishwasher's
            highest setting is sufficient to kosher the trays (see SAH<em> </em>451:25 and <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato </em>1:4).
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>
            maintains that if the body of the dishwasher is made of porcelain, it cannot be koshered (this is very uncommon; see also below n. 11 that there
            are those who are lenient, especially since the food does not touch the walls and it is likely that the dishwashing detergent ruined any taste even
            before it was absorbed. Thus, there is room to be lenient, as with a sink). See also <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 8:32, which rules stringently
            and requires one to use a white-hot stone to kosher a dishwasher. <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 451:25 states that there is concern about koshering
            plastic, as some <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is impossible to kosher plastic (<em>ibid</em>. 53). However, the mainstream opinion and the view
            of most <em>poskim</em> is that plastic can be koshered via <em>hagala</em>, plus this is a situation of uncertainty regarding a rabbinic
            prohibition, as twenty-four hours have elapsed since the dishwasher's last use. <em>Hagalat Kelim</em> 13:91 concludes that <em>poskim</em>
            maintain that plastic utensils can be koshered. R. Dov Lior is lenient regarding all types, as I have written.

            . SA<em> </em>451:20 states that the custom is to pour boiling water on the tables, since <em>hametz</em> soup would sometimes spill onto the
            table. MB 114 adds in the name of <em>Responsa Mahari Weil</em> ï¿½193 that since sometimes hot quiches are placed on the table, it absorbs taste on
the level of <em>kli rishon</em>, so one would need to kosher it with a white-hot stone. Additionally, it states in par. 17 that one must perform            <em>hagala</em> on kneading tablets since dough is routinely left on the tables until it turns into <em>hametz</em>, making them comparable to a
container for storing sourdough ("<em>beit se'or</em>"). Rema states that the custom is to avoid Pesah use of tables that were used for kneading<em>hametz</em>, since they would need to be koshered via light <em>libun</em>. Rema<em> </em>also states in par. 16 that the custom is to kosher a            <em>beit se'or</em> via light <em>libun</em><em>.</em>

            It is clear that there is a difference between their tables, made of thick, strong wood that could withstand a koshering process involving boiling
            water and white-hot stones, and our tables, made of fiber board or plywood covered in Formica, wood veneer, or an alternative. Technically, when
            necessary one may follow the main use of the table, which is with cold items; therefore, SA states, "the <strong>general practice</strong> is to
            pour boiling water on the tables," implying that this is not an absolute requirement. Even according to Rema, who says that the koshering method
            follows the most severe usage, if the table is separated from the Pesah food by a nylon or paper covering, there is no concern that the food
            absorbed in the table will pass through the barrier, especially if one is careful not to place boiling hot pots directly on the table, only atop a
            plate or trivet. Moreover, since our tables are more fragile, people rarely place boiling hot pots directly on the table, so the concern that the
            table will absorb <em>hametz</em> on the level of a <em>kli rishon</em> is more implausible.

            . This matter is unclear. Since there is no liquid present and the challah reached the temperature of <em>yad soledet</em>, perhaps it should be
            considered to have absorbed the taste of challah as though by means of direct fire, meaning that the lid would need heavy <em>libun</em> - a
            process that it certainly will not be able to withstand. On the other hand, since there is no liquid present the taste of the challah may not
            become absorbed into the lid at all, just as taste does not pass between two dry pieces of metal. The custom is to be lenient, especially once
            factoring in the opinion that <em>hametz</em> throughout the year has the status of "<em>heteira,</em>" and thus <em>hagala</em> is effective where
            normally <em>libun</em> would be (see above 10:6) and that once twenty-four hours passed since its use, it becomes a doubt relating to a rabbinic
            law. However, since there was definitely <em>hametz </em>on the urn, the lid should undergo <em>hagala </em>in boiling water.

            insisting that they be koshered by <em>irui </em>of boiling water. <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 9:25 states that technically one need only scrub them
            well, but there are stringent opinions that insist on performing <em>hagala</em> in either a <em>kli rishon</em> or <em>kli sheini</em>.

            . <em>Shiyarei Knesset Ha-gedola </em>OH 451, <em>Hagahot Beit Yosef</em> 30 states that the universal custom is to use porcelain on Pesah even if
            it was used for <em>hametz</em> throughout the year, since porcelain is like glass which does not absorb. He was stringent for himself, as per the
            opinion of Radbaz, but did not rule stringently for others. <em>She'elat Yaavetz</em> 1:67 also permits it. <em>Pri Hadash</em> states that one may
            only be lenient if he has authentic porcelain, but nowadays, since there is much counterfeit porcelain, all agree that one must be stringent. This
            is also the opinion of <em>Mahzik Berakha</em> 451:10, as quoted in <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim</em> 451:305, and <em>Kol Mevasser</em> 1:80. This is
the accepted custom. However, one may be lenient if there are other doubts, as explained by the Aharonim cited in <em>Hagalat Kelim</em> 13:368 and            <em>Yabi'a Omer </em>YD 1:6 and 7:10.

            When porcelain breaks, one can see that its inner texture is coarse, like earthenware, and its outer texture is smooth. There are also porcelain
            utensils that are smooth on the inside and coarse on the outside. It seems that if a utensil like this absorbed in its coarse area, everyone would
            agree that it has the status of earthenware. Nowadays, most dishes are made of tempered glass, which is sand-based and has a hard texture like
            glass, even though it is not always smooth as glass. I am often asked whether such dishes can be koshered via <em>hagala </em>if they were used for
            non-kosher or for milk and meat. In my humble opinion, these dishes should be considered like glass, since when they break one can see that they
are made of dense material - like glass, not like porcelain. They thus have the status of quality glass utensils that can withstand the            <em>hagala</em><em> </em>process, as will be explained in the next section. Even the Ashkenazic custom is to be lenient when necessary to kosher
            such a utensil from forbidden taste it absorbed. To dispel all doubt, one should kosher the utensil with <em>hagala</em> three times (it is not
            necessary to use three separate refills of water), since according to <em>Itur </em>this would even work for earthenware. It seems that even
according to the custom of SA glassware does not need to be koshered, since today's dishes are not so smooth that they should undergo triple            <em>hagala</em>. (I have not mentioned any particular brand names since companies constantly change the composition of their products; I have
            referred specifically to utensils whose hard texture is similar to that of glass.)

. Among Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em> who permit <em>hagala</em> on glassware if there is no concern that it will break are: R. Shlomo Kluger in            <em>Responsa Tuv Ta'am Va-da'at</em>, third edition 2:25 and <em>Responsa </em><em>Maharam Schick </em>YD 141. <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 9:26 leans
            toward permitting one to kosher glassware via <em>hagala</em> and quotes R. Zvi Pesah Frank that one may kosher tempered glass cookware for Pesah,
            but should do so via triple <em>hagala</em>, since according to <em>Itur</em> triple <em>hagala</em> works even for earthenware vessels if
            twenty-four hours have elapsed since their last use. According to these <em>poskim</em>, even those who adopt SA's lenient ruling vis-a-vis
            glassware would agree that any glassware strong enough to withstand the heat of a <em>kli rishon</em> must be koshered via <em>hagala</em>, out of
            concern that these utensils may have absorbed taste at such high temperatures. This is the opinion of <em>Responsa </em><em>Yaskil Avdi</em> 4:14.
            See also <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em> 13:59 for a detailed list of the opinions regarding glassware and 13:375 for the opinions about tempered
            glass cookware.

            . <em>Responsa </em><em>Hatam Sofer </em>YD<em> </em>113 states that enamel is koshered via light <em>libun</em>. R. Shlomo Kluger rules
            stringently that one may not kosher enamel even via <em>libun</em>, since it might get damaged in the process (<em>Tuv Ta'am Va-da'at</em>, first
            edition ï¿½183). <em>Ktav Sofer</em> YD 78 permits koshering enamel via triple <em>hagala</em>. SHT 451:191 quotes <em>Hatam Sofer</em> and then
states that many great authorities were more stringent in this matter when it came to Pesah. This is also the view of <em>Maharsham </em>1:53.            <em>Aderet</em> rules that one may kosher such utensils via <em>hagala</em>, but out of respect for <em>Hatam Sofer</em> states that one should use
            triple <em>hagala</em> (which according to <em>Itur</em> works even for earthenware vessels once twenty-four hours have elapsed since they were
last used). This is also the opinion of AHS YD<em> </em>121:27. R. Mordechai Eliyahu states that one may kosher these utensils for Pesah via            <em>hagala</em>, and preferably triple <em>hagala</em>.

            others. This is also what <em>Hagalat Kelim</em><em> </em>states in 13:91. <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 9:25 assigns greater weight to the
stringent opinions, and states that triple <em>hagala</em> seemingly works according to everyone (based on the opinion of <em>Itur</em> that triple            <em>hagala</em><em> </em>is effective even on earthenware vessels once twenty-four hours have elapsed since their last use, although it seems that
            one needs to change the water between each stage of <em>hagala</em>; see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 9:25 n. 10). It seems proper to wait
            twenty-four hours, ensuring that any absorbed taste is foul, in which case <em>hagala</em> is only rabbinically required, and one may be lenient in
            a case of uncertainty about a rabbinic law.
