<a name="1"></a><h2>1.1 – The Jewish Month</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>
    created luminaries – the sun and the moon – and placed them in the heavens. They are the means by which we establish the order of time. The sun shines
    during the day, the moon at night. The order of years is determined by the cycle of the sun, and the months are based on the moon’s cycle. All of this is
    stated in the Torah:
    <em>
        God said, “Let there be luminaries in the firmament of heaven to separate between the day and the night; and they will be for signs, and for appointed
        times, and for days and years”
    </em>
    (<em>BeReishit</em> 1:14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Every month, the moon makes one orbit around the earth. This cycle is perceivable by the appearance of the moon. At the beginning of the month, the moon
    looks very small to us, like a thin sliver, and it gradually increases until the middle of the month, when it reaches its fullness, appearing as a complete
    circle. During the second half of the month, the moon wanes, until it completely disappears at the end of the month for approximately twenty-four hours.
    Afterwards, it reappears as a thin sliver, indicating that a new month has begun.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A full lunar cycle lasts 29½ days, plus another three-quarters of an hour, roughly speaking.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    Since this cycle does not coincide with the earth’s daily rotation around its axis, due to the extra half-a-day, a Jewish month lasts either twenty-nine or
    thirty days. A 29-day month is called an “incomplete month,” while a 30-day month is called, a “full month.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Establishing the beginning of a month is extremely important, for all of our holidays depend on the Hebrew date: Passover commences on the fifteenth of
    Nissan, Yom Kippur falls out on the tenth of Tishrei, Sukkot begins on the fifteenth of Tishrei, etc. In fact, it is so important that the Torah permits
witnesses who see the new moon to violate the Sabbath in order to travel to Jerusalem and give testimony before the rabbinic court (Rambam,    <em>Kiddush HaChodesh </em>3:2). The court would sanctify the new month based on their testimony and then dispatch messengers to inform all of Israel when
    the new month began.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>1.2 – The Authority to Fix the Months was Entrusted to Israel</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A new month does not automatically begin when the moon reappears. Rather, the judges of the <em>beit din</em> (rabbinic court) sanctify the month, as it
    says, "<em>This month shall be <strong>for you</strong></em>" (<em>Shemot</em> 12:2). HaShem showed Moshe Rabbeinu the configuration of the moon in its
    renewed state and said, “This testimony shall be given over to you” (<em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 22a). That is, witnesses must come before you (the judges) and
    testify that they saw the new moon, and you shall sanctify the month based on their testimony.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    After Moshe Rabbeinu’s death, the authority to establish the Jewish calendar was conferred upon the high court of every generation, on condition that its
judges received rabbinic ordination (<em>semichah</em>) in an unbroken chain from Moshe Rabbeinu; and such ordination can only be transmitted in    <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> (Rambam, <em>Hilchot Sanhedrin</em> 4). If a time comes when the Jews are unable to fix the months by way of a <em>beit din</em>,
    the <em>halachah</em> states that they must do so using mathematical calculations.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Thus, even though the lunar cycle is a natural phenomenon, the renewal of the moon does not, by itself, sanctify the month. Rather, the Jewish people
consecrate the months, and they cause the holiness within time to be revealed. This explains why our Sages decided to end the [middle] blessing of the    <em>Musaf</em> prayer on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> with the words “[Blessed are You, HaShem], Who sanctifies <strong>Israel</strong> and the beginnings of the
    months” (<em>Berachot</em> 49a). Perhaps this is also why the first <em>mitzvah</em> the Torah commanded the Jewish people was the <em>mitzvah</em> of
    sanctifying the new moon (<em>Shemot</em> 12:2), for this <em>mitzvah</em> displays Israel’s unique sanctity – their ability to reveal the holiness within
    time.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>1.3 – The History of the Sanctification of the Moon</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    As a result of Roman persecution, the Jewish settlement in the Holy Land dwindled during the Talmudic period, while the larger community of Jews in
    Babylonia advanced in all areas. Nonetheless, the Sages of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> retained the authority to sanctify months and intercalate years, as it
    says, "<em>For out of Zion Torah will go forth"</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 2:3), and they dispatched messengers every month to inform the Jews residing in the
    Diaspora when the new month began. Only on rare occasions, like during the Beitar revolt, when the situation in the Holy Land was unbearable and the Sages
    could not sanctify the months, judges ordained in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> would leave the Land to a place where the anti-Jewish decrees did not reach and
    establish the order of the months and the years.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Eventually, the Roman decrees intensified, and, as a result of Christian influence, were aimed at the Sages in an attempt to stop them from sanctifying the
months. During this period, the rabbis sometimes had to sanctify a month while in hiding and inform the Sages of Babylonia by way of a secret letter (see    <em>Sanhedrin</em> 12a).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Towards the end of the Talmudic period, Hillel the Second came to the conclusion that the rabbinic courts of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> would no longer be able
    to sanctify the months. There also were fears that hardships and evil decrees would lead to the termination of the institution of <em>semichah</em>. Since
    Hillel himself had the authority to fix the calendar, for he inherited the presidency (<em>Nasi</em>) of the high court in a generational chain from Rabbi
    Yehudah HaNasi, he and his fellow judges took the initiative and calculated the months and years until the end of time and consecrated them. Thus, in the
    year 4119 from creation (359 CE), the Jewish people began to count the months according to the Jewish calendar that R. Hillel HaNasi established. We pray
    that we will soon be privileged to witness the final redemption, when the <em>beit din</em> in Jerusalem will once again sanctify the months.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The Rambam postulates a very novel idea, namely, the sanctification of the months depends on the inhabitants of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, even after    <em>semichah</em> was abolished. That is, when the Jews of the Holy Land calculate the order of the months based on the fixed formula used to establish the
    calendar, then the months are sanctified. If, however, no Jews lived in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, God forbid, the order of the months, along with all the
    holidays, would cease to exist. But God forbid that He should do such a thing, for He has promised us that the remnants of our nation will never be
    destroyed.

<a name="4"></a><h2>1.4 – Rosh Chodesh – One Day or Two? </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    When a month is incomplete (29 days), the following <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is one day. When it is full (30 days), the following <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> lasts
    two days, the first day being the thirtieth of the previous month, and the second day being the first of the next month. Even though the second day is the
    main part of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> – seeing that it is the first day of the month, from which we count the subsequent days of the month – nevertheless, all
the laws of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> apply to the first day, as well. We add the Additional Prayer (<em>Musaf</em>), we recite <em>Hallel</em>, and we insert<em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> into our Silent Prayers and Grace After Meals. One who forgot to say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Shacharit</em> or<em>Minchah</em> must repeat the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. Several explanations have been given for the practice of keeping two days of    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>; see the footnote.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>1.5 – The Status of Rosh Chodesh in the Torah</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Torah lists <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> together with all the other holidays on which we offer additional sacrifices (<em>Musafim</em>) in honor of the day’s
    sanctity. <em>Chazal</em> derive [from a verse in <em>Eichah</em> (1:15)] that <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is also called <em>mo’ed</em> (an appointed time)
    [like all the other holidays] (<em>Pesachim</em> 77a). In Temple times, they used to blow trumpets on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, as it says,
    <em>
        On the day of your gladness, and on your appointed times, and on the beginnings of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings
        and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings
    </em>
    (<em>BeMidbar</em> 10:10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Because of the sanctity of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, a custom developed to go out and greet one’s rabbi, similar to the custom on the Sabbath to say “Shabbat
    Shalom” to the rabbi (II <em>Melachim</em> 4:23, <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 16b, <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> 301:4). There is also a custom to prepare festive
    meals on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> (cf. I <em>Shmuel</em>, chap. 20).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
A wonderful expression is used by the Torah when describing the goat that was sacrificed on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, calling it "    <em>a sin offering for the Lord"</em> (<em>BeMidbar</em> 28:15). The Talmud (<em>Chulin</em> 60b) explains the source of this matter. In the beginning, God
    created two great luminaries in the sky, the sun and the moon. The moon, however, made a claim to the Master of the World: "How can two kings share the
    same crown?" hoping that HaShem would diminish the sun so that it, the moon, could reign supreme. God, however, said to the moon, “Go and reduce yourself.”
    It replied, “Because I made a justified claim before You, I should reduce myself?” God consoled the moon by saying that the Jews would reckon the months
    according to its [cycle], and that the righteous would be called by its name. But the moon was not consoled, so the Holy One Blessed be He said, “Bring an
    atonement for Me, for I diminished the moon.” This is why it says, "<em>And one kid of the goats for a sin offering for the Lord</em>".
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This is a very profound concept, but on a simple level, one could explain that the moon’s reduction symbolizes the deficiencies that exist in creation –
    the descent that the soul undergoes when it arrives in this world and all the failures that man experiences during his lifetime. All these failures and
    deficiencies are prerequisites for subsequent growth, because coping with hardships helps one reach higher heights in the end, as R. Abahu says, “The
    purely righteous cannot stand where penitents stand” (<em>Berachot</em> 34b). In the meantime, though, people commit sins which cause great pain in the
    world. So, in order to relieve the pain and repair the flaws, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> commanded us to sacrifice a goat as a sin offering. This is the
    purpose of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, to show us how a new beginning sprouts from the moon’s reduction, which happened as a result of sin and indictment.
    Therefore, <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is a good time for new beginnings and repentance, and it is a time of profound joy. However, until the world is redeemed
    from all its deficiencies, the joy of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is slightly hidden and is not completely revealed (see also below, sec. 15-16).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>1.6 – Festive Meals on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and the Prohibition to Fast or Grieve</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>
    is among the holidays on which it is appropriate to rejoice. However, there is no explicit commandment to rejoice on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> by way of
    festive meals. Therefore, it is meritorious to have special meals on the day, but one is not obligated to do so (<em>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</em>
    419:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Nevertheless, it is forbidden to grieve on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, and therefore one may not fast on the day (ibid. 418:1). Anyone who refrains from eating
    on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, even for a short period of time, with intention to fast, violates a transgression. But if, by chance, one did not manage to eat
    for several hours, there is no reason for concern (<em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> 418, s.v. <em>assur</em>; <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 3). According to the letter of
    the law, a person who ate only fruits on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is not considered as one who has fasted and transgressed a prohibition; rather, he simply
    failed to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of enjoying festive meals on the day.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The main way to fulfill this <em>mitzvah</em> is by adding a special dish to one’s regular menu in honor of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. This <em>mitzvah</em>
    applies even when <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> coincides with <em>Shabbat</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 418:2, 419:1-2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though one is not obligated to eat bread at a <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> meal, it is virtuous (a <em>mitzvah</em>) to do so (<em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em>
    419:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is proper to set the table respectfully for a <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> meal. Some are meticulous about eating meat and drinking wine at the meal.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> lasts two days, there is a <em>mitzvah</em> to prepare festive meals on both days. This <em>mitzvah</em> is fulfilled mainly
    during the day, but some say that there is a <em>mitzvah</em> to eat larger meals at night, as well.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One is forbidden to do things on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> that evoke sorrow. Therefore, eulogies are forbidden on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. If, however, the
deceased was a Torah Scholar, we eulogize him, but only if the body is present (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 420:1, with    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>; <em>Yoreh De’ah</em> 401:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Similarly, the custom is not to visit cemeteries on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Therefore, if the anniversary of death (<em>yahrtzeit</em>) or the end of    <em>sheloshim</em> (the first thirty days after death) coincides with <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, the friends and relatives of the deceased should visit the
    grave on the day before <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. And if that is impossible, they should go after <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. One is permitted to visit graves of
    the righteous on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> because this does not evoke sorrow.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
A bride and groom who follow the custom of fasting on their wedding day (Ashkenazim and some Sefardim) should not fast if their wedding takes place on    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 573:1).

<a name="7"></a><h2>1.7 – The Custom of Women Refraining from Work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
It is permissible to do work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Ideally, though, one should not work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, as is the law on    <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>, The rule is, the holier the day, the more it is designated for spiritual endeavors, and the more one should decrease his involvement
in work. Thus, all work is forbidden on <em>Shabbat</em>, because it is the holiest day. Work is also forbidden on <em>Yom Tov</em>, a level below    <em>Shabbat</em>, but one is permitted to do things necessary for the preparation of food. <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em> is the following level, and only certain
    acts are forbidden. <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> should rightfully be on par with <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>, but since the Twelve Tribes sinned in the episode of the
    Golden Calf, Israel lost, correspondingly, the special quality of the twelve <em>Roshei Chodeshim</em> of the year. Women, however, did not participate in
the sin of the Calf, refusing to give their nose-rings in order to create it. Therefore, God gave them reward in this world – “They keep    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> more than the men do” – and in the world to come, for they will eventually regain their youthfulness, like the moon which renews
itself [every month], as it says, "<em>Who satisfies your ornament</em> [i.e. body or soul]    <em> with goodness, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle</em>" (<em>Tehillim</em> 103:5) (<em>Pirkei DeRebbe Eliezer</em> 45). As a result, women
    absorb more of the sanctity of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>; and they have adopted the custom not to do work on the day.
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Actually, when the Temple stood and [the <em>kohanim</em>] offered <em>Musaf</em> sacrifices, some men also had the custom to refrain from doing major work
    on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. But their custom has no binding force, because they committed the sin of the Calf. Women, on the other hand, who did not sin,
    have more of a connection to the sanctity of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and their custom has validity.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Therefore, every woman must refrain from doing some type of work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> – knitting, for example – in order to differentiate between    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and an ordinary day. It goes without saying that she may not plan to do any big jobs on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Meticulous women refrain from doing any type of work that is forbidden on <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>. This includes sewing, knitting, and fixing things in the
    house. Cooking, baking, and ironing, however, are permitted, as they are on <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>. Washing clothing in a washing machine is also permitted,
    because it entails almost no effort. If the clothes are needed for <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> itself, one may wash them even by hand. A woman who works for a
living is permitted to work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, even if she follows the custom of the meticulous ones, for if she misses work regularly on    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, she might lose her job. And even if there is no concern of being fired, she may go to work if she needs the money or if her absence
    will cause damage to her employer.

<a name="8"></a><h2>1.8 – Shabbat Mevarchim (Blessing the New Month)</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
On the <em>Shabbat</em> before <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, the custom is to announce the day(s) on which the new month will fall and pray that “    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> renew it for us and all of Israel for goodness and blessing.” In a certain way, this also commemorates the sanctification of
the new moon that the <em>beit din</em> used to perform. Therefore, the custom is to announce the exact time at which the new moon will appear (the<em>molad</em>). This is also why we stand during the ceremony, because the people used to stand before the <em>beit din</em> when it performed the    <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Kiddush HaChodesh</em>. There is only one <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> before which we do not bless the new month – Tishrei, for everyone
    knows it’s coming, because <em>Rosh Chodesh Tishrei</em> is also the holiday of <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We announce the coming of the new month specifically on <em>Shabbat</em> because that is when the entire congregation is gathered in the synagogue, and
    everyone will hear when <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is slated to fall out. Furthermore, all the days of the week receive blessing from <em>Shabbat</em>, and even
    the sanctity of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> flows from the <em>Shabbat</em> that precedes it. Therefore, we bless the new month on that day. This is why we begin
    to feel on that <em>Shabbat</em> the festiveness of the forthcoming <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>.

</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>1.9 – A Time of Atonement and Yom Kippur Katan</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>Rosh Chodesh </em>
    is a time of atonement, as we say in the <em>Musaf</em> prayer, “A time of atonement for all [the Jewish people’s] offspring.” In addition, when the Temple
    stood, they would sacrifice a he-goat as a sin offering.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In order to make this atonement complete, pious Jews customarily repent in preparation for <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Some people fast on the eve of    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and recite special “Yom Kippur Katan” prayers prior to the <em>Mincha</em> service. The day before <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is called
    “Yom Kippur Katan” (the Minor Day of Atonement) because it is a time to atone for the sins of the previous month, just as Yom Kippur is a time to atone for
    the sins of the previous year (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 417:4, <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 10-21). Nowadays, few people follow the custom of fasting;
    instead, one should study more Torah and give extra charity.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>1.10 – Ya’aleh VeYavo in Shemoneh Esrei</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The unique nature of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> must find expression in our prayers. After all, <em>Chazal</em> instituted our prayers in place of the
sacrifices, and the Torah commands us to offer a <em>musaf</em> sacrifice on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Therefore, the Rabbis prescribed that we recite the<em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> prayer, in which we beseech God to remember us for good on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. They inserted it in the blessing of “<em>Retzeh</em>” because that is where we ask God to restore the divine service to the Holy Temple, and that is an appropriate place to mention<em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, for once the divine service is restored we will be able to offer the <em>musaf</em> of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. One who forgets to say    <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Shacharit</em> or <em>Mincha</em> must repeat the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 24a).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
If one remembers immediately after completing the blessing of <em>Retzeh</em>, he should insert <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> there, and then continue with    <em>Modim</em>. If one already began <em>Modim</em>, but remembered before moving his feet back at the end of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, he should return to
    the beginning of <em>Retzeh</em> and continue from there until the end. The preceding is true only regarding <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Mincha</em>, but if
one forgot to say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Ma’ariv</em>, he does not go back, unless he remembers before saying God’s name at the conclusion of    <em>Retzeh</em>. The reason <em>Ma’ariv</em> is different is that the <em>beit din</em> did not sanctify the new moon at night. Thus, even though one
    should, ideally, say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Ma’ariv</em>, he does not repeat the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, or even just one blessing, in order to
    say it (<em>Berachot</em> 29b, 30b; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 422:1).

</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>1.11 - Ya’aleh VeYavo in Grace After Meals</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
One must say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> (Grace After Meals), as well. Even though one is not obligated to eat a meal on    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, one must mention it when reciting <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> because of the importance of the day, which requires additional
    sacrifices (<em>Shabbat</em> 24a with <em>Tosafot</em>). <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> is inserted in the blessing of <em>Rachem</em>, because both are prayers
    of supplication.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If one forgot to say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>, he need not repeat the prayer because one who forgets to mention the sanctity of
a particular day must repeat <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> only on days when there is an obligation to eat a meal with bread, like <em>Shabbat</em> and    <em>Yom Tov</em>. On <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and <em>Chol HaMoed</em>, however, one is not obligated to eat such a meal. Therefore, from the perspective of
the sanctity of the day, one need not recite <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> at all. Consequently, one need not repeat it if he accidentally omitted    <em>Ya’aleh VaYavo</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 424:1).
    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>

<p dir="LTR">
    One who began a meal on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, and managed to eat a <em>kezayit</em> (olive-size) of bread before sunset, must say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>
in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>, even if he continued eating long after nightfall (“when the stars emerge”), because the meal began on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 188:10; some argue, see <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 43).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
If one began to eat on the eve of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, and finished his meal after nightfall, he must say <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>, provided that he ate a    <em>kezayit</em> of bread after <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> began (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 271:6, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 29).

<a name="12"></a><h2>1.12 – Hallel on Rosh Chodesh </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is a widespread custom among the Jews to recite <em>Hallel</em> on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Indeed, according to the letter of the law there is no
    obligation to do so, because <em>Hallel</em> is required only on days that: a) are called <em>mo’ed</em> (appointed times), and b) are prohibited from
    work. Granted, <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is called a <em>mo’ed</em>, but work is permitted on the day. Still, the Jewish people have accepted the practice of
    saying <em>Hallel</em> on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, in order to give expression to the sanctity of the day, which is capable of elevating one to the level of
    singing God’s praises. To make it clear that the <em>Hallel</em> of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is custom-based and not obligatory, we omit two paragraphs that
    are said when reciting the complete <em>Hallel</em> (the complete <em>Hallel</em> consists of chapters 113-118 of <em>Tehillim</em>, and we skip 115:1-11
    and 116:1-11).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Rishonim</em> argue about the blessing. The Rambam and Rashi hold that no blessing is said on the <em>Rosh Chodesh Hallel</em>, since it is only
    based on a custom, and we do not recite blessings upon the fulfillment of customs. Rabbeinu Tam, the Rosh, and the Ran, however, maintain that we do make
blessings over important customs, such as reciting the <em>Hallel</em>. In practice, the Ashkenazi custom is to recite a blessing, even if one says the    <em>Hallel</em> in private. The Sefardim who hail from <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and its surroundings never say a blessing on this<em> Hallel</em>. The custom
    of most North African Sefardim is that the cantor recites the blessing – both before and after <em>Hallel</em> – aloud, in order to absolve the
    congregation of their obligation. But one who prays alone does not recite a blessing. Each person should continue to follow his or her custom.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should try to say <em>Hallel</em> with a <em>minyan</em>. According to many <em>poskim</em>, one who comes late to services and finds the congregation
saying <em>Hallel</em> should say it with them and only afterwards begin <em>Pesukei DeZimrah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 422:16 and    <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 422:8; the Kaf HaChayim [422:38], however, cites the Ari as saying that one should not pray out of order).

</p>
<a name="13"></a><h2>1.13 – Customs Relating to the Reading of Hallel</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must stand while reciting the <em>Hallel</em>, because <em>Hallel</em> is a testimony to God’s glory, and witnesses must stand while testifying. After
    the fact, if one said <em>Hallel</em> sitting or lying down, he has nonetheless fulfilled his obligation. Someone who is ill and cannot stand may say it
    sitting or lying down from the outset (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 422:7, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 28).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should not interrupt the recitation of <em>Hallel</em>, even by just remaining silent. In the case of a pressing need, however, like preventing an
insult, one may interrupt. One may also interrupt <em>Hallel</em> in order to recite “holy responses” [like <em>Kedushah</em>, <em>Kadish</em>, and    <em>Barachu</em>]. One should say <em>Hallel</em> in order, from beginning to end. One who said it out of order has not fulfilled his obligation and must
    go back to the place where he erred and read it in order (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 422:4-6). It is proper to read <em>Hallel</em> slowly and pleasantly, and
    many congregations have a custom to sing parts of it.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Our Sages ordained that <em>Hallel</em> be said immediately after the morning prayers (<em>Shacharit</em>). After all, we mention the uniqueness of    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> in the Silent Prayer, by saying <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>. Therefore, it is appropriate to [immediately] continue praising God and
    thanking Him for sanctifying the Jewish people and the New Moons. Under extenuating circumstances, one may say it later in the day, because, according to
    the letter of the law, the entire day is suitable for the reading of <em>Hallel</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 20b).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are various customs regarding how to recite the <em>Hallel</em> – which verses are repeated twice, which verses are said responsively, etc. All the
    customs are good, and every community should continue following its custom (<em>Sukkah</em> 38a-39a, <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 422:3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Customarily, the cantor reads four verses aloud (<em>Tehillim</em> 118:1-4): 1) הודו לה' כי טוב כי לעולם חסדו –<em>Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for His kindness endures forever.</em> 2) יאמר נא ישראל כי לעולם חסדו –<em>Let Israel say now, “For His kindness endures forever.”</em> 3) יאמרו נא בית אהרן כי לעולם חסדו –<em>Let the House of Aharon say now, “For His kindness endures forever.”</em> 4) יאמרו נא יראי ה' כי לעולם חסדו –    <em>Let those who fear the Lord say now, “For His kindness endures forever.”</em> According to Ashkenazi custom, the congregation responds,הודו לה' כי טוב
    כי לעולם חסדו to each of these verses. According to the Sefardic custom, however, the congregation repeats each verse after the cantor.
    <button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Regarding the duplication of verses, it has become the accepted custom, in the last few generations, to repeat all the verses from אודך until the end of    <em>Hallel</em> (<em>Tehillim</em> 118:21-29). The reason we say these verses twice: the beginning of the chapter repeats every idea twice, but from אודך
    on, the verses cease repeating themselves. We, however, continue the pattern of the psalm and double up the rest of the verses. Furthermore, David, his
    father Yishai, and his brothers composed these verses, as the Talmud relates (<em>Pesachim</em> 119a). Thus, because of their importance, [<em>Chazal</em>]
    wanted us to say them twice.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We read the verse, אנא ה' הושיעה נא, אנא ה' הצליחה נא – <em>"Please, O Lord, save us; Please, O Lord, make us successful"</em> (<em>Tehillim</em> 118:25),
    in a special way, saying the first part twice and then the second part twice.

<a name="14"></a><h2>1.14 – The Torah Reading and Musaf Service </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
In honor of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> we call up four people to the Torah. The reading begins with the daily burnt offering and ends with the special    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> sacrifices (<em>BeMidbar</em> 28:1-15). This hints to the fact that the fixed and continual sanctity that manifests itself in the
    daily burnt offering, which was sacrificed every morning and afternoon, is able to elicit the special sanctity of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, which incorporates
    renewal, atonement, and repentance.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    After the Torah reading and the recitation of <em>Ashrei</em> and <em>U’Va LeTzion</em> (and according to some Sefardim, <em>Beit Ya’akov</em> and the
    daily psalm, as well), we say the Silent Prayer of <em>Musaf</em>. This prayer is comprised of the usual opening and closing blessings, three each, with
    one middle blessing about <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, which concludes, “[Blessed are You, HaShem], Who sanctifies Israel and the beginnings of the months.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Our Sages instituted the <em>Musaf</em> service in place of the additional (<em>musaf</em>) sacrifices that were offered [in the Holy Temple] on    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. The time frame of this prayer also corresponds to that of the additional sacrifices. Thus, one must pray <em>Musaf</em> by the end
    of the seventh hour of the day, calculating each “hour” as one-twelfth of daylight. One who procrastinates and fails to pray by this time is considered a
    sinner. Nevertheless, he should pray afterwards, because, ex post facto, one may offer the additional sacrifices all day long (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    286:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The custom is to remove one’s <em>tefillin</em> before the <em>Musaf</em> prayer. On <em>Yom Tov</em> (major Jewish holidays) we do not wear    <em>tefillin</em> at all; since the day itself is a “sign” between God and Israel, we do not need the additional “sign” of <em>tefillin</em>. Similarly,
the <em>Musaf</em> prayer on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is considered a “sign;” therefore, we do not need the additional “sign” of <em>tefillin</em> (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 423:4, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 10). The custom is to remove them after the <em>kaddish</em> that precedes <em>Musaf</em>. It is
    proper to start praying only after the <em>tefillin</em> are completely wrapped in their straps and stored away in their bags. Otherwise, they will lie
    there disgracefully throughout the <em>Musaf</em> service.
    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Another prevalent custom is to say the psalm beginning with <em>Borchi Nafshi</em> (<em>Tehillim</em> 104) during <em>Shacharit</em>, because it contains
the verse <em>He made the moon for appointed festivals</em>. Some believe that the Levites recited this psalm in the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> on    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> (<em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 423:5).

<a name="15"></a><h2>1.15 – The Meaning Behind the Blessing of the Moon</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the Blessing of the Moon (<em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>), we thank HaShem for creating the moon, from whose light we benefit at night. Multitudes of Jewish
    worshipers have attached special honor and affection to this blessing, for it alludes to deep concepts concerning the Jewish people. We will explain some
    of these:
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Of all the heavenly bodies, the moon is most similar to us. Just as a person’s life is filled with ups and downs, so too, the moon waxes and wanes. In the
    middle of the month, it looks full, but as it nears the end of the month it dwindles and disappears. And just as man conceded to his pride and desires and
    ate from the Tree of Knowledge and was punished, so too, the moon was not satisfied being equally as luminous as the sun, asking instead to rule over it
    (see above, sec. 5). In retribution for the moon’s arrogance, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> reduced its light and even created the lunar cycle in which it
    decreases every month, eventually disappearing for an entire day. However, unlike man, who fades away and dies, the moon is part of the heavenly hosts and
    is fixed and everlasting, always regenerating itself. The Jewish people have the exact same qualities. On the one hand, they lead normal human lives, which
    include ups and downs, and good inclinations as well as evil ones. On the other hand, their connection to faith and God is everlasting. Therefore, unlike
    other nations, <em>Am Yisrael</em> endures forever. We connect to this idea of Israel’s immortality in <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>, when we see the moon
    reappear and grow every month.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Moreover, not only do we manage to survive despite all the hardships, we actually advance to a higher level as a result of each crisis and setback. King
    David taught us how to transform each setback into an impetus for greater growth. <em>Chazal</em> tell us that David was the lowliest of his brothers,
    growing up in the fields among the animals, but he, prudently, matured and improved from every experience. Even after his difficult fall in the sin of
Bat-Sheva, he did not despair. Rather, he repented completely, to the point where <em>Chazal</em> say that “he established the yoke of repentance” (    <em>Mo’ed Kattan</em> 16b). David transformed his awful failure into tremendous self-improvement, and ever since then we learn from him the ways of
    repentance and how powerful it truly is. By virtue of his repentance, David’s kingdom is everlasting, just like the moon which always rejuvenates after its
    decline.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This is why David’s kingdom is compared to the moon, and it is also why we say in the <em>Kiddush Levanah</em> ceremony, “David, King of Israel, lives and
    endures.” The Jewish people, as well, grow from every setback, rectifying all their sins and blemishes, until they will eventually be privileged to perfect
    the world through God’s sovereignty. At that time, the moon, which symbolizes our situation in the world, will also return to its perfected state, when its
    light will be as bright as the sun’s. Thus, we beseech [God] in <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>, “It (the moon) should renew itself [like] a crown of glory for
    those borne from the womb (the people of Israel), who will eventually renew themselves like it and glorify their Maker for the sake of His glorious
    kingdom.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some have a custom to add the following request: “May it be Your will, Lord my God and God of my forefathers, to repair the moon’s defect, that there be no
    deficiency in it. Let the light of the moon be like the light of the sun and like the light of the seven days of creation, as it was before it was reduced,
as it says, "<em>The two great luminaries"</em> (<em>BeReishit</em> 1:16). And may the following verse be fulfilled through us: "    <em>They shall seek the Lord their God and David their king"</em> (<em>Hoshe’a</em> 3:5). Amen.

</p>
<a name="16"></a><h2>1.16 – The Laws of Reciting the Blessing Joyously</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Because of the lofty idea that the moon’s renewal represents, the Blessing of the Moon has been hallowed to the point that one who recites it is considered
    as one who receives God’s Presence (the <em>Shechinah</em>). Thus, Tanna D’vei Rebbi Yishma’el states, “Had the Jews been privileged to greet their Father
    in Heaven only once a month (when reciting <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>), it would be sufficient” (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 42a). Therefore, Abaye concluded that
    one must honor the blessing and recite it while standing (Sanhedrin 42:a.). One who finds it difficult to stand should lean on his cane or a friend and
    recite the blessing. And if leaning is too difficult, he may say it while sitting.
    <button type="button" id="1022" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 22</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom is to honor the blessing by saying it with a <em>minyan</em>. In the absence of a <em>minyan</em>, it is best to say it in a group of three, but
    according to the letter of the law one may recite it alone. If one is concerned that waiting for a day on which a <em>minyan</em> can be gathered will
    cause him to forget to say the blessing altogether, it is preferable [not to wait and] to say it alone (<em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> 426:2, s.v. <em>ella</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is customary to exit one's house and recite the blessing under the open sky. After all, we learned above that <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> is compared to
    greeting the <em>Shechinah</em>. Therefore, just as one goes out to greet a king, one should go out to recite this blessing. One who is sick or fearful
    that he might catch a cold if he ventures outside may look at the moon through a window and say the blessing indoors (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:21).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In order to honor the blessing, which entails an aspect of greeting the <em>Shechinah</em>, we are accustomed to saying it immediately after    <em>Shabbat</em>, when we are joyful and dressed nicely. However, if there is reason to fear that waiting until Saturday night will cause us to miss the
    opportunity to say the blessing altogether, it is preferable to say it on a weeknight (<em>Shulchan Aruch, Rama</em> 426:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The custom is not to recite <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> on Friday night, in order to avoid mingling the joy of <em>Shabbat</em> with that of    <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>. However, if there is reason to fear that one will miss the blessing if he does not say it on Friday night, he should recite it
    then (<em>Rama</em> 426:2, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 12).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    As we already learned, the moon alludes to <em>Kenesset Yisrael</em> (the Assembly of Israel). Now, <em>Kenesset Yisrael</em> is like a bride before God,
and “she” renews and purifies herself every month, just like a bride does for her husband. This strengthens the bond between <em>Kenesset Yisrael</em> and    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>. And when all of the world’s flaws are remedied, everyone will recognize the special relationship that exists between Israel
    and the Holy One Blessed be He, as it says, "<em>Like a bridegroom rejoices over a bride, so will your God rejoice over you</em>" (<em>Yeshayah</em> 62:5).
    Therefore, a custom developed to dance and sing after <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>. Along the same lines, there is a custom to raise oneself up a bit when
    saying, “Just as I dance before You…” (<em>Rama</em> 426:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Since we must say the blessing joyously, we do not to recite it before <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> – because of our mourning over the Temple’s destruction – or    <em>Yom Kippur</em>, due to the anxiety of the upcoming Day of Judgment. We do say it, however, immediately after <em>Yom Kippur</em>, even though we have
    not yet eaten, because we are joyous over having had the privilege to stand before God in penitence. It is proper to push off <em>Kiddush Levanah</em>
    until the night after <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, or until people have had a chance to eat and drink and leave their state of mourning (<em>Rama</em> 426:2).
However, if it will be difficult to gather a <em>minyan</em> later on, a congregation may sanctify the moon immediately after the fast is over (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:11, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 9; see also below 10:19).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, one who is sitting <em>shiva</em> should push off reciting the blessing until after <em>shiva</em>, if possible, even if he will have to say it
    alone, because he is grieving. If, however, he cannot push it off – because <em>shiva</em> will end after the permissible time to say the blessing – he
    should say it during his mourning period (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:11, <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 5; the latest time to recite the blessing will be
    elucidated below, sec. 18).
</p>
<a name="17"></a><h2>1.17 – Seeing the New Moon </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We bless the new moon at night, because that is when it is clearly visible and one can benefit from its light. One may not recite the blessing if he sees
    the moon at twilight, because the sun’s light is still shining and one does not benefit from the light of the moon at that time (<em>Rama</em> 426:1).
    Before reciting the blessing, one must look at the moon for a moment in order to derive pleasure from its light, but the custom is not to look at the moon
    when actually reciting the blessing (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:13, <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 34). If one recites the blessing when the moon is covered by
    clouds he has not fulfilled his obligation, because he cannot benefit from its light. However, if it is covered only by a thin cloud, and one can see
    things that are usually visible by the light of the moon, he may say the blessing. Nevertheless, it is best to bless the moon when it is clearly visible,
    with no obstruction. Some authorities write that it is preferable to postpone <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> in such a situation, but according to the letter of
    the law, one may recite the blessing even if a thin cloud passes underneath the moon, since one can derive benefit from its light. It seems [to me] that as
    long as one can discern the outline of the moon [through the cloud], it is permissible to recite the blessing.
    <button type="button" id="1023" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 23</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If, while reciting the blessing, the moon becomes completely covered [by clouds], one should continue saying the blessing. However, if one estimates that
    while reciting the blessing a big cloud will come and cover the moon completely, he should not start the blessing, because ideally (<em>le’chatchilah</em>)
    the entire blessing must be said when the moon is in view (Ridbaz 1:346; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:2; <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em>, s.v. <em>nehenin</em>).
    <button type="button" id="1024" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 24</button>
</p>
<a name="18"></a><h2>1.18 – The Proper Time for <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em></h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many <em>Rishonim</em> hold that the time for <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> starts on the first day the moon is visible, and that the earlier one says the
    blessing the better (Rambam, <em>Hilchot Berachot</em> 10:17; Rosh; and others). Several <em>poskim</em>, however, posit that it is preferable to wait
    until the moon grows a bit, when it is possible to benefit from its light. Some say one should wait until three whole days pass, for that is when the
    moon’s light is useable (R. Sa’adya Gaon, Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah), while others say seven days must pass, because that is when one can truly benefit from
    its light (Rama of Panow, <em>Responsa</em> 78). According to some of the greatest Kabbalists – most notably, R. Yosef Gikitilla – one should wait seven
    days, for Kabbalistic reasons. They explain that the renewal of the moon’s light alludes to man’s renewal, and whenever there is a new development there is
    concern that the Attribute of Justice might prosecute and hinder the new growth. Therefore, it is proper to wait seven days, like the seven days of
    creation, for by then the moon’s light has stabilized and [the Attribute of Justice] can no longer prosecute against the new beginning.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sefardim and Chassidim are accustomed not to recite the blessing before the seventh of the month (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 426:4), while Ashkenazim say it
    after three days (Bach, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:20). In actuality, though, the custom is to bless the new moon on Saturday night, in order to say the
    blessing joyously, while wearing nice clothing. Thus, practically speaking, Ashkenazim and Moroccan Jews recite <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> on the Saturday
    night that follows three whole days after the <em>molad</em> (the “rebirth” of the moon), while Sefardim and Chassidim say it on the first Saturday night
    after the seventh of the month.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
There is a dispute regarding how to act when the seventh of the month begins on a Saturday night, but seven complete days from the time of the    <em>molad</em> [168 hours] have not yet passed. Some authorities hold that we postpone the blessing until the next night or the next Saturday night, which
    will fall out on the fourteenth of the month (Rashash, R. Zalman of Liadi, <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 426:61). Others contend that even if a few hours remain
    until the end of the seventh day from the <em>molad</em>, one may say <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> (<em>Kenesset HaGedolah</em>, <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em>
    2:24). If people from different ethnic backgrounds pray together and the seventh of the month falls out on a Saturday night, it is proper for everyone to
    recite <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>, for that is what the majority of <em>poskim</em> hold.
    <button type="button" id="1025" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 25</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who failed to say <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> by the seventh of the month can say it until the end of the night of the fifteenth, because the moon is
still full until then. Afterwards, however, it begins to wane; therefore, the blessing cannot be said from the night of the sixteenth and onward (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 426:3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Preferably, one should take into account the opinion of the Maharil, who holds that one may not say <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> after half of the moon’s
    cycle has elapsed (14 days, 18 hours, and approximately 20 minutes, from the time of the <em>molad</em>). This time rarely passes the beginning of the
night of the fourteenth. By the night of the fifteenth, the moon’s cycle sometimes reaches the halfway mark, and sometimes not (<em>Rama</em> 426:3,    <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 53). Nevertheless, in practice, one who did not say the blessing by the fourteenth may say it until the end of the night of the
    fifteenth (<em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> 426:3, <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 8:42).

            If witnesses who saw the new moon on the night of the thirtieth come before the <em>beit din</em> the next day, the court would sanctify the month
            on that day, transforming the thirtieth day of the previous month into the first day of the new month, <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. They would then
            immediately offer up the special <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> sacrifices. Consequently, the previous month would become an incomplete one, having only
            twenty-nine days. If, however, no witnesses arrive on that day (the thirtieth), it is clear that <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> will the next day – the
            thirty-first – and the previous month was a full one, consisting of thirty days. In such a case, there is no need for the <em>beit din</em> to
            accept witnesses or declare the beginning of the new month, for in any case there are only two possible days on which <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> can
fall, and if no witnesses come on the first day, <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> will [automatically] fall out on the next day (Rambam,            <em>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</em> 2:8).

            The main idea is taken from the Rambam’s <em>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</em> 5:1-3.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>, Positive Commandment 153, the Rambam writes that the sanctification of the months is entrusted to the highest rabbinic
            court. The Ramban, however, claims that a <em>beit din</em> of three will suffice. One could say that there is no argument here, for the Rambam
            means to say that the months are sanctified by virtue of the foremost court of the generation, [not that they actually have to do it].
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            [As stated above], the months were sanctified primarily in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, and only in dire circumstances did the greatest rabbis of the
            generation, who were ordained in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, leave the Land in order to sanctify the months without interference from the kingdom. This
            is derived from a passage in <em>Berachot</em> 63a:
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
When Chanina, R. Yehoshua’s nephew, went down to the Diaspora (after the Beitar revolt), he intercalated years and established months in            <em>Chutz LaAretz</em>. [The rabbis of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>] sent two Torah scholars after him – R. Yosi ben Kippar and the grandson of
            Zechariyah ben Kevutal. When he saw them, he said, “Why have you come?” They replied, “We have come to learn Torah.” He proclaimed, “These men are
            [among] the greatest rabbis of the generation, and their forefathers served in the Holy Temple…” He began declaring [things] impure while they
            declared [them] pure. He forbade [certain acts] and they permitted [them]. [So] he announced, “These men are worthless; they are empty.” They said
            to him, “You already built [us] up; you can no longer knock [us] down. You already built a fence; you can no longer breach it.” He responded, “Why
            is it that whenever I declare [something] impure you declare [it] pure; whenever I forbid [something] you permit [it]?” They answered, “Because you
            are intercalating years and establishing months outside the Land of Israel.” He said, “Didn’t Akiva ben Yosef intercalate years and establish
months in <em>Chutz LaAretz</em>?” They replied, “Leave aside [the case of] Rabbi Akiva, for he did not leave behind anyone like him in            <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.” He said to them, “I, too, left no one behind like me in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.” They answered, “The kid-goats you left
            behind have become he-goats with horns, and they sent us to you, and this is what they told us, ‘Go, tell him in our names [to desist]. If he
            listens – fine. But if he does not – excommunicate him. And tell our brethren in the Diaspora [to desist as well]. If they listen – fine. But if
            not – let them go up to the mountain, [where] Achiyah will build an altar and Chananyah will play the harp, and everyone will deny [God], saying,
            “We have no portion in the God of Israel.” [Upon hearing this], the entire congregation immediately burst into tears and said, “God forbid! We do
have a portion in the God of Israel.” And why all the fuss [not to establish the calendar in <em>Chutz LaAretz</em>]? Because it says, "            <em>For out of Zion Torah will go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem"</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 2:3).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            We stated above that when no ordained rabbis exist, the months are sanctified by way of mathematical calculations. According to the Rambam, this is
            a <em>halachah l'Moshe m'Sinai</em> (a law given over to Moshe, by God, at Mt. Sinai). This is why he does not mention R. Hillel HaNasi [in his
            discussion on the topic]. The Ramban, on the other hand, writes that there is no source for such a <em>halachah l'Moshe m'Sinai</em>. Rather, the
            truth is that in our times, as well, the months are sanctified by ordained rabbis – that is, based on R. Hillel’s calculations. Consequently, the
            Ramban does not require that there be Jews living in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> so that the calculations can apply to them, for he holds that the
            months are not established based on the calculations of those currently living in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, rather, upon R. Hillel’s ancient
            calculations. See <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 417:7.

Seemingly, one could ask: <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> means the first day of month; why then is the thirtieth day of a full month also considered<em>Rosh Chodesh</em>? The Shibolei HaLeket (168) quoting Rabbeinu Shlomo and the Rid (the earlier R. Yeshayah), as well as the author of            <em>Birkei Yosef</em> (427), explain that when a month is full, the new moon appears in the middle of the thirtieth day (after 29½ days).
            Therefore, even though the next day will be the first of the month (in order to balance out the months, as explained above – 1.1), nonetheless, it
            is fitting to treat also the day on which the moon reappears as <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. This is why we keep two days of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Tashbetz (3:244) writes that [the Jews in ancient times] used to refrain from work and prepare festive meals in honor of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>,
            and they would begin doing so already on the thirtieth day of the month, in the eventuality that witnesses arrive and the <em>beit din</em>
            declares that day the first of the month. And if no one came to testify, they treated the next day, as well, as <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Thus,
            whenever a month was full, they kept two days of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> (similar to <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Even though the <em>Musaf</em> sacrifices were offered up exclusively on the first of the month, these two explanations indicate that both days are
            holy, and we therefore say <em>Hallel</em>, <em>Musaf</em>, and <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> on both days.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Rabbi Zevin writes in <em>LeOr HaHalachah</em> (in an essay on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>) that according to Rashi and the Shiltei Giborim (<em>Rosh HaShanah</em>, chap. 1), Jews used to keep one day of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> on a full month, while the Or Zarua (vol. 2,            <em>Hilchot Rosh Chodesh</em>) and the Maharsha (<em>Bava Metzia</em> 59b) maintain that they kept two days.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            These authorities also disagree on how to interpret a verse in the First Book of <em>Shmuel</em> (20:27): ויהי ממחרת החדש השני. The Tashbetz and
            Rabbeinu Yeshayah understand it as a reference to the second day of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, while Rashi, and the Radak, say that it refers to the
            day after <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, a regular day.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some say that we observe two days because we are unsure which day is truly <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. This opinion, however, has been rejected.
Therefore, one who forgets to recite <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Shacharit</em> or <em>Minchah</em>, on either day, must repeat the            <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em>, chap. 10, note 4.

A goat was brought as a sin offering on all the holidays, but no where else does it say, <em>a sin offering for the Lord</em>. The other<em>musaf</em> (additional) sacrifices offered on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> were: two bullocks, one ram, and seven sheep as a wholly-burnt offering (            <em>BeMidbar</em> 28:11).

            Rashi states in <em>Ta’anit</em> (15b), “Even though it is called a <em>mo’ed</em> (appointed festival), [the Torah] does not call it a day of
            feasting and joy.” The Rosh (<em>Berachot</em> 7:23) concurs, stating that we do not insert the word <em>simchah</em> (joy) into the corrective
            blessing for Grace After Meals [on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>] (see below note 14). In contrast, the author of <em>Sefer Yirei’im</em> (227) writes,
            “One is obligated to rejoice on [<em>Rosh Chodesh</em>],” albeit one is not obligated to eat bread at the meal, because one can satisfy the
            requirement of joy by eating meat and drinking wine. The final <em>halachah</em> remains as stated above.

            The Rambam holds that the prohibition of fasting on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is derived from the Torah, while the Beit Yosef (418) maintains that it
            is a Rabbinic decree. Pious individuals have a custom to fast on two specific <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> days –<em> </em>the first of <em>Nissan</em>,
            because Aharon’s sons died then, and the first of<em> Av</em>, on which Aharon died (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>580:2). The Rama comments (ibid.
            580:1) that one should not fast an entire <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, rather he should eat before the stars emerge. A regular person should not accept
            upon himself to fast on these days of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 14:13-14.

The custom to embellish the <em>mitzvah</em> by setting the table respectfully is cited in <em>Ben Ish Chai</em> (<em>Shanah bet</em>,            <em>VaYikra</em> 10) and <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> (419:5). Eating meat and drinking wine is also an embellishment in honor of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>.
            According to <em>Sefer Yirei’im</em>, however, it is an actual <em>mitzvah</em>, as mentioned in the previous note. This is why most Sefardic Jews
            refrain from eating meat and drinking wine only from the second day of the month of Av, in order to uphold the honor of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. The
            Ashkenazi custom is to refrain from meat and wine on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> Av, as well (see below 8:13). Also see <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em>,

            According to the Rama (573:1) and the Mishnah Berurah (ibid. 9), they should fast on <em>Rosh Chodesh Nissan</em>, because the pious have a custom
            to fast on that day [anyway]. The Pri Megadim maintains that one who does not usually fast on <em>Rosh Chodesh Nissan</em> should not do so on his
            or her wedding day. See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 14:19. In footnote 39 (ibid.), the author discusses the case of a wedding that takes place on
            the [first] night of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> [when the bride and groom surely fast during the day prior to the wedding]. He explains that according
            to the Aruch HaShulchan (<em>Even HaEzer</em> 61:21), who holds that brides and grooms fast in order to ensure that they are not drunk at their
            wedding, they should continue fasting until after the <em>chuppah</em>, even though this will mean that they are entering <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> in
            an afflicted state. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (146:1), on the other hand, maintains that brides and grooms always fast only until nightfall,
            because the purpose of the fast is to procure atonement.

            This is how Pirkei DeRebbe Eliezer (45), the Tur (<em>Orach Chayim</em> 417), the Perishah (ibid. 1), and the Darkei Moshe (ibid. 1), quoting the
            Or Zaru’a, explain the issue. See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em>, beginning of chap. 11, where the author recounts all the reasons given for this
            matter. R. Chayim Vital explains in <em>Sha’ar HaKavanot</em> (76b) that women correspond to [the <em>sefirah</em> of] <em>Malchut</em> (Kingship)
            and the moon, which renew themselves, while men correspond to <em>Tiferet</em> (Beauty), which does not. (Furthermore, <em>Malchut</em> undergoes a
decline, from which it can reach even higher than <em>Tiferet</em>. A hint for this is <em>[A virtuous woman is] the crown of her husband</em> [            <em>Mishlei</em> 12:4].)

            The Tur and Beit Yosef (<em>Orach Chayim</em> 417) explain that the main source for this custom is a <em>Yerushalmi</em> (<em>Ta’anit</em> 1:6):
            “Those women who are accustomed not to work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> – it is a custom.” According to Rabbeinu Yerucham, a woman who never had such
            a custom need not take it on. However, the Bi’ur Halachah (417, s.v. <em>ve’hanashim</em>) writes that most <em>Rishonim</em> hold that all women
            must keep this custom, but they can satisfy their obligation by refraining from any type of work. If, however, they have a more stringent custom,
            forbidding additional types of work, their custom is binding. Indeed, there are those who act more stringently, and I referred to them as
            “meticulous ones.” The Eshel Avraham of Buchach says that even the meticulous ones should not treat <em>Rosh Chodesh </em>more stringently than
            they do <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>. Therefore, washing clothes for the sake of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is permitted, because the reason for the
prohibition on <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em> is only to ensure that people wash their clothes in anticipation of the holiday. Regarding washing machines:            <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> (11:7) writes that there are those who are stringent, but that R. Shlomo Zalman Orbach permits it, because it involves
            no effort.
        </p>

            The Aruch HaShulchan (417:10) writes that a woman is allowed to work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> in order to make a living, and that such is the
            prevalent custom. The author of <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> (1:5) agrees. This can be derived from a <em>kal va’chomer</em> (<em>a fortiori</em>): If
            she is liable to lose her job, or if she needs that day’s wages desperately, she is permitted to work even on <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>, all the more
            so on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. If she can easily forgo working that day, then the meticulous ones act stringently. It seems to me that even
meticulous women act leniently when it comes to writing for purposes other than work-related [even though this is generally prohibited on            <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em>].
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to the Shibolei HaLeket, when <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is two days long, the custom for women not to work applies only on the second day,
            which is the first of the new month. The Roke’ach holds that it applies both days. The author of <em>Mor U’Ketziah</em> maintains that the custom
takes effect only during the day of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, not at night. It seems to me that women keep this custom at night, as well. See            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (417:4), <em>Biur Halachah</em> (end of 417), and <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> (11:8-9).

The Bi’ur Halachah (417, s.v. <em>minhag tov</em>) writes in the name of the Bach that a husband may not demand that his wife work on            <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, but she is permitted to do work if she pleases. As stated above, most <em>poskim</em> agree that a woman should, in any
            event, refrain from some form of work. Clearly, since a woman has a <em>mitzvah</em> to refrain from work, even though it is not obligatory, her
            husband cannot demand that she do work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, except housework, like cooking.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Chida, in <em>Yosef Ometz</em> (20), cites <em>Rishonim</em> who hold that men, as well, had a custom not to work on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, and
            he explains that this custom developed because they used to bow before God in the Holy Temple. The Turei Even (on Tractate <em>Megillah</em>)
claims that the custom was based on the <em>musaf</em> sacrifices that were offered in the Temple on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. Either way, most            <em>poskim</em> believe that this custom has no binding force, as the Mishnah Berurah writes in 417:2.

            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            417:1; <em>Iggrot Moshe, Orach Chayim</em> 1:142; <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 1:1-9. In notes 4-8 [of the last source], the author quotes the
Yera’im, the Shibolei HaLeket and the Or Zaru’a who say that the reason for <em>Birkat HaChodesh</em> is in order to let people know when            <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is going to be. The Ra’avyah writes that it is in commemoration of the <em>Kiddush HaChodesh</em> ceremony. For this reason,
some communities give the rabbi the honor of blessing the new moon (<em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 1:7). What I wrote concerning Tishrei is found in            <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 417:2. For alternative reasons, see <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 1:25. Some communities do not bless the month of Av,
            because of the calamities that occurred during that month, but the prevalent custom is to bless it. So explains Rav Kook, in <em>Olat Re’iyah</em>,
            vol. 2, p. 121, and <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 1:27.

This is why Ashkenazim refrain from saying memorial prayers for the dead on <em>Shabbat Mevarchim</em> (<em>Rama</em>, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 284:7,            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 284:17). They even omit the <em>Av HaRachamim</em> prayer, which is said in memory of those killed in sanctification of
            God’s name [during the Crusades]. The only exceptions are the two <em>S</em>abbaths prior to <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> Iyar and Sivan, because the holy
            martyrs were killed [mainly] during these two months. My teacher and rabbi, Rav Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook, used to recite <em>Av HaRachamim</em>
even on [an ordinary] <em>Shabbat Mevarchim</em>. He held that after the Holocaust it should be said on every Shabbat, just like it is said before            <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> Iyar and Sivan.

            If one is unsure whether or not he said <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in <em>Shacharit</em> or <em>Mincha</em>, he probably did not, and he must pray
            again. However, if he had in mind, in the middle of his prayers, to add <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>, but a doubt arose later on as to whether or not he
actually did so, he can assume that he said it, and he need not pray again (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 422:10). One who forgot to say<em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in the final <em>Mincha</em> service of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> should recite <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> twice in<em>Ma’ariv</em>, stipulating that if he is not obligated to pray twice his second prayer should be considered a voluntary one (            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 108:11; <em>Peninei Halachah</em> on Prayer, 18:10).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Customarily, the <em>gabbai</em> (sexton) calls out, “<em>Rosh Chodesh</em>” or “<em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>” prior to the Silent Prayer of            <em>Ma’ariv</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 236:2). In <em>Shacharit</em>, however, one may not interrupt between the blessing of <em>Geulah</em>
            (Redemption) and the Silent Prayer. Therefore, the custom is to bang on the podium twice, and the congregants understand this to be a reminder to
            insert <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>. In addition, some have a custom to raise their voices a bit when they reach the words <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> in
            their private prayers [to remind others to say it] (<em>Shiyurei Knesset HaGedolah</em>). See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 4:2. Another suggestion
is for the leader to end the blessing of <em>Ga’al Yisrael</em> in a <em>Rosh-Chodesh</em> tune, in order to remind the people to say            <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>.

            If one realizes that he forgot <em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em> before beginning the blessing of <em>HaTov VeHaMeitiv</em>, our Sages <em>z”l</em> decreed
that he should say, “Blessed [are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe] Who gave New Moons to His people Israel as a remembrance” (            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 188:7). According to the Bi’ur Halachah, one should say God’s name and mention His kingship when reciting this blessing,
            just as one does on <em>Shabbat</em> and <em>Yom Tov</em>. The Kaf HaChayim (31), however, maintains that God’s name and kingship are omitted.

If one did not eat a <em>kezayit</em> of bread after the stars emerged, the Shulchan Aruch rules that he must, nonetheless, say<em>Ya’aleh VeYavo</em>, as is the law on <em>Shabbat</em>, as explained there. According to the Rama, however, he should not say it. The            <em>Acharonim</em> also dispute the case of one who began <em>Se’udah Shlishit</em> on <em>Shabbat</em> and finished his meal on Saturday night,
            which is the beginning of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. See <em>Peninei Halachah, Shabbat</em>, 6:3, note 5, p. 99.

The issue of <em>Hallel</em> on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> is elucidated in <em>Arachin</em> 10b, <em>Ta’anit</em> 28b, <em>Tosafot</em> ibid., and            <em>Tosafot</em> <em>Berachot</em> 14a. See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em>, chap. 6, sections 1-6 and 20, with notes. Notes 2 and 27 there explain the
            reason for the custom. (There is another type of obligatory <em>Hallel</em>, which is not dependent on the sanctity of a day, rather on a
            salvation, like the one said on Chanukah. See below 4:6 and 11:8.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Practically speaking, most <em>Rishonim</em> hold that one should say a blessing on this <em>Hallel</em>; they are: Behag, Ritz Giat, Ra’avad,
            Rabbeinu Tam, Rosh, and Ran. Rav Hai Gaon, Rabbeinu Chananel, and Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah maintain that one recites a blessing when saying it in
public, but not in private. See <em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 422:2. Indeed, as the Shulchan Aruch writes, the Jews living around            <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> were accustomed to saying it without a blessing, but the Jews of Spain recited the blessing (<em>Ran, Maggid Mishnah</em>).
            The Rama (422:2) writes that the custom is to say a blessing, even when reciting <em>Hallel</em> alone, but that it is preferable to say it with a
            quorum, in order to satisfy those [authorities] who hold that one says the blessing only in public.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Until recently, several Sefardic communities, like Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey, followed the custom in which the cantor says the blessings –
            before and after <em>Hallel</em> – aloud, and the congregation answers, “Amen,” thus discharging their obligation; while those who pray privately
            omit the blessings. In his <em>Tevu’ot Shemesh</em> (<em>Orach Chayim</em> 68), Rabbi Mashash determined this to be the practical <em>halachah</em>
, and he himself would recite the blessing in an undertone, along with the cantor. This is also the opinion of R. Moshe Kalfon HaKohen,<em>av beit din</em> of Djerba, in <em>Brit Kehunah</em> (<em>Orach Chayim</em> 200:5) and <em>Sho’el VeNish’al</em> (2:60); R. Chayim Palagi in<em>Kaf HaChayim</em> (end of 33); and the authors of<em> Shalmei Chagigah</em> (p. 224), <em>Chesed LeAlafim</em> (422:2),            <em>Sha’ar HaMefa’ked</em>, and <em>Responsa Mikveh HaMayim</em> (3:24). Every community should continue following its own custom.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            When people from various ethnic groups pray together, even if the cantor’s custom is to skip the blessing, it is proper for one of the
            participants, who usually says a blessing, to say the blessing out loud and have in mind to absolve those who do not say a blessing of their
            obligation. This way, the congregants will satisfy the opinion of the many <em>poskim</em> who hold that one is required to say a blessing, and at
            the same time avoid the concern of making a blessing in vain. (See <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> 4:31, where the author is apprehensive about answering
            “Amen” to this blessing, for it may be in vain. However, many authorities hold that one need not worry about answering “Amen” to someone who makes
            a blessing in accordance with his ancestors’ custom, which is based on the viewpoint of prominent <em>poskim</em>. I also heard this from Rav
            Mordechai Eliyahu.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to all opinions, one should try to say <em>Hallel</em> with a congregation. Hence, it is better to say it with a <em>minyan</em> before
prayers than to say it alone afterwards. This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Peretz, as cited in the <em>Beit Yosef</em> (422:2). Many            <em>Acharonim</em> quote this as well, as we stated above, and as the author of <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> writes (chap. 23, n. 44). According to
            the Kaf HaChayim (422:38), one should not change the order of the prayers.

            Rav Amram Gaon mentions both customs in his <em>siddur</em>, the first one as the Sefardic custom and the second as the Ashkenazi practice. Tosafot
            and the Ran (<em>Sukkah</em> 38b) also cite the Ashkenazi custom [as described above], as do the Tur and Beit Yosef 422:3. The congregation
            fulfills their obligation to say [the other three verses] by hearing the cantor chant them out loud. Therefore, they can simply answer הודו לה' כי
            טוב כי לעולם חסדו. Many <em>Acharonim</em> write that since there is reason for concern that some congregants may not hear the cantor properly, it
            is best for the congregation to say the verses along with the cantor, finish shortly before him, and then answer הודו לה' כי טוב כי לעולם חסדו.
            This is the opinion of Magen Avraham 422:8, Eliyah Rabbah 13, Machatzit HaShekel and Mishnah Berurah 20. See also <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 6:15.

            According to <strong>Sefardic tradition</strong>, the cantor, followed by the congregation, says the first part twice and then the second part
            twice. <strong>The Ashkenazi custom</strong> is that the cantor and the congregation say each part once at a time responsively. This raises a
            question. The Talmud states in <em>Megillah</em> 22a that one is forbidden to interrupt a verse in the middle, except for the purpose of teaching
            young children. Tosafot (<em>Sukkah</em> 38b) answer that two people composed this verse – David and his brother. The Kolbo suggests that one is
            forbidden to split a verse in two only if it is from the Torah (<em>Magen Avraham</em> 422:8). The Maharsham explains in <em>Da’at Torah</em> that
            one is permitted to divide a verse if it is being used for prayer. See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 6:18, n. 37.

        <p dir="LTR">
            Ashkenazim say the four verses beginning with the words אודך, אבן מאסו, מאת ה', זה היום twice. The custom of many Jews from North Africa is that
            the cantor says each verse once, after which the congregation responds likewise, and since “hearing is like answering,” it is considered as if they
            said each verse twice.

            The Beit Yosef (25:13) gives a different reason: it is inappropriate to be without the crown of <em>tefillin</em> when saying the stanza beginning
            with <em>Keter</em> (“crown”) in the <em>kedushah</em> of <em>Musaf</em>. However, even Ashkenazim, who omit <em>Keter</em>, are accustomed to
            removing their <em>tefillin</em> before <em>Musaf</em>. Therefore, I cited the Levush’s explanation that <em>Musaf</em> is considered a “sign,”
similar to <em>Yom Tov</em>, on which we do not wear <em>tefillin</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</em> 31:1). See<em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 8:1. The prevalent custom is to remove the <em>tefillin</em> after <em>kaddish</em> (according to the Ba’al HaTanya’s            <em>siddur</em>, they are removed before <em>kaddish</em>). See <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 8:4-6.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            This raises a question regarding the common practice to don <em>tefillin</em> at the circumcision of one’s son, in order to be surrounded by two
            signs. Do we not learn from the law of [<em>tefillin</em> on] <em>Shabbat</em> and <em>Yom Tov</em> that one should not display two signs together,
            for each one implies that the other is insufficient, thus degrading it (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 31:1)? The Eliyah Rabbah (29) answers in the name
            of the Roke’ach that the sign of circumcision is not in commemoration of the Exodus from Egypt; therefore, it is good to combine it with another
            sign. <em>Tefillin</em>, <em>Shabbat</em>, and <em>Yom Tov</em>, however, are in commemoration of the Exodus and should not be joined together.

For the order of the Torah reading, see <em>Tur, Beit Yosef, Shulchan Aruch</em>, and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 423:2; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 423:4;<em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 7:9. If one said <em>Musaf</em> before <em>Shacharit</em>, he has discharged his obligation, but ideally one must pray            <em>Shacharit</em> first, just as one must sacrifice the daily burnt offering before all other offerings (Rama 286:1).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            For more on <em>Borchi Nafshi</em>, see <em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 7:5. The following authorities hold that <em>Borchi Nafshi</em> was the daily
            song for <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> [in the Temple]: The Vilna Gaon (<em>Ma’aseh Rav</em> 157), B’nei Yissachar (<em>Rosh Chodesh</em> 3:1), and Aruch
            HaShulchan (423:5, 424:3). Ashkenazim and Chassidim (Nusach Sefard) say <em>Borchi Nafshi</em> after the regular daily song; the Chassidim recite
            both songs after <em>Hallel</em> and the Ashkenazim, after <em>Musaf</em> (<em>Sefer Rosh Chodesh</em> 7, n. 5). Some Sefardim have the custom of
saying the daily song after <em>U’Va LeTzion</em>, before the <em>kadish</em> that precedes <em>Musaf</em>, and <em>Borchi Nafshi</em> after            <em>Musaf</em>. Others say <em>Borchi Nafshi</em> after <em>Musaf</em> and omit the daily song altogether.

            The Ashkenazim customarily return the Torah scroll to the Ark immediately after it is read (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 423:5). The Shulchan Aruch
(423:3) writes that it should be returned after <em>U’Va LeTzion</em>, and Sefardim and Chassidim follow this practice. (However, the author of            <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> [135:2 and 423:11] agrees with the Ashkenazi custom, and Rav Ovadyah Yosef follows it for Kabbalistic reasons, returning the
            Torah scroll, on Rosh Chodesh and Mondays and Thursdays, immediately after the reading [<em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 423:6 with notes].)

            Numerous <em>Midrashim</em> indicate that the Gentiles follow the solar calendar, as do the Christians. We can explain this as follows: The desire
            to utilize the sun stems from a desire for absolute perfection. However, that is beyond man’s reach. And since the Gentiles fail to attain absolute
            perfection, they forfeit what they could have achieved by revealing God’s name in the world. The Jews, on the other hand, know how to operate
            within this world while clinging to God, which manifests itself through constant self-perfection. Calculating the months according to the moon’s
            cycle alludes to our efforts in this world, while calculating the years according to the sun’s orbit hints to our constant aspiration for
            perfection. The Muslims learned from the Jews to count by the moon, but only by the moon. This signifies a lack of aspiration for continuous
            self-perfection and an entrenchment in this world. It also explains why they perceive reward, even in the hereafter, in physical terms.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            It is important to add that even when the moon is invisible to us, it remains whole in its “hiding-place.” It’s just that all the light it absorbs
            from the sun is reflected back towards the sun and is thus indiscernible on earth. The same is true of the Jewish nation: even when it descends,
            its inner essence remains unblemished; "<em>You are entirely beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you"</em> (<em>Shir HaShirim</em> 4:7).

            Reciting this blessing is like greeting the <em>Shechinah</em> because the <em>Shechinah</em> alludes to <em>Kenesset Yisrael</em> (the Assembly of

            The Ridbaz (1:341) writes that it primarily depends on the ability to derive benefit from its light, and many <em>Acharonim</em> cite his words,
            including the Magen Avaraham and Mishnah Berurah 426:3. However, the Chida writes in <em>Moreh BeEtzba</em> (184) that one may not recite the
            blessing even if the moon is covered only by a very thin cloud, and the Ben Ish Chai (<em>Shanah Bet, VaYikra</em> 23) concurs. Nevertheless,
            according to the letter of the law, it seems that all agree that one may recite the blessing as long as one benefits from the light. This is the
            conclusion of the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 426:5.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Eshel Avraham of Buchach explains that one may recite the blessing if the light of the moon allows one to see most of the things that are
            usually visible when the moon is unobstructed. This is assessed based on the moon’s light on the seventh night of the month, or the fourth of the
            month, if there is a pressing need. In his opinion, one may recite the blessing towards the middle of the month even if the moon is covered by a
            thicker cloud, and one may recite it towards the beginning of the month only if the cloud is very thin. The <em>poskim</em>, however, seem to
indicate that the distinction depends on the thickness of the cloud, not the day on which the blessing is recited. So writes the author of            <em>Sefer Kiddush Levanah</em> 2:3 (with notes). Therefore, in my humble opinion, it seems that if one can see the outline of the moon, it is
            considered “visible” (possibly even according to those who are meticulous), and the blessing may be said.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to the letter of the law, though, the <em>halachah</em> follows the opinion of the Ridbaz and the Eshel Avraham. This is apparent from
            the words of the Terumat HaDeshen quoted in <em>Leket Yosher</em>: “Once, he saw only a small portion of the moon, because it was partially covered
            by a cloud, and he nevertheless sanctified [it].”
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some say that one should look at the moon only briefly. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:13 and <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 34.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Many authorities write that one who recited the blessing without looking at the moon has fulfilled his obligation, as long as he could have seen it
[had he looked] (see <em>Sefer Kiddush Levanah</em> 2:11). They derive this, by logical inference from [the law of] a blind man. Most            <em>poskim</em> hold that a blind man must say <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>, because the blessing was instituted in recognition of the renewal of the
            moon. In addition, even the blind benefit from the moon; after all, others use its light to escort them. This is the viewpoint of the Rashal, Magen
            Avraham, Eliyah Rabbah, and Pri Chadash. However, the Maharikash holds that a blind man should not recite the blessing, for he does not derive
            pleasure from the moon. In practice, a blind man should not recite the blessing, because of the uncertainty surrounding the matter. Nevertheless,
            it is preferable for him to hear the blessing from someone else (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:1; <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em>, s.v. <em>nehenin</em>
            ; <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 2).

            See <em>Sefer Kiddush Levanah</em> (chap. 2, n. 9) where the author quotes <em>Rav Pe’alim</em> (vol. 3, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 68) who is unsure
            how to rule in a case where the moon will disappear in the middle of the blessing, but no days remain on which to recite <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>.
            He concludes, “It is possible to say that under such dire circumstances everyone agrees that one should say the blessing, but further investigation
            is required.” The author of <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> (<em>Tefillah</em> 15:12) writes that if one is concerned that immediately after beginning the
            blessing the moon will be covered, it is permissible to say the blessing, <em>be’di’avad</em> (ex post facto).

See <em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 426:4, <em>Bach</em> and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> ibid., <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 61,            <em>Sefer Kiddush Levanah</em> 3:1-2. Many <em>Rishonim</em> hold that the blessing should be said immediately upon the moon’s reappearance [at the
            beginning of the month]. R. Ya’akov Roke’ach writes in <em>Shulchan Lechem HaPanim</em> that this seems to be the opinion of R. Amram Gaon, Behag,
            Rif, Rambam, Rosh, and others. The Bach points out that the Talmud implies that one should not say <em>Kiddush Levanah</em> after the seventh day.
The Rambam, as well, indicates that it is preferable to say it as early as possible. On the other hand, some [<em>poskim</em>] infer from Tractate            <em>Soferim</em> (20:1) that one should not bless the new moon until it is possible to benefit from its light. Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah, R. David
            Avudraham, the Kolbo, and others espouse this viewpoint. This is also the practical implication of the discussion cited above in note 23. According
            to Kabbalah, one should say the blessing after seven days. In practice, the custom of Ashkenazim is to bless the moon after three days have passed.
            This is also the custom of the Jews of Morocco and other North African communities (so writes Rabbi Mashash and many others). The majority of
            Sefardim, based on Kabbalah, as well as the Chassidim, are accustomed to reciting the blessing after seven days. Moreover, some Ashkenazim follow
            this custom <em>le’chatchillah</em> (preferentially), as the Chatam Sofer (<em>Orach Chayim</em> 102) and Aruch HaShulchan (426:13) write.
            Nonetheless, when the seventh falls out on a Saturday night, it seems preferable to recite <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> then, even if seven complete
            days from the <em>molad</em> have not yet passed. After all… the moon’s light is already abundant and part of a day is regarded as an entire day.
All the more so seeing that it is Saturday night, a joyous time which is suited for <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>. Besides which, several            <em>poskim</em> hold that one should recite the blessing as early as possible (Ramban and his adherents), while others assert that one should not
            say it later than the seventh of the month (Bach). Therefore, it is proper to say it on the night of the seventh, even if seven complete days have
            not passed since the <em>molad</em>. This is how the Kenesset HaGedolah, Rama of Panow (78), Nahar Mitzrayim, Eliyah Rabbah, Eshel Avraham of
            Buchach, Maharsham, and others conclude (see <em>Sefer Kiddush Levanah</em> 3:8, with notes 27 and 29; <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> 2:24).

            <strong>Women and Birkat HaLevanah</strong>
            : Since this blessing is time-dependant, women are exempt from reciting it. And even though Ashkenazi custom allows women to say blessings that
depend on time, the prevalent custom is for woman not to recite this one (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 426:1). See            <em>Peninei Halachah, Tefillat Nashim</em>, chap. 23, sec. 1:1.
