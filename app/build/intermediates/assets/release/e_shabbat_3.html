        1. Shabbat times
    </h2>
    <p>
        In the Torah, night precedes day for all matters. This is derived from
        the description of the world’s creation, about which the Torah states:
        "And there was evening and there was morning, day one" (Bereishit 1:5).
        This tells us that each 24-hour day begins at night, and thus Shabbat,
        the seventh day, begins at night. An important concept is enfolded
        within this Jewish outlook - night and darkness precede day and light.
        First questions and dilemmas arise and one is mired in darkness and
        uncertainty, but from this answers emerge and light shines upon him.
        This is also true of our history. At first we were enslaved to Pharaoh
        in Egypt, but from there were freed, received the Torah, and entered
        Eretz Yisrael. This is how it always is for the Jewish people -
        darkness and troubles are followed by light and redemption. First we
        must deal with our problems, but from within them we are elevated and
        refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, when it comes to the nations of the world, day precedes
        night. Nation after nation ascends the stage of history, makes a vast
        noise, and shakes up the world. But when difficulties arise and
        problems begin, the night draws nearer, and finally the nation declines
        and disappears. It happened to the Babylonians, the Persians, the
        Greeks, and the Romans. The secret of Jewish immortality is connected
        to the fact that for us, the night precedes the day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the night precedes the day, the seventh day begins at the
        beginning of the night. But the Sages were uncertain as to exactly when
        night begins. Is it when the sun sets and is no longer visible to us,
        or is it when it becomes dark and three medium-sized stars can be seen
        in the sky? In other words, are day and night defined by sun or by
        light? In Eretz Yisrael, about twenty minutes separate sunset and the
        emergence of the stars, though this interval fluctuates based on the
        time of year and the particular locale’s elevation above sea level, as
        explained in n. 1 below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another unique feature of Judaism is that not every question has an
        absolute answer. Doubt and uncertainty occasionally play a role, and
        the present <em>halakha</em> is an example of this. The time between
        sunset (<em>shki’at ha-ĥama</em>, or "<em>shki’a</em>") and the
emergence of stars (<em>tzeit</em> <em>ha-kokhavim</em>, or "        <em>tzeit</em>") is classified as a time when it is uncertain whether
        it is day or night and is called "<em>bein ha-shmashot</em>."
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, for all Torah laws, including Shabbat, we follow the
        well-known principle: "<em>Safek de-Oraita le-ĥumra</em>," that is, we
        rule strictly when in doubt about Torah law.<em> </em>Therefore,
        Shabbat begins at <em>shki’a</em> and ends at <em>tzeit</em>.

        2. The Mitzva of <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The inherent sanctity of Shabbat is present only from the beginning of
        the seventh day, when Shabbat starts. However, the Torah commands that
        we extend the sanctity of Shabbat into the mundane week. That is, we
        are meant to accept the holiness of Shabbat upon ourselves a bit before
        the start of the seventh day. The same applies to the end of Shabbat:
        it ends at the end of the seventh day, but we are commanded to extend
this holiness a little longer after Shabbat (SA 261:2;        <em>Bi’ur Halakha</em> states that most authorities consider this
        extension to be a Torah law).
    </p>
    <p>
        This extension of Shabbat, called <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>,
        demonstrates that Shabbat is very dear to us. We go out to greet it
        before its arrival, and we prolong its stay by accompanying it upon
        departure. It is like an honored guest whom we go out to greet and whom
        we escort when it is time to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
We have already learned that the status of the time between        <em>shki’a</em> and <em>tzeit</em> is uncertain, and thus one must be
stringent then. Therefore, in order to fulfill the mitzva of<em>tosefet Shabbat</em> we need to accept Shabbat a bit before        <em>shki’a</em>. Women customarily accept Shabbat when they light the
        Shabbat candles. In Jerusalem the custom is to light candles forty
        minutes before <em>shki’a</em>, in Haifa thirty minutes before, and in
        Tel Aviv and most other Israeli cities twenty minutes before. Men who
        recite the <em>Minĥa</em> prayers close to <em>shki’a </em>are
        accustomed to accept Shabbat later, but they too must be careful to
        accept Shabbat a few minutes before <em>shki’a</em> in order to add to
        the holy from the mundane.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who wishes to accept Shabbat even earlier is commendable, as long
        as it is within a seasonal hour and a quarter before <em>shki’a</em>.
        According to many <em>poskim</em>, one may not accept Shabbat earlier
        than this (SA 263:4; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 18).

    </p>
    <p>
        Shabbat concludes with the appearance of three medium-sized stars, but
        the Sages were worried that people might make a mistake and think that
        three large stars were medium-sized. Therefore, to be on the safe side,
        they said that one should wait until the appearance of three small
        stars grouped together (SA 293:2). Nowadays we do not need to look at
        the stars. Rather we can rely on clocks and calendars, where the times
listed for the end of Shabbat already incorporate        <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        This mitzva teaches us that there is a connection between the weekdays
        and Shabbat, which is why we can add from the mundane to the sacred. We
        can also see, based on this, the inner striving of the mundane to be
        connected to the sacred.

        3. How to Accept <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        One can accept <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> verbally by saying "I hereby
        accept upon myself the sanctity of Shabbat." Some maintain that one can
        even accept <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> mentally (MB 261:21). Once one has
        accepted Shabbat, he must be careful not to do any <em>melakha</em> (as
        will be explained in the next section).
    </p>
    <p>
As mentioned, women customarily accept Shabbat when reciting the        <em>berakha</em> over lighting Shabbat candles. Since they invoke
        Shabbat, they intend to accept it upon themselves, thus fulfilling the
        mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>. According to most authorities, a
        woman may light candles conditionally, having in mind that she is not
accepting Shabbat with the lighting. In such a case she may do        <em>melakha</em> or drive to shul after lighting. Nevertheless, it is
        preferable that she accept Shabbat when she lights, since some maintain
        that one may not light conditionally, in which case once she lights
Shabbat candles she has accepted Shabbat and may not do        <em>melakha</em>. Furthermore, if she does not accept Shabbat when she
lights candles, there is concern that she will forget<em>tosefet Shabbat </em>altogether (SA 263:10; SSK 43:24;        <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 263:44).
    </p>
    <p>
        At one time, men customarily accepted Shabbat during prayer with the
        recitation of "<em>Bo’i kalla, Shabbat ha-malka</em>"<em> </em>("Enter
        O bride, O Shabbat queen") in the liturgical poem <em>Lekha Dodi</em>.
        However, nowadays in many shuls they do not finish <em>Lekha Dodi</em>
before <em>shki’a</em>. Accordingly, in order to fulfill the mitzva of<em>tosefet Shabbat</em>, the <em>gabbai</em> should announce after        <em>Minĥa</em>: "<em>Bo’i kalla, Shabbat ha-malka</em>," at which point
        everyone should accept Shabbat. If the <em>gabbai</em> does not make
this announcement, then each individual should say to himself "<em>Bo’i kalla, Shabbat ha-malka</em>" or "        <em>Hineni mekabel al atzmi kedushat Shabbat</em>"<em> </em>("I hereby
        accept upon myself the sanctity of Shabbat"). Additionally, if one is
afraid that the <em>ĥazan</em> will not complete the repetition of the        <em>Minĥa</em> <em>Amida</em> before <em>shki’a</em>, he may whisper
        the declaration to himself during the repetition, to ensure that he not
        lose the opportunity to fulfill the mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>.

    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Laws Pertaining to One Who Accepts Shabbat upon Himself
    </h2>
    <p>
        From the time one accepts <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>, he must refrain
        from all <em>melakhot</em> forbidden by Torah law. Rabbinically
prohibited actions are also forbidden at this point, unless the        <em>melakha</em> to be done is for a mitzva, for a Shabbat need, or for
        some other great need, because in such situations the Sages did not
        intend for their prohibitions to apply. For example, if one forgot to
        tithe produce and wishes to eat it on Shabbat, he may tithe it even if
        he has already accepted Shabbat, because tithing produce on Shabbat is
        only prohibited rabbinically.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who has already accepted <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> may ask a fellow
        Jew who has yet to accept Shabbat to do <em>melakha</em> on his behalf.
        Women generally light candles and accept Shabbat at the time listed on
calendars. Men, in contrast, go to shul to pray the weekday        <em>Minĥa</em> (which usually begins shortly after candle lighting),
        and only then accept Shabbat. In the intervening period, a woman may
        ask her husband to do <em>melakhot</em> such as turning on a light or
        adjusting the oven, even though she has already accepted Shabbat (SA
        263:17; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 64). Similarly, on Saturday night one who
has not yet made <em>havdala</em> may ask one who has to do        <em>melakha</em> for him.

    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. May One Pray <em>Minĥa</em> after Accepting Shabbat?
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are shuls where the weekday <em>Minĥa</em> on Friday is finished
        after <em>shki’a</em>, so that if the participants wait to accept
        Shabbat until after <em>Minĥa</em>, Shabbat in fact has already begun,
        and they are unable to fulfill the mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>.
        Thus the question arises: may one accept Shabbat but then pray the
        weekday <em>Minĥa</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
        According to some authorities, one who has accepted Shabbat may no
        longer pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>, because one may not pray a
        weekday <em>Minĥa</em> after Shabbat has begun (and one may not pray
        Shabbat <em>Minĥa</em>, because that is to be said only on Saturday).
        Therefore, in their opinion, one who mistakenly accepted Shabbat before
        praying <em>Minĥa</em> has lost the opportunity to pray <em>Minĥa</em>,
        and during <em>Ma’ariv</em> he should pray the <em>Amida</em> twice.
        The first time serves as the regular <em>Ma’ariv</em> of Shabbat and
        the second time is to compensate for the <em>Minĥa</em> that he missed
        (SA 263:15; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 60). This applies to women as well, and
        thus a woman may not pray <em>Minĥa</em> after she has lit candles -
        how can she pray a weekday <em>Minĥa</em> after she has accepted
        Shabbat? If she wishes to compensate for missing <em>Minĥa</em>, she
should pray the <em>Amida</em> twice at <em>Ma’ariv</em> (MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 43). The only alternative is to pray <em>Minĥa</em>
earlier, while it is still day, and to accept Shabbat afterward. Where<em>Minĥa</em> is prayed after <em>shki’a</em>, one must pray<em>Minĥa</em> earlier on his own so that he will be able to add        <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>. For the mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> is
        a Torah law, while praying with a <em>minyan</em> is a rabbinic
        requirement (SSK 46:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        Several authorities maintain, however, that even after one has accepted
Shabbat, he may still pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. They reason that        <em>tosefet Shabbat </em>only requires that one not transgress any
        Torah prohibitions of Shabbat, but does not extend to the realm of
        prayer; thus, one may still pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. Just as in
        the service of a mitzva one may do things that are rabbinically
        prohibited during <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>, so too he may pray the
        weekday <em>Minĥa</em> then. Only one who accepted Shabbat with the
        congregation may not pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. Therefore, if one
has still not prayed <em>Minĥa</em> and it is very close to        <em>shki’a</em>, he should accept Shabbat verbally and then pray the
weekday <em>Minĥa</em> (<em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>13:42;        <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak </em>9:20). Still others maintain that in such a
        case one must be careful to accept Shabbat only mentally. On the one
        hand, one may accept Shabbat this way; on the other hand, since it was
only in his head, he may still pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em> (        <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 7:34).
    </p>
    <p>
        The widespread custom is that if <em>shki’a</em> is approaching and one
has still not prayed <em>Minĥa</em>, he accepts        <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> - whether verbally or mentally - and then
        prays the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, women too may
pray <em>Minĥa</em> after lighting candles. If one knows that the        <em>minyan</em> is going to pray <em>Minĥa</em> late, he should
        preferably fulfill his obligation in conformity with all opinions by
praying <em>Minĥa</em> on his own and accepting Shabbat before        <em>shki’a</em>. If he is sure that he will be able to accept Shabbat
        during the repetition of the <em>Amida</em>, it is best that he pray
        with the <em>minyan</em> and accept <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> during the
        repetition.

The topic of <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> is discussed in            <em>Shabbat</em> 34b-35b. There it emerges that in R. Yehuda’s
            opinion, <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> extends from <em>shki’a </em>
            until the reddish tint disappears from the west and is replaced by
a silvery hue; R. Yossi disagrees and maintains that            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> is very short, like the blink of an eye,
            occurring after the end of R. Yehuda’s <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>.
            In terms of practice, R. Yoĥanan maintains that we follow the
stringencies of both (<em>ibid</em>. 35a), which means that            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> begins with <em>shki’a</em> and concludes
            after the time suggested by R. Yossi. The Sages provide us with an
            indicator for the end of <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> according to R.
            Yossi: the emergence of three stars. This perforce means three
            medium-sized stars, as large stars can be seen even during the day
            and small ones are visible only at night (<em>ibid</em>. 35b). The
            Talmud goes on to explain that according to Rabba (whom the Rif and
Rosh follow in their ruling), <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> begins at            <em>shki’a</em> and lasts for the time it takes to walk three
            quarters of a mil (roughly equivalent to a kilometer). Rashi, the
Vilna Gaon, and many others say that the time of            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> according to R. Yossi is immediately
            after the time of R. Yehuda, so no more time needs to be added. In
            contrast, Ramban and Rosh maintain that it is a bit later and one
            must add half a minute. Others say that it is even later and one
            must add a few minutes (Raavan). See <em>Ha-zemanim Ba-halakha</em>
            40:8-16.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Shki’a</em>
refers to the time when the sun disappears from sight entirely (            <em>Responsa Maharam al-Ashkar</em> §96). It would seem that nearby
            hills that hide the sun are not taken into consideration; rather
            the horizon is determinant. However, it is possible one should take
into account distant mountains that span the entire horizon. See<em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Prayer</em> ch. 11 n. 7 regarding<em>hanetz</em> <em>ha-ĥama </em>(sunrise). In terms of            <em>tzeit</em>, several uncertainties arise, for different times
            have been suggested for the appearance of three middle-sized stars.
            The uncertainty is rooted in the question of who must be able to
            see these three stars. Is it those with perfect or impeccable
            vision who know about star charts and know where the first stars
            appear in each season, or is it determined by the average person on
            the street? It would seem that people with impeccable sight can see
            three stars once the sun sinks more than 4.8 degrees below the
            horizon. Regular people can see three stars when the sun is 6.2
            degrees below the horizon. One should also know that there are
three factors that impact the interval between <em>shki’a </em>and            <em>tzeit</em>: 1) The season; in the spring and fall, the sun sets
            along a line that is perpendicular to the horizon, and therefore
            the interval is shorter, while in the winter and summer it sets on
            a line that intersects the horizon diagonally, so the interval is
            longer. 2) Elevation; the higher the elevation of a place, the
longer the sun is visible (and thus the later <em>shki’a </em>is).            <em>Tzeit</em>, however, will be at the same time regardless of
elevation. Therefore, in higher places, the time separating            <em>shki’a</em> and <em>tzeit</em> is shorter. 3) Latitude; the
            closer one is to the equator, the shorter <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>
            is. As one approaches the poles, it lengthens. There are places
            where it can last for hours and even days.
        </p>
        <p>
In practice, in Eretz Yisrael at sea level the time of            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> based on those with good vision (4.8
            degrees) in the middle of spring and fall is about 19 minutes, and
            at the height of the summer it is about 21 minutes. Based on people
with regular vision (6.2 degrees), in the middle of spring and fall            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> is 25 minutes, and at the height of the
            summer it is nearly 30 minutes. In Jerusalem, whose highest hills
            are about 830m above sea level, <em>shki’a</em> is about five
            minutes later, so<em> bein ha-shmashot</em> is about five minutes
            shorter. Thus, in Jerusalem, <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> based on
            those with good vision in the middle of the spring and fall is
            about 14 minutes, and at the height of summer it is 16:22 minutes.
Basing it on people with normal vision, in spring and fall            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> is about twenty and a half minutes, and
            at the height of summer is about 24 minutes. (One who explores this
            issue will come to understand how these calculations work out with
            the traditional time for <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> as equal to the
            time it takes to walk three quarters of a mil. All this is
explained at length in <em>Harĥavot</em> and briefly in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> ch. 25 n. 3 in the context of the
            time for the nighttime recitation of <em>Shema.</em>)
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything written here so far follows the approach of the Ge’onim.
            However, Rabbeinu Tam has a different approach. He maintains that
            after <em>shki’a</em>, the day continues for the time it takes to
walk 3.25 mil, or approximately 58.5 minutes.            <em>Bein ha-shmashot</em> begins only after that, and lasts for the
            length of time it takes to walk three quarters of a mil, or
            approximately 13.5 minutes. This is followed by night. Although
            many follow this approach, including SA 261:2, it is still very
            puzzling, because in fact we see three medium-sized stars much
earlier than R. Tam’s reckoning of <em>tzeit</em> (see BHL            <em>ad loc</em>.). In fact, in Eretz Yisrael and its environs, the
            custom has always followed the Ge’onim. Some explain that Rabbeinu
            Tam’s approach was based on his location. He lived in France, which
            is further north, and there <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> lasts longer.
            In any event, common practice is not to take R. Tam’s opinion into
            account (<em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>17:62; <em>Shemesh U-magen </em>
            1:5; <em>Ha-zemanim Ba-halakha</em> chs. 43-45, 48, 50). Some write
            that ideally one should be stringent like Rabbeinu Tam and assume
that Shabbat ends 72 minutes after <em>shki’a</em> (            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 2:21). See <em>Harĥavot</em>.

Many maintain that one may accept Shabbat only from            <em>plag ha-minĥa</em>, which is one and a quarter seasonal hours
before the end of the day. One may then light the candles with a            <em>berakha</em>, pray the Shabbat prayers (following the opinion
            of R. Yehuda), and make <em>kiddush</em> (<em>Tosafot</em>, Rosh,
            and Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona to <em>Berakhot</em> 27a; SA 267:2; Rema
            261:2). Others maintain that one may accept Shabbat even earlier,
            as long as it is clear that the candles are being lit to honor
Shabbat (Rabbeinu Asher of Lunel; <em>Pri Ĥadash</em>;            <em>Pri Megadim</em>. R. Avraham b. Azriel maintains that one may
            accept it two hours early). However, <em>poskim</em> disagree
regarding what is considered the end of the day for            <em>plag ha-minĥa</em> purposes. <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em>
            calculates it from <em>tzeit</em>, while the Vilna Gaon calculates
            from <em>shki’a</em>. We follow the opinion that the calculation is
            done from <em>shki’a</em>. This is because, first, that is the
            dominant position, and second, there is an opinion that one may
accept Shabbat earlier than <em>plag ha-minĥa</em>. See<em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Prayer</em> ch. 24 n. 9 and            <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Zemanim</em> ch. 13 n. 14.

            As we saw in n. 1 above, the longest time between <em>shki’a </em>
            and <em>tzeit</em> in Eretz Yisrael is just under 30 minutes (at
            the height of the summer in low-lying areas). Calendars nowadays
generally record the end of Shabbat as 35 minutes after            <em>shki’a</em>, so that there is always <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>.

            In a locale where there is only one synagogue, the congregation’s
            acceptance of Shabbat obligates the entire community. However, in
            practice this does not come up often, because generally we do not
            accept Shabbat as a community very early, and if it is just a few
            minutes before <em>shki’a</em> everyone is obligated to accept
            Shabbat anyway to fulfill the mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>.
            Nevertheless, if the entire community accepted Shabbat, some say
            that this acceptance is more binding than an individual’s
            acceptance, and in such a case even for a mitzva or great necessity
            one would still be prohibited from transgressing anything, even
            rabbinic prohibitions (MB 261:18, 28). Others maintain that
            anything permitted after an individual accepts Shabbat (as we
            explain below in ch. 4 n. 5) is also permitted after the community
accepts Shabbat (quoted by BHL 261:4, s.v. "ein me’arvin"). See            <em>Harĥavot</em>, which explains that in a case of great necessity
            one may rely on the lenient opinion. In any case, even after the
community has accepted Shabbat, as well as during<em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, one may ask a non-Jew to do            <em>melakha</em> on behalf of a Jew for the sake of a mitzva or a
            great need (SA 342:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 7; MB 261:18, 28).

            To complete this discussion, we must add three laws. 1) The general
rule that one may transgress rabbinic prohibitions during            <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> for a mitzva or a great need does not
            apply to rabbinic prohibitions whose transgression is likely to
            lead one to a violation of Torah law. For example, one would not be
            allowed to do a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> or to
carry objects in the public domain by moving them less than four            <em>tefaĥim </em>at a time. This is explained in MB 342:1. 2)
            Although the general rule is that one who has accepted Shabbat may
            not transgress a rabbinic prohibition unless there is a mitzva
            involved or a great need, the rule does not apply to asking a
            non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> for him. This is permitted even if
            it is not for a mitzva or great need, as explained in MB 261:18. 3)
            Technically, if one has not accepted Shabbat, the rabbinic Shabbat
prohibitions do not take effect until the end of            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>. The body of the text does not mention
            this because it is almost irrelevant in practice. If one is part of
            a local Jewish community, he may assume that the majority of the
community will accept Shabbat before <em>shki’a</em>, and all            <em>melakhot</em> would then be prohibited for this person as well
            (except for asking a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em>, which is
            permitted during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, as explained above). If
            he lives in a locale where there are no Jews, there is still a
            mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat </em>before <em>shki’a</em>, and
            transgressing rabbinic laws will still be prohibited except for a
            mitzva, for Shabbat, or for a great need, when he may be lenient,
            as we have learned.

            A woman who has good reason to travel by car after lighting
            candles, such as to go to the Kotel, to shul, or to see her family,
            may get into a car if the driver has not accepted Shabbat yet.
            However, she must make sure not to open or shut the car door
            herself if this would make the light inside the car go on or off
            (see <em>Harĥavot</em>).

Following the first opinion, if one comes to shul close to<em>shki’a</em> and knows that if he begins to pray the weekday<em>Minĥa</em> he will not finish his silent <em>Amida</em> before            <em>shki’a</em>, he should preferably accept Shabbat and later pray
            the <em>Amida</em> of <em>Ma’ariv </em>twice. This is the opinion
            of MB 263:43, SSK, and R. Mazuz. A woman who does not have time to
            pray <em>Minĥa</em> and then light the candles should light the
            candles and not pray. If she prays <em>Minĥa</em> regularly, she
            may pray the <em>Amida</em> of <em>Ma’ariv </em>twice, with the
second recitation being compensatory. See            <em>Peninei Halakha: Women’s Prayer </em>13:6.
        </p>
        <p>
Following the second opinion, if one comes to shul close to            <em>shki’a</em>, he should accept <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> and pray
            the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. One may pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>
even after accepting <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>, as            <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> only causes <em>melakhot</em> to be
prohibited but does not affect prayer. This is the position of            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>, following <em>Zera Emet</em> and other
            Aĥaronim. <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 9:20 agrees and adds another
            reason: even on Shabbat itself one may pray the weekday prayer, but
            in order to shorten the service the Sages formulated an abbreviated
version. Therefore, when necessary, one may pray the weekday<em>Minĥa</em> even after accepting <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>.            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> §263 records this approach as that of many
            Aĥaronim.
        </p>
        <p>
Some follow the second opinion but maintain that one must accept            <em>tosefet</em> <em>Shabbat</em> only mentally but not verbally.
            In other words, he decides to refrain from <em>melakha</em> from
            here on, thus fulfilling the mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em>,
            but since he has not verbalized this acceptance he may still pray
the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. R. Ovadia Yosef writes this in            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 7:34, p. 97 and <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §6; see
            also <em>Menuĥat Ahava </em>1:5:6.
        </p>
        <p>
            An additional dispute among the Aĥaronim concerns the questionable
status of one who responds with the congregation to the<em>ĥazan</em>’s declaration of "<em>Barkhu</em>." According to            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 6:18, one may not respond to <em>Barkhu</em>
            and still maintain that he has not accepted Shabbat. Thus one who
            responded may no longer pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>. On the
            other hand, <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 3:37 maintains that if one
            thinks to himself that he is not accepting Shabbat, he may respond
            to <em>Barkhu</em> and still pray the weekday <em>Minĥa</em>
            afterward; however, based on SA 263:15, he should make sure to pray
            outside of shul.
