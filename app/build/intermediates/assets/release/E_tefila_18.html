    Chapter Eighteen: Errors, Additions, and Omissions in the <em>Amidah</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. Error, Omission, and Interruption in the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    A person who skips one of the eighteen <em>berachot</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> does not fulfill his obligation of the mitzvah of prayer. Even if he does
actually recite the full <em>Amidah</em>, but rearranges the order of the <em>berachot</em>, he does not fulfill his obligation. This is because    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>, who instituted the wording of prayer, meticulously established the order of the <em>berachot</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>
    and based their carefully selected words on verses of Scripture (<em>Megillah</em> 17b; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 119:3).
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, a person who makes a mistake in one of the <em>berachot</em>, such that it alters the essence of the <em>berachah</em>, is considered not to
    have recited that <em>berachah </em>at all<em>.</em> This holds true for one who omits the end of a <em>berachah</em>, or inserts words that do not belong
    at all, like requesting rain in the summer (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 119:3).
</p>
<p>
One who completes the <em>Amidah</em> and then remembers that he omitted words or erred in one of the <em>berachot</em> must repeat the entire    <em>Amidah</em>. Even if he has not yet taken three steps back, if he finished the prayers of supplication and is about to take steps backwards, he must
    return to the beginning of the <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:5).
</p>
<p>
    If he has not yet concluded the <em>Amidah</em> and remembers that he omitted words or made a mistake in one of the thirteen middle <em>berachot</em>, he
    must return to that <em>berachah</em> and continue praying from that point on, in the correct order. Even though he repeats the <em>berachot</em> that he
    already recited, since everything after that <em>berachah</em> was not recited in order, it is as if he did not say them at all, and he must recite them
    again in their correct sequence.
</p>
<p>
    If one skips words or errs in one of the first three <em>berachot</em>, or in one of the last three <em>berachot</em>, he must go back to the beginning of
    them. Since the first three <em>berachot</em> possess one theme, as do the last three <em>berachot</em>, (see earlier in this book 17:10), each section is
    considered one unit. Therefore, anyone who makes a mistake in one <em>berachah</em> is considered to have erred in all of them and must repeat all three of
    them from the beginning (<em>Berachot</em> 34a; <em>Rama</em> 114:6).
</p>
<p>
    The law concerning a person who interrupts <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> in the middle, whether with speech or silently, is as follows: if the interruption is
short, he continues praying from the point at which he stopped. However, if the interruption is long, enough that he could have finished praying the entire    <em>Amidah</em> from beginning to end, he returns to the start of the <em>Amidah</em>. Some say that there is no difference between an intentional
    interruption and one due to circumstances beyond his control. In either case, since there was enough time for him to finish the entire <em>Amidah</em>, he
    starts from the beginning (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 104:5). Others say that he only returns to the beginning of the <em>Amidah</em> if the interruption was
    due to circumstances beyond his control; however, if he interrupted willingly, even after a long interruption, he returns to pray from the place at which
    he stopped (<em>Rama</em> 65:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 104:16).<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>

<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. Additions Pertaining to Particular Days
</h2>
<p>
    On special days, prayers that pertain to that specific day are added. There are additions that, if forgotten, prevent one's fulfillment of his obligation,
    and there are additions that <em>l'chatchilah</em> must be recited, but <em>b'dieved</em>, if not included, do not prevent a person from fulfilling his
    obligation.
</p>
<p>
    On <em>Chol HaMo'ed </em>Pesach and Sukkot, the <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> prayer is added in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em>. If a person forgets to say it,
    he must repeat the <em>Amidah</em>. If he did not finish the <em>Amidah</em> yet, he goes back to <em>Retzeh</em>, recites <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>, and
from there continues on until the end of the <em>Amidah</em>. Similarly, we recite <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. If it was omitted in    <em>Shacharit</em> or <em>Minchah</em>, the <em>Amidah</em> must be repeated. However, if forgotten in <em>Ma'ariv</em> of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, it is not
    recited again, because when the new month was sanctified in Jerusalem based on the testimony of witnesses, there was no sanctification at night. Therefore,
    the sanctity of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> does not yet apply in <em>Ma'ariv </em>(<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 422:1).
</p>
<p>
    On <em>Motza'ei Shabbat</em> we add the <em>Havdalah</em> wording in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Attah Chonen</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>. If forgotten, it is not
    repeated since the person praying will fulfill his obligation afterwards, in the <em>Havdalah</em> ceremony performed over wine (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    294:1).
</p>
<p>
    On Chanukah and Purim, <em>Al HaNisim</em> is added in <em>Birkat HaHoda'ah</em>. If<em> </em>a person<em> </em>forgets to recite it, he does not go back,
since these holidays are rabbinic. Therefore, forgetting to mention them in the <em>Amidah</em> does not prevent one from fulfilling his obligation (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 682:1).
</p>
<p>
    On fast days, individuals add <em>Aneinu</em> in the <em>berachah</em> of <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>. <em>Ashkenazim</em> only recite it in <em>Minchah</em>
(<em>Rama</em> 565:3). <em>Sephardim</em> recite it throughout the whole fast: on Tish'ah B'Av - in <em>Ma'ariv</em>, <em>Shacharit</em>, and<em>Minchah</em>; on the other fast days - in <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 565:17). Some are accustomed to reciting it in    <em>Ma'ariv</em> on all fast days (<em>Rav Rakach</em>, <em>Maharitz</em>). According to all <em>minhagim</em>, one who forgets to say <em>Aneinu</em> does
    not repeat the <em>Amidah</em>.
</p>
<p>
During the Ten Days of Repentance, which are days of judgment, for during that time Hashem's Kingdom is revealed in the world, we conclude the third<em>berachah</em> with the words, "<em>HaMelech HaKadosh</em>," and conclude <em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashivah Shofteinu</em> with the words, "    <em>HaMelech HaMishpat</em>." If one mistakenly says "<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>" in the third <em>berachah</em> and does not correct himself as he recites it
    (<em>toch k'dei dibur</em>), he must return to the beginning of the <em>Amidah</em> since, as we already learned, the first three <em>berachot</em> are
considered one unit and anyone who makes a mistake in one of them must go back to the beginning. If a person accidentally concludes <em>Birkat</em>    <em>Hashivah Shofteinu</em> as usual, "<em>Melech ohev tzedakah u'mishpat</em>" and does not correct himself while reciting it (<em>toch k'dei dibur</em>),
    according to the custom of <em>Ashkenazim</em> and some <em>Sephardim</em>, <em>b'dieved</em> he fulfills his obligation, because even in the wording
recited throughout the whole year, the word "<em>Melech</em>" (King) is used (<em>Rama</em> 118:1; <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Nitzavim </em>19;    <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 1). Other <em>Sephardim</em> maintain that he does not fulfill his obligation because he did not recite the High Holy Days wording.
    Therefore, if he has not yet finished his <em>Amidah</em>, he must return to <em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashivah Shofteinu</em>, conclude it appropriately, and
    continue from there until the end of the <em>Amidah</em>. If he already finished reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, he must pray again, while stipulating that
if he was not obligated to repeat the prayer, the second prayer is considered voluntary (<em>nedavah</em>) (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 118:1;    <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 1:57).
</p>
<p>
There are four other additions made during the Ten Days of Repentance: "<em>Zochreinu</em>," "<em>Mi Kamocha</em>," "<em>U'chetov</em>," and "    <em>B'Sefer Chaim</em>." If any of them are forgotten, the <em>Amidah</em> is not repeated (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 582:5).
</p>
<p>
    If a person accidentally recites <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>, <em>Zochreinu</em>, or <em>Al HaNisim</em> on a regular weekday, he must go back to the beginning
of the <em>berachah</em>. If he already went on to the next <em>berachah</em>, he continues despite his mistake.    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. The Voluntary Prayer (<em>Tefillat Nedavah</em>) and Laws in Situations of Uncertainty
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted three daily prayers: <em>Shacharit</em>, corresponding to the morning<em> Tamid</em> offering; <em>Minchah</em>,
    corresponding to the <em>Tamid</em> of the afternoon; and <em>Ma'ariv</em>, corresponding to the raising of the organs and fats upon the altar. Just as
    when the Temple existed and every individual was permitted to bring voluntary offerings, so too, an individual is permitted to recite an additional
    voluntary <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. In order for his prayer to be recognized as voluntary, he must add some sort of special personal request in that prayer.
    We do not offer a <em>Musaf</em> offering voluntarily, therefore, one may not recite <em>Musaf</em> voluntarily. And just as we do not offer voluntary
    offerings on <em>Shabbatot</em> and festivals, so too, there are no voluntary prayers on those days (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 107:1-2). Anyone who wants to
    say a voluntary prayer must be certain that he is careful and capable of having <em>kavanah</em> in his prayer from beginning to end. If he cannot
    concentrate well, it is best that he does not recite a voluntary prayer at all (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 107:4). Nowadays, the accepted teaching is that we
    do not recite voluntary prayers because we do not have the proper <em>kavanah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    One who is uncertain as to whether or not he recited one of the three daily prayers, as long as the time for its recital has not yet passed, he recites the
    prayer and makes a stipulation in his heart. He thinks, "If I already prayed, this prayer is considered a voluntary prayer, and if not, this is an
    obligatory prayer." It is unnecessary to introduce any personal requests into that <em>Amidah</em>, since the fact that he is avoiding uncertainty is
    itself the innovation. Even though we do not recite voluntary prayers nowadays, we are permitted to do so in order to avoid uncertainty. If, in the middle
    of that <em>Amidah</em>, one remembers that he already prayed, he continues to recite the <em>Amidah</em> until the end and adds a personal request to
illustrate that it is, indeed, a voluntary prayer. This is allowed because he made a stipulation in the beginning of his prayer explaining that his    <em>Amidah</em> should be considered voluntary if, in fact, he already prayed.
</p>
<p>
If a person starts to pray on the basis that his prayer is obligatory, thinking that he did not yet pray, but suddenly remembers in the middle of his    <em>Amidah</em> that he already did, he must stop immediately. His prayer cannot become voluntary, for just like there is no offering that is partly
    obligatory and partly voluntary, so too, there is no prayer that begins as obligatory and ends as voluntary (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 107:1).
</p>
<p>
    One who is daydreaming in the middle of his prayer to the point where he is unsure what part of the <em>Amidah</em> he is reciting, for instance, a person
    who is pondering whether he is reciting the sixth <em>berachah</em> or the tenth, according to most <em>poskim</em>, in order to avoid uncertainty he must
    return to the sixth <em>berachah</em> and start to pray from that point on.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>

    <strong>Mentioning Rain and Praying for It</strong>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Mentioning and Asking for Rain
</h2>
<p>
    In the winter season, we mention rain twice in the <em>Amidah</em>. In the beginning, we mention rain in our praise of Hashem Who causes rain to fall;
    afterwards, we ask Hashem to bless us with dew and rain.
</p>
<p>
In the second <em>berachah</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>, <em>Mechayei HaMeitim</em>, we praise the One "Who makes the wind blow and the rain fall," ("    <em>Mashiv haru'ach u'morid hagashem</em>"). <em>Chazal</em> instituted mentioning the praise of rain in this particular <em>berachah</em> because rain
    gives life to the world.
</p>
<p>
In the ninth <em>berachah</em>, <em>Birkat HaShanim</em>, we request rain. According to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em>, the entire wording of<em>Birkat HaShanim</em> changes from winter to summer: in the winter we start with "<em>Barech Aleinu</em>" and in the summer we start with "    <em>Barcheinu Hashem Elokeinu</em>." According to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, the wording of <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> in the summer and in the winter
    is identical, with the exception of the words "<em>v'ten tal u'matar</em>" in the winter, and "<em>v'ten berachah</em>" in the summer.
</p>
<p>
    Although both the mention of rain and the request for it are recited in the winter, there is a difference between them. The mention of rain is recited at
    the appropriate season for rain, whereas the prayer for rain is only recited when we actually want rain to start falling.
</p>
<p>
    The mention of rain begins on the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Conceivably, rain could be mentioned from the beginning of Sukkot, since from then on, the
    period of rain begins. However, because rain is considered to be a sign of a curse on the holiday of Sukkot, for we cannot fulfill the mitzvah of sitting
    in the sukkah when it is raining, we therefore do not mention it then. <em>Chazal</em> chose the <em>Musaf</em> prayer of Shemini Atzeret as the point at
    which we begin to mention rain, for then the whole community comes to synagogue and the announcement of its recital can be made in the presence of
    everyone. <em>Ma'ariv</em> was not chosen because not everyone comes to synagogue for the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer<em>. </em>Likewise,<em> </em>it cannot be
announced before reciting the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Shacharit</em> because we are prohibited from interrupting between redemption and prayer (    <em>Beit Yosef </em>and<em> Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 114:1-2).
</p>
<p>
    However, the beginning of the <strong>request</strong> for rain was delayed fifteen days to the seventh night of the month of MarCheshvan. This is so that
    the last of the people returning home to the area of the Euphrates River from a Sukkot pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem, would arrive without
encountering rain on their way (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:1). Even after the destruction of Jerusalem, this custom was not abolished, since any    <em>minhag</em> that reminds us of the great days of the Temple is cherished. Only after the Temple is rebuilt will the <em>Sanhedrin</em> be able to
    determine whether or not to change the time that we start asking for rain, taking into consideration contemporary means of transportation.
</p>
<p>
    We continue to mention rain until the first day of Pesach; in <em>Shacharit</em> we still mention rain, but in <em>Musaf</em> we start mentioning dew.
Regarding the request for rain, since the request is only made on weekdays, it turns out that the last time we ask for rain is in <em>Minchah</em> of    <em>Erev Pesach</em>.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Law Regarding Errors in the Mention and Request for Rain
</h2>
<p>
    One who unintentionally <strong>mentions</strong> rain in the summer must go back and correct his mistake, since there is no praise in mentioning rain at
    that time. If he did not yet finish the <em>berachah</em>, he goes back to the beginning of it and says "<em>Morid hatal</em>," as should be recited in the
    summer. If he already finished the <em>berachah</em>, he must start the <em>Amidah</em> again from the beginning in order to recite it properly, since the
    first three <em>berachot</em> are considered one unit (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 114:4).
</p>
<p>
    One who mistakenly <strong>did not mention</strong> rain in the winter but instead mentioned dew, like we say in the summer, "<em>Morid hatal</em>," need
not repeat it since he recited some sort of praise relating to water. However, if he did not mention dew either, he must go back and repeat the entire    <em>Amidah</em>, since he omitted such important words of praise (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 114:5).
</p>
<p>
    One who incorrectly <strong>requests</strong> rain in the summer: since he made an inappropriate request in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em>,<em> </em>he must go
    back and correct it. Therefore, if he did not finish his <em>Amidah</em> yet, he returns to <em>Birkat HaShanim</em>, recites it properly, and continues in
    order from there until the end of the <em>Amidah</em>. If he already finished the <em>Amidah</em>, he recites the <em>Amidah</em> again properly from the
    beginning (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:3).
</p>
<p>
    If, by mistake, one <strong>did not request</strong> rain in the winter, it depends how much of the <em>Amidah</em> he already recited. If he did not yet
    reach <em>Birkat</em> <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>, he continues his prayer and when he arrives at <em>Birkat</em> <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>, in which one is
    permitted to make any request, he asks for rain, thereby correcting his mistake. However, if he already passed <em>Birkat</em> <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>,
    he missed the place in which he is able to correct himself and lost all the <em>berachot</em> that he recited after <em>Birkat HaShanim</em>. He must
    return to <em>Birkat HaShanim</em>, recite it in accordance with the halachah, and from then on continue to pray in the proper order. If he already
    finished the <em>Amidah</em> and was prepared to take three steps back, his prayer is considered insufficient since he did not request rain, and it must be
    repeated in the proper manner (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:4-5).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Advice Against Mistakes
</h2>
<p>
    The most frequent mistake made in the <em>Amidah</em> concerns the mention of, and the request for rain, because the wording is switched bi-annually.
    Throughout half the year, we become accustomed to a certain wording and tend to continue even though the time has come to change. As we learned, in three
    out of four possible errors regarding the request and mention of rain, we are obligated to repeat the prayer (see note 4).
</p>
<p>
    If a person is uncertain as to whether or not he recited the correct words, as long as thirty days have not passed since the change in wording, in the
    beginning of the summer or winter, we assume that he most likely erred, since he is still in the habit of using the earlier wording. If his mistake is one
    of the three that necessitate a repetition, he must go back and pray correctly. However, if thirty days already passed, when people become accustomed to
    the change in wording<em>; </em>we can assume that he most likely recited the correct wording, and he does not need to repeat the <em>Amidah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In order to be spared this uncertainty, following which it is necessary to go back and repeat the prayer, it is best that every person accustom himself to
    the new wording on the day of the change by repeating it ninety times, so that his tongue will get into the habit of reciting the new wording and he will
    not err. In that way, even if the person is in doubt whether or not he recited the proper wording, the assumption is that he must have recited it
correctly, since he already trained his tongue ninety times to say it in accordance with the halachah. Hence, it is unnecessary to repeat his prayer. (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 114:8-9).
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, when the seventh night of Cheshvan arrives, according to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em>, which maintains that the <em>nusach</em> of the entire
paragraph requesting rain changes, one should accustom himself to opening the <em>berachah</em> properly by reciting "<em>Rofei cholei Amo Yisrael</em>,<em> Barech aleinu</em>" ninety times. According to the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Ashkenazim</em>, he says, "<em>v'et kol minei tevuatah l'tovah</em>,<em> v'ten tal u'matar livrachah.</em>" Some six months later, when he arrives at the <em>Musaf</em> service of the first day of Pesach, he says, "    <em>Mechayei meitim Attah rav lehoshia</em>,<em> Morid hatal</em>" ninety times. On <em>motza'ei chag</em> before <em>Ma'ariv</em> of <em>Chol HaMo'ed</em>
, according to the Sephardic<em> minhag</em> he says, "<em>Rofei cholei Amo Yisrael</em>,<em> Barcheinu</em>" and according to the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em>, "<em>v'et kol mini tevuatah l'tovah</em>,<em> v'ten berachah</em>" (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 114:40; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 60).    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. The Law Outside of Israel
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> postponed the commencement of the request for rain in Babylonia (<em>Bavel</em>) until the sixtieth day of the winter season (which
    comes out to be the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> of December). This is because there is an abundance of water from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and
    therefore it is unnecessary to request rain in that area at the very beginning of winter. All people living outside of Israel follow the custom of
Babylonia, and start asking for rain starting from the sixtieth day of the season (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:1).    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    Regarding a person residing in Israel who leaves the country for a few months, there is disagreement. Some say that he should request rain as they do in
Israel, for that is his home (<em>Pri Chadash</em>). Others say that he should request rain according to the custom of the place where he is (<em>Birkei Yosef</em>). In any situation of uncertainty, one should request rain in the <em>berachah</em> of <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> and not in<em>Birkat HaShanim</em>, thereby fulfilling his obligation according to all opinions. See the note for details of the halachah.    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    In places that require rain in the spring, the request for rain in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> should not be continued after Pesach. Instead, the law
    concerning those places resembles the law of individuals; the people in those areas pray for rain in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> in which
    every person may add his own personal requests (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:2).<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    People living in countries south of the equator, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Australia, also request rain when it is winter in Israel. Despite the fact
    that it is summer in those countries at that time, since Israel is the center of the Jewish world, Jews everywhere follow its custom and make the request
    for rain according to winter in Israel.
</p>
<p>
    However, in places where the rain causes damage in the summer, the people do not practice the <em>minhag</em> of Israel, so as not to request something
that is harmful for them. Instead, all year round they recite the wording of the summer in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em>, and request rain in    <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>. During their winter they should have in mind the place in which they live, and during Israel's winter they should think of
    Israel.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
    One traveling from Israel, or the northern countries to visit those areas should continue requesting rain according to the winter of Israel, even if the
    rain causes damage there (<em>She'arim Metzuyanim BaHalachah</em> 19:3).

    <strong>The Supplementary Prayer (<em>Tashlumim</em>)</strong>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. Making Up a Forgotten Prayer
</h2>
<p>
A person who forgot to pray, or did not pray due to circumstances beyond his control, must make up the missed prayer. If he forgot to pray<em>Shacharit</em>, he makes it up after <em>Minchah</em>. First he prays <em>Minchah</em>, and after the last <em>Kaddish</em>, he recites the    <em>Amidah</em> again to make up for the missed <em>Shacharit</em>. If he wishes to pray the supplementary prayer together with the <em>Amidah</em>
    repetition, he is permitted to do so; however, he must be careful to pause between the two recitals of the <em>Amidah</em> for at least the amount of time
    that it takes to walk the distance of four <em>amot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If one forgets to pray <em>Minchah</em>, he makes it up after <em>Ma'ariv.</em> Following the last <em>Kaddish</em>, he recites the <em>Amidah</em> again
    as a supplementary prayer for the missed <em>Minchah</em>. If he forgets to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em>, he makes it up after <em>Shacharit</em>; either he prays
the supplementary <em>Ma'ariv Amidah</em> together with the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, or he recites it after the last <em>Kaddish</em> of    <em>Shacharit</em>.<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    Whoever forgets to recite a supplementary prayer after the obligatory <em>Amidah</em> can <em>b'dieved</em> make it up during the entire time specified to
recite that prayer. This means that if one does not pray a supplementary prayer for <em>Minchah</em> immediately after <em>Ma'ariv</em>, he can<em>b'dieved</em> make it up until <em>chatzot</em> (halachic midnight), since <em>l'chatchilah</em> that is the last possible time to pray    <em>Ma'ariv</em>. There are those who say that <em>b'dieved</em> it can be made up even until <em>amud hashachar</em>. If one did not pray the
    supplementary prayer for <em>Ma'ariv</em> immediately after he recited the <em>Amidah</em> for <em>Shacharit</em>, he can <em>b'dieved</em> make it up
    until the conclusion of four hours. If he did not pray the supplementary prayer for <em>Shacharit</em> immediately after the <em>Minchah Amidah</em>, he
    can <em>b'dieved</em> make it up until <em>bein hashemashot</em> (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:15; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 11). He should not wait until
    the end of the time to pray. Instead, he should stand and pray immediately upon remembering that he missed the supplementary prayer so as not to lengthen
    the interval between the obligatory prayer and the supplementary prayer. Even if he began to eat, he must immediately stop eating and pray the
    supplementary prayer (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:10).
</p>
<p>
    The person praying must be careful to pray the supplementary prayer after the obligatory one. If he intended to recite the first prayer as supplementary
    and the second as obligatory, he did not fulfill his obligation of the supplementary prayer, and he must pray a third <em>Amidah</em> in order to make up
for the forgotten prayer. For instance, if a person forgot to pray <em>Minchah</em> on Shabbat, and on <em>Motza'ei Shabbat</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> of<em>Ma'ariv</em> he did not recite the <em>Havdalah</em> wording, "<em>Attah Chonantanu</em>," having in mind that it is for the supplementary<em>Minchah</em>, whereas in his second <em>Amidah</em> he did recite the <em>Havdalah</em> wording, he must repeat the supplementary prayer for<em>Minchah</em>. However, if he mistakenly forgot to say <em>Attah Chonantanu</em> in the first <em>Amidah</em> and then remembers in the second<em>Amidah</em> and recites it, since he intended the first <em>Amidah</em> to be for <em>Ma'ariv</em> and the second to be as a supplement for    <em>Minchah</em>, he fulfilled his obligation.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>

    9. In What Situations Are Supplementary Prayers Not Recited?
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of a supplementary prayer solely to make up for the preceding prayer that was missed. Therefore, one who
missed both <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>, due to circumstances beyond his control, prays a supplementary prayer after <em>Ma'ariv</em> for    <em>Minchah </em>alone. If he desires, he may pray an additional voluntary prayer for the <em>Shacharit</em> that he missed (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    108:4-5), although nowadays we are not accustomed to praying voluntary prayers.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p>
    One who forgot to recite <em>Musaf</em> cannot make it up since the <em>Musaf</em> offerings are only brought on specific days. Similarly, one who forgot
    to pray <em>Shacharit</em> on a day that <em>Musaf</em> is recited, even though we learned that one must make up the prayer in the <em>Amidah</em>
    immediately following it, the <em>Musaf</em> prayer does not count and one must make up <em>Shacharit</em> after <em>Minchah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Someone who intentionally (<em>b'meizid</em>) missed one of the prayers cannot make it up. The <em>Rishonim</em> write that if he wants, he may recite it
    as a voluntary prayer (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 108:7). However, we already learned that today we are not accustomed to praying voluntary prayers, since one
    who does must be sure that he can concentrate throughout the whole prayer, from beginning to end (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 108:31).
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, one who did not recite <em>Minchah</em> or <em>Ma'ariv </em>when he still had the chance, thinking that after he finished the matter occupying
    his attention, time for prayer would remain, but was ultimately drawn into what he was doing, while the time to pray passed, is not considered to have
    purposely negated his prayer and must make it up after the next one. The law regarding a person who started to eat before praying, with the thought that he
    would have time to pray afterwards, but eventually forgot, is similar. Despite the fact that he started to eat when it was forbidden (earlier in this book
    12:6-7; 24:6; 25:9), since he did not contemptuously cancel his prayer, he makes it up after the next one (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 108:8). However,
    consider the case of a person engaged in a game, such as soccer, who was called to go pray lest the proper time pass. Out of his enthusiasm for the game,
    he said, "Just one more minute," and continued to play. Meanwhile, the time to pray passed. In such a case, he cannot make up his prayer. Were it not for
    the game, he would have been more than happy to pray. Nevertheless, since he knew for certain that the time to pray was about to lapse, he is, indeed,
    deemed one who scornfully neglected his prayer.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. Additional Laws and Cases of Uncertainty
</h2>
<p>
One who forgot to recite <em>Minchah</em> on <em>Erev Shabbat</em> must pray the <em>Ma'ariv</em> Shabbat <em>Amidah </em>twice, the first for    <em>Ma'ariv</em> and the second for the <em>Minchah</em> that he missed. Even though that <em>Minchah</em> was supposed to be a weekday <em>Amidah</em>
comprised of eighteen <em>berachot</em>, nevertheless, since the time to make it up falls on Shabbat, the wording of the Shabbat prayer is recited (    <em>Shulchan Aruch </em>108:9).
</p>
<p>
    One who forgot to recite <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> in <em>Minchah</em> of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> did not fulfill his obligation. If the following day is a
second day of <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, clearly he must pray a supplementary prayer after <em>Ma'ariv </em>for the missed <em>Minchah</em> and in both recite    <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>. However, if the evening already begins a regular day, there is doubt concerning this issue. On the one hand, if the whole problem
is that he did not mention <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> in <em>Minchah</em>, how would it help to pray another <em>Amidah</em> after <em>Ma'ariv </em>without    <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>? On the other hand, he did not fulfill his obligation for <em>Minchah</em>, since at that time it was <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> and he
    failed to recite <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>, whereas if he were to pray a supplementary prayer he would fulfill his obligation because he would recite the
    appropriate prayers for that specific time. In practice, the ruling is that one is to recite <em>Ma'ariv</em> twice and make a stipulation that if he is
    not obligated to make up the missed prayer, the additional prayer he is praying should be considered voluntary. There is no need to introduce any new
    personal requests at this time.
</p>
<p>
    The ruling is similar to the law regarding one who errs on Shabbat and instead of reciting <em>Minchah</em> of Shabbat recites the weekday wording without
    mentioning the sanctity of Shabbat. The law in that case requires that he recite two weekday <em>Amidah</em>s on <em>Motza'ei Shabbat</em> with a
    stipulation that if he is not obligated to make up the prayer, the additional prayer he is praying should be considered voluntary (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    108:11).

            The <em>poskim</em> disagree as to what the law is concerning a person who purposely (<em>b'meizid</em>) talks in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>
            . Some say (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Taz</em>, and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 104:33) that he is considered like anyone who interrupts in the middle
            of his prayer. Others say (<em>Bach</em>, <em>Magen Avraham</em>, and <em>Chayei Adam</em>) that since he interrupted intentionally, he rendered
            his prayer invalid and he must return to the beginning of the<em> Amidah</em>. See also <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 104:6.

            Some <em>poskim</em> say that since he recited words that do not belong there at all, he must go back to the beginning of the <em>berachah</em> in
            which he made the mistake. If he erred in the first three or last three <em>berachot</em>, he returns to the beginning of them. However, if he
            already finished the <em>Amidah</em>, he must start the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> again. This is on condition that he recited an outright falsity,
such as in <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>, the words "<em>b'Yom Rosh HaChodesh hazeh</em>" or in "<em>Zochreinu l'Chaim</em>", the words "<em>v'kotveinu</em>," when it is not the time of inscription (<em>ketivah</em>). However, if he only recited the beginning of<em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> or such similar additions, it is not considered an interruption and he continues praying. That is what the            <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em>, <em>Pri Chadash</em>, and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:37-38 write. In contrast, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 108:12
            maintains that even if one said, "<em>b'Yom Rosh HaChodesh hazeh</em>" or other similar words, even though it is incorrect, it is not considered an
            interruption. A number of prominent <em>Acharonim</em> agree with him, among them, <em>Magen Avraham</em> 693:1 and <em>Da'at Torah</em> 668, as
            well as <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 108:58. However, in practice, perhaps it is possible to say that even according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> one
            does not repeat other <em>berachot</em> for such a mistake. Only if he did not finish the <em>berachah</em> in which he erred does he go back to
            the beginning of it, but if he already finished, he does not repeat it. The same holds true for the first or last three <em>berachot</em>; he does
            not return to the beginning of all of them, rather only to the beginning of the specific <em>berachah</em> in which he made the mistake. Therefore,
in practice, it is not clear that he disagrees with the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> concerning a mistaken addition which requires reciting another            <em>berachah</em>, as I have written above.

According to the <em>Chayei Adam</em> 24:21, he starts from the <em>berachah</em> that he knows for certain he has not yet recited. However, most            <em>poskim</em> maintain that he must continue after the last <em>berachah</em> that he clearly remembers saying, so that there will be no doubt as
to whether or not he skipped one of the <em>berachot</em>. This is what is written in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 119:20, <em>Yabia Omer</em> 2:9, and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 1, p. 206.
        </p>
        <p>
Regarding a person who is uncertain as to whether or not he prayed at all and must pray another <em>Amidah</em> as a voluntary prayer, the            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 107:1 s.v. "<em>Im</em>" writes that in the opinion of the <em>Chayei Adam</em>, nowadays he may not pray a voluntary
            prayer even with a stipulation. However, this opinion is not accepted.

However, if he makes a mistake concerning the mention of rain in the period of transition from summer to winter, he does not need to repeat the            <em>Amidah</em>, for as we learned, even if he did not say "<em>Mashiv haru'ach u'morid hagashem</em>," but he mentioned dew, he fulfilled his
            obligation. Therefore, because "<em>Morid hatal</em>" (concerning dew) is recited in the summer, then even if he recited the summer wording, he
fulfilled his obligation. (Although the <em>Rama</em> 114:3 writes that "<em>Morid hatal</em>" is not said in the summer, in Israel the Ashkenazic            <em> minhag</em> is to say it.) However, in the transition period from winter to summer, if he erred, he invalidated his prayer, because that would
            mean he said "<em>Morid hagashem</em>" (regarding rain) in the summer. Any mistake a person makes concerning the request for rain renders his
            prayer invalid. To summarize, in three out of the four possibilities of error, it is necessary to repeat one's prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The source for the law that a person must repeat the <em>Amidah</em> in the first thirty days is in the <em>Yerushalmi</em> <em>Ta'anit</em>,
chapter 1, halachah 1. <em>Maharam of Rotenberg</em> advises to routinize one's tongue by saying the words ninety times. Although            <em>Rabbeinu Peretz</em> disagrees with him, the <em>Rosh</em> concurs, and that is also what <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules as well. However, this
            is slightly problematic, for in thirty days, the second <em>berachah</em> of the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> is recited approximately 100 times,
            because of the <em>Musaf</em> prayers on Shabbat, holidays, and <em>Chol HaMo'ed</em>, whereas <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> is said less than eighty
            times, since it is not recited on Shabbat or in <em>Musaf</em>. Indeed, some <em>poskim</em> maintain that the main point is to accustom oneself
            with ninety <em>Amidahs</em>, as the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> and <em>Derech HaChaim</em> write. In the opinion of the <em>Taz</em>, <em>Gra</em>,
            and other <em>Acharonim</em>, the essence is to recite the prayers of those thirty days, even if he did not accustom himself to the wording ninety
            times. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 114:37. In small paragraph 41 he writes in the name of the <em>Chatam Sofer</em> that <em>l'chatchilah</em> one
            should, indeed, accustom himself to the wording by reciting it 101 times. However, in practice, he concludes that if he only accustomed himself by
reciting it ninety times, it is not in our power to rule that he should repeat the <em>Amidah</em> against the ruling of the            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>. It seems that the reasoning behind the <em>Maharam</em>'s<em> </em>words<em> </em>is that there is no significant
            difference between 80, 90, or 100 times, yet the more one repeats it, the more he will familiarize his tongue. Since the <em>Yerushalmi</em>
            established that after thirty days one most probably does not err, he established that one's tongue can be trained by saying it ninety times, which
            is the average number of times the <em>Amidah</em> is recited in a month.

            In the countries closest to Israel, in which the climates are dry and more water is needed, it is customary to begin to request rain at the same
            time people in Israel do, on the eve of the seventh of Cheshvan. That is the custom even in far-away countries where the climate is similar to that
            of Israel, such as Djerba (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 117:4).

            The dispute of the <em>Acharonim</em> is explained in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 117:5. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 11 tends to agree with the opinion
            of the <em>Birkei Yosef</em> who maintains that one requests rain as they do in the place where he is at that time. Many mention the advice that
one should make his request in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> (<em>Tefillah KeHilchatah</em> p. 235; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 117:15;            <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 23:37). In that way, he fulfills his obligation according to all, since even when there is an obligation to ask for rain,
            the request can be made up in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> if missed, and on the other hand, even if it is not the proper time to make such a request,
            if he asked for rain in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>, he need not repeat his prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Details of certain laws: An Israeli who leaves the country:</strong>
            1) If he leaves before the seventh of Cheshvan, he asks for rain in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> starting from the seventh of Cheshvan. 2) If he
leaves after the seventh of Cheshvan, since he already began requesting rain, he continues to do so in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> (            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 13, in the name of <em>Kesher Shel Gudal</em>). 3) If he leaves with his family for more than a year, he is considered at that
            time to be a resident of a different country and he follows the custom there.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>A person from a different country who comes to Israel</strong>
            : it is better that he practices like those in Israel, and therefore if he intends to return to his country after the day on which it is necessary
            to start requesting rain there, he requests rain as those in Israel do. If he intends to return before the day that it is necessary to start
            requesting rain there, some say he makes his request in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>. Others say that he requests as they do in Israel. When he
returns to his country, he does not need to continue the request for rain, but it is good to do so in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> (            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 117:17).
        </p>
        <p>
In all these laws, it seems that if one erred and practiced according to one of the outlined opinions (and did not make his request in            <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>), he need not repeat his prayer. Concerning a <em>chazan</em>, even if he requests rain in <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> in
            his silent <em>Amidah</em>, he prays the repetition according to the custom of the place in which he resides, because it is a prayer on behalf of
            the congregation (<em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 23:39).

            If he mistakenly requested rain in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> in a place that needs rain after Pesach, according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 117:2
            he must repeat his prayer with a stipulation that if the halachah follows the <em>Rosh</em>'s reasoning, then it would be permitted for the
residents of that place to ask for rain in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> and, indeed, this prayer is a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat</em>            <em>nedavah</em>). According to the <em>Rama</em>, <em>b'dieved</em> he is not obligated to repeat the <em>Amidah</em>. If he realized in the
            middle of his prayer that he requested rain in <em>Birkat HaShanim</em> at the wrong time, the <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 2, <em>Orach Chaim</em>
9:17, based on the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, writes that he must immediately go back and correct his mistake. However, according to the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 10, since <em>b'dieved</em> he fulfills his obligation even after saying it, he concludes his prayer and if he wishes to
            repeat his prayer, he prays another <em>Amidah</em> as a voluntary prayer. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 25 writes that he finishes his prayer and
            afterwards recites another voluntary<em> Amidah</em>.

            in <em>Torat Chaim</em> 3:7; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 117:17, and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 23:42. <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 30 writes that even when

            The <em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to whether or not it is permissible to fulfill one's obligation of a supplementary prayer (<em>tashlumim</em>)
            by hearing the <em>chazan</em>'s repetition of the <em>Amidah</em>. According to the <em>Pri Megadim</em> and the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:5,
            since it is an obligation to pray a supplementary <em>Amidah</em>, one who knows how to pray by himself cannot fulfill his obligation by hearing
            the repetition. According to the <em>Chida</em>, it is permissible to fulfill one's obligation of the supplementary <em>Ma'ariv Amidah</em> by
            hearing the <em>Shacharit</em> <em>Amidah</em> repetition, since in essence <em>Ma'ariv</em> is optional. That is also how <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            108:6 rules, but he adds that a verification must be made that the <em>chazan</em>, indeed, has <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill the obligation of those
            who are listening to his repetition, as written in <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 108:7. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, too, is lenient <em>b'dieved</em>,
and rules that if a person has <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation of a supplementary <em>Ma'ariv</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> repetition of<em>Shacharit</em>, he does fulfill it. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 108:16 is completely lenient, meaning that in the <em>Amidah</em> repetition of            <em>Minchah</em> as well, one can fulfill his obligation if he missed the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer. Regarding the <em>chazan</em> himself,
everyone agrees that the <em>Amidah</em> repetition that he recites can effectively be considered as his supplementary prayer (            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:4).
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems that when the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 108:2 writes that a person prays again after <em>Shacharit</em>, he is referring specifically to one
            who is praying individually. However, if he is praying in a <em>minyan</em>, it is preferable that he prays his supplementary prayer together with
the <em>chazan</em>'s <em>Amidah</em> repetition or after the last <em>Kaddish</em>, for if he does not, he loses out on responding to some of the            <em>Kaddishim</em> as well as reciting<em> Kedushah d'Sidra</em>.

The majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that everything depends on the person's <em>kavanah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:28, unlike the<em>Taz</em>). The <em>Magen Avraham</em> and <em>Taz</em> are doubtful concerning a case in which a person has <em>kavanah</em> in the first            <em>Amidah</em> for <em>tashlumim</em> and the second one as an obligation, but he did not recite <em>Attah Chonantanu</em> and lacks tangible
            proof that he prayed the second <em>Amidah</em> as the obligatory prayer. Therefore, perhaps he does not need to repeat his prayer. Nevertheless,
            the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and most <em>poskim</em> is that he must repeat the <em>Amidah</em>, and that is the halachah. It is
            best that he make a stipulation that if he is not obligated to recite this prayer, his prayer is considered voluntary (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            108:7; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 1, p. 214).

            According to the <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Rashbam</em>, and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, it is only
permissible to make up the last prayer. Others say that he may make up all the prayers that he missed, as writes the <em>Rashba</em> and "            <em>yesh omrim</em>" in <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> writes that it is good to make up all the prayers as
            voluntary (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>). However, since today we are not accustomed to praying voluntary prayers, it seems that only one who is
            certain that he will have the proper <em>kavanah</em> may pray a voluntary prayer to make up a missed <em>Amidah</em>.
