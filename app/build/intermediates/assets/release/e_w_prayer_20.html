            1. Men’s Obligation to Pray with a <em>Minyan</em> and in a
            Synagogue
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages ordained that men pray with a <em>minyan </em>(a quorum of
        ten adult men) in a synagogue. The Sages teach that the divine Presence
dwells wherever ten Jews engage in sacred matters (<em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>), as Scripture states: "        <em>Elokim nitzav ba-adat Kel</em>" ("God stands in a godly
        congregation"; Tehilim 82:1), and ten Jews constitute an "<em>edah</em>
" (congregation). Although even when one Jew prays or studies Torah the        <em>Shekhina</em> is present, there are nevertheless different
        gradations, the highest level of which is when ten Jews are engaged in
        a <em>davar she-bikdusha</em>, for then holiness is revealed in the
        world (see <em>Berakhot</em> 6a). Based on this, the Sages ordained
        that all <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>, that is, enactments that
        express God’s sanctity publicly, shall be recited in a <em>minyan</em>
of ten men. <em>Devarim she-bikdusha</em> encompasses <em>Ĥazarat</em><em>Ha-shatz</em>, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, <em>Barkhu</em>,        <em>Kaddish</em>, and Torah reading (<em>Megilla</em> 23b).
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The<em> </em>Sages further taught that when one prays with a<em>minyan</em>, her prayers are accepted. Even if she lacks full        <em>kavana</em>, her prayers are accepted because she prays with the
        congregation (<em>be-tzibur</em>) (see <em>Berakhot</em> 8a). Praying
with a <em>minyan </em>is thus superior in two ways: the        <em>Shekhina </em>is with the <em>minyan</em>, which makes prayer more
acceptable, and in a <em>minyan </em>one recites all the        <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em> that the Sages ordained for recitation
specifically with a <em>minyan</em> of men (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 2:1-3). Since the <em>Shekhina</em>
        dwells in the midst of a <em>minyan</em>, it is proper for every person
        to try to be one of the first ten people to pray together, for it is
        because of them that the <em>Shekhina</em> appears.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When the <em>minyan</em> prays in a synagogue its advantages are
        twofold, for the prayer is conducted in a place specifically designated
        for <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em> (<em>Berakhot</em> 6a; 8a). A
synagogue is called a "small sanctuary" ("<em>mikdash me</em>’        <em>at</em>," from Yeĥezkel 11:16, which R. Yitzĥak interpreted to
        refer to "synagogues and study halls" [<em>Megilla</em> 29a]), for its
        holiness is a reflection of the Temple’s sanctity.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
It is thus apparent that prayer with a congregation (        <em>tefila be-tzibur</em>) is on some level a substitute for the Temple
        service: The <em>Shekhina</em> dwells in a place of ten Jews, the
        sanctity of the synagogue resembles the holiness of the Temple, and the
        communal prayers were ordained to correspond to the public sacrificial
        offerings.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Reish Lakish says: One who has a synagogue in his city but does not
        enter it to pray is called a bad neighbor. Not only that, he brings
        exile upon himself and his descendants. Those who come early to the
        synagogue for <em>Shaĥarit</em> and leave late after <em>Ma’ariv</em>
        merit long life (<em>Berakhot</em> 8a; SA 90:11).

2. Women are Exempt from Praying in a Synagogue and with a            <em>Minyan</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
As we learned (above, 11:1), a woman need not pray with a        <em>minyan</em> or in a synagogue, because the prayer in a synagogue is
time-dependent, and women are exempt from positive time-bound<em>mitzvot</em>. Although we learned that communal prayer (        <em>tefila be-tzibur</em>) is of great quality, women have other roles,
        no less important (as explained above, in chapter 3), and therefore
        they need not pray in a synagogue and with a <em>minyan</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Still, it is clear that a woman who prays with a <em>minyan</em> and in
a synagogue earns merit, because she prays in a holy place where the        <em>Shekhina</em> dwells and because she has the privilege of answering
"amen" to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>, reciting<em>Kedusha</em> and <em>Modim</em>, and hearing        <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Midrash (<em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>,<em> Ekev</em> 871) relates a
        story about a woman who became so aged that she no longer wished to
        live. She came before R. Yossi b. Ĥalafta and said to him, "My master,
        I have grown too old. My life has become dismal; I can taste neither
        food nor drink, and I want to be done with this world." He replied,
        "What mitzva are you careful to perform every day?" She answered, "Even
        if there is something dear to me, I always put it aside and go early to
        the synagogue every day." He said to her, "Stay away from the synagogue
        for three consecutive days." So she did, and on the third day she
        became ill and died. We infer from here that one’s diligence in going
        to the synagogue daily causes long life, and that this advantage
        applies to women as well.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages also tell of a woman who had a synagogue in her neighborhood
        but who would walk every day to R. Yoĥanan’s more distant synagogue. He
        asked her: "My daughter, isn’t there a synagogue in your neighborhood?
        Why do you come all the way here?" She replied, "Master, do I not
        receive more reward for each stride?" (<em>Sota</em> 22a). We learn a
        law from here: when a more distant synagogue is superior, one who walks
there is rewarded for each pace (MA 90:22;        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3 n. 3).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Nevertheless, it is clear that the mitzva for a woman to pray with a        <em>minyan</em> is of secondary importance to caring for her family.
        Whenever there is a conflict between prayer in a synagogue and care for
        the children and family, family comes first. However, unmarried women,
        girls, and women with adult children and no grandchildren at home
should make an effort to attend the synagogue on Shabbat and        <em>Yom Tov</em>. It is therefore appropriate that we study some rules
        and laws concerning prayer with a <em>minyan</em>.

        <a name="_Toc402175312">3. <em>Kaddish</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Kaddish</em>
is unique in that it deals primarily with God’s honor (        <em>kevod Shamayim</em>), and therefore, one’s response must be with
        intense <em>kavana</em>, and one certainly should not chatter during
        its recitation (SA 56:1; MB 1). The Sages<em> </em>say that anyone who
        answers "<em>Amen</em>,<em> Yehei Shemei Rabba Mevorakh</em>…" ("May
        His great name be blessed…") with their full powers of concentration
will cause a judgment of even seventy years against him to be torn up (        <em>Shabbat</em> 119b; <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>). They further
say that when Jews enter the synagogues and recite "        <em>Yehei shemei rabba mevorakh</em>.." aloud, harsh decrees against
        them are nullified (<em>Tosafot ad loc.</em>, citing<em> Pesikta</em>).
        Additionally, they say that the answer to <em>Kaddish</em> arouses
mercy for Jews in exile. When Jews enter synagogues and<em>batei midrashot</em> and respond, "        <em>Yehei shemei rabba mevorakh</em>…," the memory of those in exile
        ascends before God, and He shakes His head in pain, so to speak, and
        says: "Fortunate is the king who was glorified this way in his house,"
and the desire to redeem Israel awakens before Him (see        <em>Berakhot</em> 3a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Since we sanctify God in <em>Kaddish</em>, it must be recited with a        <em>minyan</em>, for God is only sanctified by an "<em>edah</em>" (a
        group) of Jewish people. <em></em>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Kaddish</em>
        was composed in Aramaic because that was the language spoken by all
        Israel during the Second Temple era, and therefore even the uneducated
        could understand it and have <em>kavana</em> in their response. The
        following is a translation of the prayer:
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Magnified and sanctified may His great name be,
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        in the world which He created by His will.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        May He establish His kingdom,

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        cultivate His salvation, and bring His messiah near,

    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        and say: Amen.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The congregation then responds: "        <em>Yehei shemei rabba mevorakh le-alam u-le’almei almaya</em>," ("May
        His great bame be blessed forever and all time.") The <em>ĥazan</em>
        continues:
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Blessed and praised, glorified and exalted,

That it is the main part of the <em>Kaddish</em>, also called Half-        <em>Kaddish</em>, and responding to it is of utmost importance, more

        <a name="_Toc402175313">4. The Various Kinds of <em>Kaddish</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There are four versions of <em>Kaddish</em>, which we will identify by
        name. 1)<strong> Half-<em>Kaddish </em></strong>corresponds to the main
        section of <em>Kaddish</em>. It is called Half-<em>Kaddish</em> to
        distinguish it from the other <em>Kaddishim</em> which contain further
        additions. In any part of prayer in which <em>Kaddish</em> must be
said, but there should not be prolonged interruption, Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited; 2)<strong><em>Kaddish Shalem </em></strong>(Full-<em>Kaddish </em>or        <em>Kaddish Yehei Shelama</em>) is recited after saying verses from
        Tanakh and contains an added request for peace and good life for us and
all Israel. It concludes: "<em>Oseh shalom bi-mromav, Hu </em>(<em>be-raĥamav</em>)        <em> ya’aseh shalom aleinu ve-al kol (amo) Yisrael ve-imru: </em>Amen"
        ("May He Who makes peace in His high places make peace (in His mercy)
for us and all of (His nation) Israel – and say: Amen"). Since this<em>Kaddish</em> is usually recited by mourners, it is also called<em>Kaddish Yatom</em> (Mourner’s <em>Kaddish</em>); 3)<strong><em>Kaddish Titkabel </em></strong>is recited by the        <em>ĥazan</em> after the conclusion of the <em>Amida</em>. It is
        identical to <em>Kaddish Shalem</em> but for a single additional line
that asks for our prayers be accepted; 4)        <strong><em>Kaddish De-rabanan </em></strong>is recited after the study
of rabbinic teachings. It too is identical to <em>Kaddish</em>        <em>Shalem</em> but with the addition of a prayer that those who study
        Torah be granted long, good lives.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages ordained the recitation of <em>Kaddish</em> at the conclusion
        of each section of communal prayer. <em>Kaddish De-rabanan</em> is
recited after <em>Korbanot,</em>; Half-<em>Kaddish</em> after        <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>; Half-<em>Kaddish</em> after <em>Taĥanun</em>
        ; On Mondays and Thursdays, an additional Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is
recited after Torah reading; <em>Kaddish Titkabal</em> is recited after<em>Kedusha De-sidra</em>; <em>Kaddish Shalem </em>is recited after        <em>Shir shel Yom</em>; and <em>Kaddish De-rabanan</em> is recited
        after <em>Pitum Ha-ketoret</em> (<em>Shibolei Ha-leket</em> §8). The
        recitation of <em>Kaddish</em> concludes and elevates each section of
        the prayer service toward the ultimate objective – God’s honor – so
        that we may begin the next section.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The general practice is that mourners recite <em>Kaddish Shalem</em>
after the recitation of verses from Tanakh<em> </em>and        <em>Kaddish De-rabanan</em> after studying rabbinic works, since the
        departed souls benefits from <em>Kaddish</em> recited for the purpose
        of its elevation (see below, sections 18-19). When no mourner is
        present, one who lost a parent recites the <em>Kaddish</em>. If nobody
        present has lost a parent, the common custom is to refrain from
        reciting those <em>Kaddishim</em> (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>,
        23:8 n. 9).

    <a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175314">5. <em>Barkhu</em></a>
        <em> </em>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Before <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, the <em>ĥazan</em> says, "        <em>Barkhu et Hashem ha-mevorakh</em>" ("Bless God, the blessed One"),
and the congregation responds, "        <em>Barukh Hashem ha-mevorakh le-olam va’ed</em>" ("Blessed is God, the
blessed one, forever and all time"), and the <em>ĥazan</em> repeats, "        <em>Barukh Hashem ha-mevorakh le-olam va’ed</em>" (SA 57:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When the <em>ĥazan</em> says "<em>Barkhu</em>," he bows a bit, and when
        saying "<em>Hashem</em>" he straightens up. Regarding the congregation,
        there are different customs. Some customarily bow down completely,
        others bow slightly, and still others do not bow at all. Everyone
        should follow family custom. When people with different customs pray
together, it is proper for everyone to bow slightly (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 17 n. 3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The primary purpose of <em>Barkhu</em> is to introduce<em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, for by declaring "<em>Barkhu</em>," the<em>ĥazan</em> invites the congregation to recite        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>. Likewise, those called up to the Torah
        recite <em>Barkhu</em> as an introduction to <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is customary to repeat <em>Barkhu</em> at the end of the prayer
        service so that latecomers who missed the first <em>Barkhu </em>have
        the opportunity to respond to it (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>,
        16:3 n. 2; 23:9).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
There are different customs of standing when responding to        <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barkhu.</em> According to the custom of most
Sephardim, there is no need to stand while responding to        <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>, though but one who is already standing
must remain standing for <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barkhu</em> (Maharil,        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 56:20; 146:20-21; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 3:4).
        Most Ashkenazim customarily stand while responding to <em>Kaddish</em>
and <em>Barkhu</em> (MB 56:7-8; 146:18). However, concerning        <em>Barkhu</em>, which requires a short answer, many Ashkenazim have a
        practice that if they are already sitting, such as during Torah reading
        or before <em>Ma’ariv</em>, they do not completely stand up. Rather,
        they rise slightly from their seats while bending their heads forward
        chairs, this rising and bowing a bit while answering. Many have a
        similar custom when answering a <em>zimun</em> of ten men, for although
        it is a <em>davar she-bikdusha </em>for which it is proper to stand
        according to Ashkenazic custom, since its recitation is short, it is
        sufficient to slightly rise instead of completely stand.

        <a name="_Toc402175315">6. <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Men of the Great Assembly ordained that after individuals finish
reciting the silent <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, the        <em>shali’aĥ tzibur </em>(abbreviated to "<em>shatz</em>" an meaning
"envoy of the community"; it refers to the<em> ĥazan</em>) repeats the        <em>Amida</em> out loud in order to fulfill the obligation on behalf of
        those who do not know how to pray on their own (RH 34b). This
repetition is known as <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz</em>. However, for        <em>Ma’ariv</em>, they did not institute an <em>Amida</em> repetition
        since, technically, <em>Ma’ariv</em> is voluntary and consequently
        there is no need to fulfill the mitzva on behalf of those who are not
        well-versed in the prayer service.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The Sages ordained that the <em>ĥazan</em> also prays the silent        <em>Amida</em> in order to prepare for his repetition. They also
instructed that even those who know how to pray on their own listen to<em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em> and answer "amen" after every        <em>berakha</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Because <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz</em> was ordained by the Sages,
        it must be recited even where the congregants know how to pray on their
        own. Even now that it is permissible to put the Oral Torah, including
        the prayers, in writing, and even now that <em>siddurim</em> are so
        ubiquitous that it is rare to find a <em>minyan </em>where someone
        needs <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz </em>to fulfill his obligation, the
        Sages’ enactment remains in force. The principle in play is that once
        the Sages enact a law, they do not distinguish between individual cases
        (SA 124:3, based on <em>Responsa Rambam</em>). Moreover, the Sages
instituted <em>Kedusha</em> and <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> in        <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz</em>, and if the <em>Amida</em> is not
        repeated, they will be abolished altogether (<em>Tur</em>).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Kabbalistic literature explains that in addition to the simple
        explanation – that it allows the uneducated to fulfill their obligation
        – there is another, esoteric reason. It is necessary for there to be a
        silent <em>Amida </em>as well as <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz</em>
        because through both of them together, prayer is most effective.
        Therefore, even where there is no need to fulfill the obligation on
        behalf of one who is not well-versed though <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz,</em>
we must recite it, for the esoteric reason remains. <em>Ĥazarat</em><em>Ha-shatz</em> is of even greater value than the silent<em>Amida </em>as it is collective and the congregation answers<em>Amen</em> to its <em>berakhot</em>. Hence, although the        <em>Amida</em> is intense and sublime, and in order to preserve its
exaltedness one recites it silently, the <em>ĥazan</em> recites        <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em> aloud, for due to its even greater value no
        concern that the <em>kelipot </em>("husks"; a kabbalistic term for the
forces of evil) will take hold of it (see SA 124:7;        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 124:2 and 16).

    <p dir="LTR">
        Three conditions must be present for an individual to fulfill his
        obligation by hearing <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz</em>: 1) the
        individual must not be proficient in prayer; one who knows how to pray
        must pray and beg for mercy on his own. She is unable to fulfill his
obligation by hearing the <em>ĥazan</em>; 2) there must be a        <em>minyan</em>, because the Sages instituted that individuals may only
        fulfill their obligation by hearing the <em>ĥazan</em> in the presence
of a <em>minyan</em>; 3) the listener must understand the        <em>ĥazan</em>’s words; one who does not understand Hebrew is unable to
        fulfill his obligation with <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz.</em>

    <p dir="LTR">
        The audience, even those who prayed individually, must take care to

        responds "amen" is greater than the one who recites the blessing.’
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
One must respond "amen" with the utmost solemnity and have        <em>kavana</em> that the content of the <em>berakha</em> is true. For
        instance, if one hears <em>Ha-Kel Ha-Kadosh</em>, she must have in
mind: "It is true that the Lord is the holy God." When the        <em>berakha </em>includes a request, she should also think, "if only
the request would be accepted." For example, one who hears        <em>Ĥonen Ha-da’at</em> should have two things in mind: 1) it is true
        that God grants knowledge; 2) "if only God would grant us knowledge"
        (SA<em> </em>124:6; MB 25).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Here is the place to expand a bit on the laws of answering "amen" to
the <em>berakhot </em>of <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em> and to all        <em>berakhot</em> in general. "Amen" should be recited in a pleasant
        tone, and one’s voice should not be raised above that of the person
        reciting the <em>berakha</em> (SA 124:12). One must not shorten the
"amen," but extend it for the amount of time it takes to say "        <em>Kel Melekh Ne’eman</em>," although it should not be overly
        extended.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
One may not recite "amen" too early, that is, before the        <em>berakha </em>is completed; this is called an <em>Amen Ĥatufa</em>.
        Nor may one shorten the "amen" by slurring its syllables or tailing off
        before fully articulating it; this is called an <em>Amen Ketufa</em>.
        Nor may one delay saying "amen" for too long once the <em>berakha </em>
        has been concluded; this is called an <em>Amen</em> <em>Yetoma</em> (an
        orphaned <em>Amen</em>) (see <em>Berakhot</em> 47a; SA 124:8).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The way one responds "amen" corresponds to one’s faith in God. Because
        our lives depend on God, a defect in one’s faith produces a defect in
        his life. This is the meaning of Ben Azai’s statement: "Whoever
        responds with an <em>Amen Yetoma</em> – his children will be orphans;
        an <em>Amen</em> <em>Ĥatufa</em> – his days will be snatched from him;
        an <em>Amen Ketufa</em> – his days will be abbreviated. However, if one
        prolongs the recitation of "amen" – his days and years are lengthened"
        (<em>Berakhot</em> 47a).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The greatest Rishonim customarily said "        <em>barukh Hu u-varukh shemo</em>" ("blessed is He, and blessed is His
        name") when God’s name was mentioned in a <em>berakha</em>. This
practice became widespread throughout Jewry, but it applies only        <em>berakhot</em> that do not constitute the fulfillment of one’s
        personal obligation, such as <em>Ĥazarat</em> <em>Ha-shatz</em> for one
        who has already prayed silently. However, <em>berakhot</em> through
which one fulfills a personal obligation, such as the        <em>berakhot </em>on <em>kiddush</em> and blowing the<em> shofar</em>,
        the common practice is not to recite "<em>barukh Hu u-varukh shemo</em>
        ," so as not to interrupt the <em>berakha</em> with words not ordained
by the Sages. Nevertheless, <em>be-di’avad</em>, if one responded "        <em>barukh Hu u-varukh shemo</em>" in a <em>berakha</em> that she was
        obligated to recite, she has still fulfilled her obligation, since her
response did not distract her from the <em>berakha</em> (MB 124: 21;        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 26; some North African communities customarily
        respond even during <em>berakhot </em>through which one fulfills an
        obligation, whereas Yemenite custom is never to recite it at all).

        <em>Kedusha</em>
        is recited in the third <em>berakha</em> of <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>.
        The essence of the <em>Kedusha</em> is the congregation’s response with
the verses: "<em>Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh</em>,        <em>Hashem Tzevakot, melo kol ha-aretz kevodo</em>" ("Holy, holy, holy
        is the Lord of hosts; the whole world is filled with His glory";
        Yeshayahu 6:3), "<em>Barukh kevod Hashem mi-mkomo</em>" ("Blessed be
the Lord’s glory from His place"), and "        <em>Yimlokh Hashem Le-olam…</em>" ("The Lord shall reign forever…;
        Tehilim 146:10). The custom today, based on Arizal, is for the
congregation to recite the connecting passages as well. The        <em>ĥazan</em> then repeats them aloud, and the congregation responds
with the verses of the <em>Kedusha</em> (MB 125:2;        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is best to stand with one’s feet together for <em>Kedusha</em>,
        since we recite this <em>Kedusha</em> like the angels whose legs are so
        close together that they resemble one leg (SA 125:2). There are those
        who beautify the practice by remaining with their legs together until
        the end of <em>Ha-Kel Ha-Kadosh</em> (<em>Eliya Rabba</em> 125:6);
        however, this is not an obligation.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is customary to raise one’s heels slightly and turn one’s closed
        eyes upward when reciting the words "<em>Kadosh</em>" (all three
        times), "<em>Barukh</em>," and "<em>Yimlokh</em>," thereby expressing
        the desire to transcend and soar upward (<em>Beit Yosef</em> and Rema
        125:2; MB 6; and <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 2 and 9, which state that some
        people keep their eyes open).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When the <em>ĥazan</em> reaches <em>Modim</em>, the whole congregation
bows with him and recites <em>Modim De-rabanan</em>, whose<em>nusaĥ</em> differs from that of the <em>Modim</em> in the        <em>Amida</em>, as clarified in the Talmud (<em>Sota</em> 40a). This
bow must be in accordance with the laws of <em>Modim</em> in the silent        <em>Amida</em> (MB 127:2; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 1; see above, 12:5).

            Matters of Sanctity?
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        We already learned that it is forbidden to interrupt by speaking in the
middle of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and <em>Shema</em> and its        <em>berakhot</em>. However, for an urgent matter, such as to prevent
        damage or insult, it is permissible to interrupt (see above, 16:14;
        15:6). Thus, just as one may interrupt for an important matter, so too
        one may interrupt to respond to <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>.
Therefore, if one is reciting <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> or<em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em> and hears <em>Kaddish</em>,        <em>Barkhu</em>, <em>Kedusha</em>, or <em>Modim</em> may answer.
        However, she is not obligated to stop and respond, as one who is
reciting <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> is already occupied with        <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>, and there is no affront to God’s honor
        if she continues her prayer. However, if she is surrounded by women who
        are responding to <em>Kedusha</em> and <em>Modim</em>, it is proper
        that she stop and answer together with them, because those responses
        are accompanied by an act (standing with feet together and bowing), and
        if she would continue sitting, she would appear to be separating
        herself from the congregation. Once she must interrupt her prayer to
        stand or bow with them, it is preferable that she answer with them.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The permissibility of interrupting one’s prayer to respond to        <em>Kaddish</em> applies only to the central part of <em>Kaddish </em>
        (that which is recited in the Half-<em>Kaddish</em>). She does not
respond to the later additions, for they are not the essence of<em>Kaddish</em>. Likewise, clearly one must not interrupt to respond "        <em>Barukh Hu u-varukh shemo</em>," as this response is mere custom.

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Regarding answering "amen" to <em>berakhot</em>, such as the<em>berakhot</em> of <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>: While reciting<em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> one may answer, but not while reciting<em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em> (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 14:4 n. 7; 16:5 n. 4).

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
In cases where one may respond in the middle of        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, she may only respond while reciting the
        main part of it, from the beginning until just before the conclusion.
        However, once one says "<em>Barukh Atta Hashem</em>" at the conclusion,
she may not interrupt at all, for such an interruption truncates the        <em>berakha</em> (BHL 66:3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Similarly, when reciting the verses "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>…" and "        <em>Barukh Shem kevod…</em>," in which one accepts the yoke of heaven,
        one may not interrupt for anything, for they have the same status as
        the <em>Amida</em>, in which we do not interrupt at all (SA 66:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
In any case of uncertainty in the middle of        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> or <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, it is best
        not to respond, for according to many <em>poskim</em>, even if it is
permissible to respond, there is no obligation to do so (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 16 n. 4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
In the middle of the <em>Amida</em> it is forbidden to respond to any<em>davar she-bikdusha</em>, including <em>Kaddish</em> and        <em>Kedusha</em>. However, one may remain silent and be attentive to
        the <em>ĥazan</em>’s<em> Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedusha</em>, for
        listening with <em>kavana</em> is considered like actually responding.
        However if interrupting the <em>Amida </em>to listen to <em>ĥazan</em>
disturbs her <em>kavana</em>, it is better that she continue her silent        <em>Amida</em> (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 17:15).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        On weekdays, one must not interrupt between <em>Ga’al Yisrael</em> and
        the <em>Amida </em>for any <em>davar she-bikdusha</em>, for adjoining
        redemption to prayer helps save people from distress. However, on
        Shabbat, which is not considered a day of distress, there is less of a
necessity to adjoin redemption to prayer, and according to most<em>poskim</em> one may interrupt to respond to        <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>. On festivals, which are days of judgment
        (on Sukkot, we are judged regarding water, on Pesaĥ regarding the
        harvest, and on Shavuot regarding tree fruits – see RH 16a), one may
not interrupt between redemption and prayer (SA 66:9; Rema 111:1;        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 16 n. 7).

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There is a positive biblical commandment for <em>kohanim</em> to bless
        the nation of Israel, as it is written: "God spoke to Moshe, saying:
        Speak to Aharon and his sons, saying: This is how you shall bless the
        Israelites. Say to them: May the Lord bless you and guard you. May the
        Lord make His face shine on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord
        turn His face toward you and grant you peace" (Bamidbar 6:22-26).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In this blessing, called <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, we learn to notice
        the basic fact that God is the bestower of blessing upon us, and our
        daily receptivity to <em>Birkat</em> <em>Kohanim</em> implants this
        faith in our hearts (<em>Moreh Nevukhim</em> 3:44; <em>Ha-akeida</em>
        §74). The blessing bestowed on us by God is linked to our own efforts,
        or, in kabbalistic terminology, to the "awakening" of the nether worlds
        ("<em>itaruta de-letata</em>"), which in turn causes the awakening of
        the upper realms ("<em>itaruta de-le’eila</em>"). By fulfilling the
        mitzva of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, God’s desire to bestow blessing upon
        Israel is awakened.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        During Temple times, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> would take place after the
        daily sacrificial offerings were completed. The Torah recounts that on
the eighth day of the <em>Mishkan</em>’s dedication, the day that the        <em>kohanim</em> were inaugurated in their service: "Aharon lifted his
        hands toward the people and blessed them. He then descended from [the
        altar where he] had prepared sin offering, burnt offering, and peace
offering" (Vayikra 9:22). It is from here that we derive that        <em>Birkat Kohanim </em>(also called "<em>Nesi’at Kapayim</em>" – "the
        lifting of the hands" – after this verse) took place at the conclusion
        of the sacrificial offerings. The reason for this is that after
        offering the sacrifices, which express our willingness to surrender and
        sacrifice ourselves for God, we are worthy of receiving His blessing.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Outside of the Temple, the Sages ordained that <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>
        is recited at the time of prayer, since prayer corresponds to offerings
        and is designed for the same purpose: coming closer to God. Thus, just
        as <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> takes place after the <em>korbanot</em>, so
too it was instituted toward the end of <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em> of        <em>Shemoneh</em>.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>
        must be recited aloud and in Hebrew. The <em>kohanim </em>must stand
        and lift their hands toward the congregation. A <em>kohen </em>who
        cannot meet these conditions may not perform <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>
        (SA<em> </em>128:14; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 20:4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Before the <em>kohanim</em> lift their hands, they must wash them.
        There is an allusion to this in the verse: "Lift up your hands in
        holiness and bless God" (Tehilim 134:2). Any <em>kohen</em> who did not
        wash his hands may not bless the congregation (<em>Sota</em> 39a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
R. Yoĥanan b. Zakai enacted that <em>kohanim</em> not perform<em>Birkat Kohanim </em>while wearing sandals or shoes (as explained in        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 20:8).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        This is the protocol of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>: The <em>ĥazan</em> or
the <em>gabbai</em> declares "<em>kohanim</em>," but if only one        <em>kohen</em> goes up before the ark, "<em>kohanim</em>" is not
        declared. This is derived from the verse "Say to them" (Bamidbar 6:23),
        which is in the plural and indicates that the word "<em>kohanim</em>"
        is only declared when there are at least two <em>kohanim</em> present
(SA 128:10). <em>Birkat Kohanim </em>is not recited by the        <em>kohanim</em> on their own. Rather, the <em>ĥazan</em> recites each
        word and the <em>kohanim</em> repeat after him. At the completion of
        each verse, the congregation answers "amen."

        in intent silence and respond "amen" also participate in the
        fulfillment of this biblical commandment.

        When the <em>kohanim</em> perform <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, the
        congregation must stand in front of them, as it is written: "This is
        how you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them" (Bamidbar 6:23). The
        Sages interpret this to mean that <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> must be
        performed in the same way that people talk to their friends – by
        standing face to face and speaking aloud so that all those receiving
        the blessing can hear them. Although technically the audience may sit,
        it has become customary that all stand for <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>.
        Still, an ill or weak person who has difficulty standing may sit (MB
        128:51; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:18).

    <p dir="LTR">
        One who cannot come to the synagogue due to matters out of his control
– for instance, one who must go to work – is still included in the        <em>berakha</em>. Similarly, women and children who are not required to
        come to the synagogue are included in the <em>berakha</em>. Only men
who can go to the synagogue but neglect to do so are excluded from the        <em>berakha</em>.

    <p dir="LTR">
        One who comes to the synagogue but stands behind the <em>kohanim</em>

        If he is standing directly alongside them, he must turn toward them to
        be included in the <em>berakha</em>. Those sitting in the first pews of
the synagogue must measure where they are in relation to the        <em>kohanim</em>. If they are in front of them or even directly to the
side of them, they may remain in place and turn toward the<em>kohanim</em>. However, if they are slightly behind the        <em>kohanim</em>, they must move elsewhere for <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>.
        The same ruling applies to women in the women’s section at the sides of

        Anyone standing in the synagogue facing the <em>kohanim</em> is

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The <em>kohanim</em> were commanded to perform <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>,
        but the blessing itself comes from God and does not depend on the
        righteousness of the <em>kohanim</em>. Therefore, even a <em>kohen</em>
        eats forbidden foods, has forbidden sexual relations, or commits other
        sins must perform <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. If he does not perform it,
        he compounds his sin, as Rambam writes: "Do not tell an evil person,
        ‘Do more evil and refrain from performing <em>mitzvot</em>’" (MT, Laws
        of Prayer 15:6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        However, a <em>kohen</em> who has committed sins that mar his priestly
        status, such as marrying a divorcee or becoming contaminated by a
corpse, is penalized by the Sages and forbidden him to perform        <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. Likewise, a <em>kohen</em> who worshipped
        idols or publicly desecrated Shabbat out of spite is deemed ineligible
        to perform <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. However, if the <em>kohanim</em>
        who committed these sins repent completely, they may resume their
        priestly duties and perform the <em>berakha</em> (SA<em> </em>128:37,
        40-41; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 20:10).

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">

away from you… your hands are full of blood" (Yeshayahu 1:15;        <em>Berakhot</em> 32b). The <em>kohen</em>’s job is to increase
kindness and life, like Aharon, who loved and pursued peace. A        <em>kohen</em> who has killed has damaged the core of his priesthood.
        Thus, a <em>kohen</em> who unintentionally ran someone over with his
        car may not perform <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. The <em>poskim</em>
        disagree about whether he may repent by fasting, <em>tzedaka</em>, and
resolving not to sin again would enable him to once again perform        <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. In practice, a <em>kohen</em> who undergoes
        such a terrible experience must go to his rabbi to receive personal

        the study of Torah. The Sages teach that this enactment was instituted
        based on the verse, "They traveled for three days in the desert without
        finding any water" (Shemot 15:22). Moshe and his disciples, the elders
        and the prophets, understood that the thirst for water was a result of
        three consecutive days in which Israel did not engage publicly in Torah
        (BK 82a). Torah is likened to water, for just as water sustains all
        animal and plant life, so too Torah sustains the soul. When the people
        disconnected themselves from the Torah even slightly, water sources
        also ceased to flow. Although the Torah scholars of that generation
        presumably studied Torah during those three days, the meaning here is
        that for three days the people of Israel did not engage in Torah
        publicly. Therefore, it was established that the Torah would be read
        every Monday, Thursday, and Shabbat, so that never again will more than
        three days pass without Israel publicly reading from the Torah.

Ezra the Scribe further instituted that the Torah be read at        <em>Minĥa</em> on Shabbat because of "<em>yoshvei keranot</em>" (BK
        82a). Some say that <em>yoshvei keranot</em> are merchants and
        craftsmen who are unable to hear the reading on Mondays and Thursdays,
        and so the Shabbat <em>Minĥa</em> reading was added as a make-up
        opportunity for them. Others maintain that <em>yoshvei keranot</em> are
frivolous individuals. There was concern that after they finish        <em>Shaĥarit</em> on Shabbat they would turn to drink and idleness, and
so Torah reading was instituted at <em>Minĥa</em> (see        <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Shabbat </em>5:8). The Sages further
        enacted that relevant Torah portions are read on all festivals and Rosh
        Ĥodesh.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        On Mondays and Thursdays three people are called up ("<em>olim</em>")
        to the Torah; four on Rosh Ĥodesh and <em>Ĥol Ha-mo’ed</em>; five on
        Yom Tov; six on Yom Kippur; and seven on Shabbat (<em>Megilla</em>
        21a). Initially, it was customary that each person called up to the
        Torah would read that section, but as time went on, most congregations
        designated a Torah reader (<em>ba’al koreh</em>) who would read the
        Torah for everyone. This is so those who do not know how to read the
        Torah are not insulted and so the reading itself is especially accurate
        (<em>Peninei Halakha: Collected Essays I </em>4:6; <em>II</em> p. 227)
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Technically, it is permissible to add <em>aliyot</em> on Shabbat and
        call up more than seven people to the Torah, as long as each person
        called up for an <em>aliya</em> reads at least three verses. However,
        for several reasons, it is preferable not to add <em>aliyot</em>. Only
        when there is a pressing need, such as for a joyous occasion with
celebrants who will be insulted if they are not called up, may<em>aliyot </em>be added to the standard seven (SA 282:1-2; MB 4-5; see        <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Shabbat </em>5:6).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The reading must be done from a kosher scroll, written with the proper
        intent, in ink, on parchment, just as the first Torah scroll was
        written by Moshe at God’s dictate. The reading must be in the presence
        of a <em>minyan</em>, as it is <em>davar she-bikdusha</em> (see above,
        2:10, which states that women are exempt from Torah reading, and below,
22:4-6, regarding Torah reading on Shabbat. See also        <em> Peninei Halakha: Collected Essays I </em>ch. 4 and <em>Prayer</em>
        ch. 22).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The <em>ĥazan</em> leads the prayer service. At times, the whole
        congregation says the prayers together with him while he sets the pace,
and at other times (such as <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz </em>and        <em>Kaddish</em>), he alone recites the prayers, with the congregation
        responding "amen." The <em>ĥazan</em> must be honest, well-regarded,
        modest, and amiable, have a nice voice, and regularly read from the
        Torah, Prophets, and Holy Scripture (<em>Ta’anit</em> 16a; SA 53:4). We
        are especially strict about this on the Days of Awe and on fast days,
        when we pray to God and beg Him to forgive us for our sins, save us
        from our troubles, and bring our redemption closer. If there is flaw in
        the <em>ĥazan</em>, the congregation’s prayer will not ascend properly
        (Rema 581:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
During the time of the Sages, it was forbidden to write        <em>siddurim</em> because only the written Torah, meaning Tanakh, was
        permitted to be written. Anything that was transmitted orally,
        including the prayers and blessings instituted by the Sages, was
        forbidden to be put into writing (<em>Temura</em> 14b). At that time,
        the <em>ĥazan</em>’s task was very important, because he had to know
        all the prayers by heart and recite them aloud, for the audience
        fulfilled their obligations through him. Therefore, the congregation
        chose a permanent <em>ĥazan</em> for this honorable task, and all the
        particular laws that apply to appointing the <em>ĥazan</em> on fast
        days also pertained to the regular <em>ĥazan</em>. Originally, each and
        every member of the congregation would have to agree to the appointment
        of the <em>ĥazan</em>, since the <em>ĥazan</em> was the one who
        fulfilled the obligation on everyone’s behalf. However, after the
        destruction of the Second Temple, the Sages recognized the necessity of
        permitting the writing of the Oral Torah so that it would not be
        forgotten by the Jewish people. Included in that was the permission to
        write down the prayers. With time, <em>siddurim </em>became
        increasingly common, and today there is no need for the <em>ĥazan</em>
        to fulfill the obligation on the congregation’s behalf because all
        congregants pray with <em>siddurim</em>. Hence, there is less of a need
        to be meticulous in choosing a <em>ĥazan</em>, and it is not customary
        to select a permanent <em>ĥazan</em> for the whole year. Instead, each
        day a different person leads the prayer service (SA 53:19; MB 53:53).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even so, the <em>gabba’im</em>, must try to choose as <em>ĥazanim </em>
        decent people who abide by the Torah and observe the <em>mitzvot. </em>
        They should be people who the congregation agrees to appoint as its
emissaries, for the <em>ĥazanim</em> are the ones who repeat the<em>Amida</em> and recite <em>Kaddish</em> on its behalf (see        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 53:86). Additionally, on Shabbat and festivals,
        when it is customary for <em>ĥazanim</em> to sing and chant part of the
        service, the appointed <em>ĥazanim</em> should be musically gifted with
        pleasant voices.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Ĥazanim</em>
        must have <em>kavana</em> that their singing is the sake of heaven. If
        they prolong their <em>ĥazanut</em> (cantorial virtuosity) with the
        sole purpose of showing off their beautiful voices, the Torah states
        about them, "They have raised their voice against Me, so I hated them"
        (Yirmiyahu 12:8). They are using the holy prayer service to
        self-aggrandize. Even one whose sole intent is for the sake of heaven
        should not prolong his singing, so as not to burden the congregation
        (Rashba; SA 53:11).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Ĥazanim</em>
        may not repeat the words of <em>berakhot</em> and <em>Kaddish </em>
        because doing so changes the formula that the Sages established. If
        repeating the words alters the meaning of the <em>berakha</em>, those
        words are considered a <em>hefsek</em>, and the <em>ĥazan</em> must
        recite the <em>berakha</em> again from the beginning. However, if there
        is no change in the meaning, <em>be-di’avad</em> he does not need to
        recite the <em>berakha </em>again, because he did not interrupt its
recitation with an extraneous matter (see <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 2:22;        <em>Yabi’a Omer </em>6:7).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether one may use melodies of
        profane songs for prayers and liturgy. In practice, when the
        congregation is not familiar with the crude lyrics of the song, it is
        customary to be lenient and fit the melody to the prayer. However, if
        the congregation recognizes the song, one may not use that tune for
        prayer, because when the people sing it, they remember the crude theme
of the song and their <em>kavana</em> is likely to be disrupted (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 4 n. 1). It is forbidden to
appoint a singer who normally sings songs with vulgar content to be        <em>ĥazan</em> (Rema<em> </em>53:25).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is not fitting for one to desire to be <em>ĥazan</em>. Therefore,
        when the <em>gabbai</em> asks someone in the congregation to lead the
        service, proper protocol is do refuse at first, though he should not
        decline excessively (see SA 53:16; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
        4:3). If one is capable of leading the prayers but refuses, he indeed
        insults the honor of the prayer service as well as God’s honor. In
        particular, one who God endowed with a talent for singing and a
        pleasant voice should not decline on Shabbat and festivals, since the
        prayers on those days are rich with song and melody. If he refuses to
        pray out of stubbornness or laziness, and does not praise God with his
voice, it would have been better had he not come into this world (        <em>Sefer Ĥasidim</em> 768). The Sages say about Navot of Jezreel that
        he had an exceptionally pleasant voice and would ascend to the Temple
        in Jerusalem for the three pilgrimage festivals, where all Israel would
        gather to hear him. The one time he stayed home to guard his vineyard,
        he was punished; lawless people testified that he rebelled against the
        king and he was put to death (<em>Pesikta Rabbati</em> §25).

18. The Mourner’s Prayer and the Recitation of the Mourner’s            <em>Kaddish</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who is mourning a parent recites <em>Kaddish</em> during that first
        year after the death, and it helps save the deceased from harsh
        judgment; since the deceased left progeny who sanctify God’s name in
        the world, clearly the deceased’s life was of enduring value. If a son
        knows how to lead the services and the congregation agrees to his
        appointment, it is best for him to be the <em>ĥazan</em> on weekdays,
        since this benefits the deceased even more. It is also customary for
mourners to say <em>Kaddish</em> and lead the prayers on the day of        <em>yahrtzeit</em>. When there are several mourners in the synagogue,
        it is customary that everyone recites <em>Kaddish</em> together.
        Concerning leading the prayer service, there is an order of precedence;
        for example, someone who is in his first thirty days of mourning takes
priority over one who is in his year of mourning (as explained in        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 4:5-7).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        A minor whose mother or father died says <em>Kaddish</em> even though
he is not yet a bar mitzva. It is for this purpose that        <em>Kaddish Yatom </em>was instituted. It is preferable for an adult to
        lead the prayers and thereby benefit the deceased’s soul, but for a
minor who cannot be <em>ĥazan</em>, the Sages instituted        <em>Kaddish</em> (Rema<em> </em>YD<em> </em>376:4). Even if the minor
        has not yet reached the age of education, the <em>Kaddish</em> is
        dictated to him, the young orphan repeats the <em>Kaddish</em> word for
        word, and the congregation answers "amen."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is proper to recite <em>Kaddish</em> on behalf of adoptive parents,
        especially if they do not have another son (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
        7:23:13). A convert should recite <em>Kaddish</em> on behalf of his
        gentile parents (<em>Responsa Zekan Aharon </em>YD 87).

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If one was not privileged to leave behind a son or whose son is not
God-fearing and does not come to the synagogue to recite<em>Kaddish</em> for them, a God-fearing grandson may say        <em>Kaddish</em> for the whole year. A grandson from a son takes
        precedence over a grandson from a daughter. If the deceased does not
have a grandson yet, but has a son-in-law, the son-in-law should say<em>Kaddish</em>. The grandson and son-in-law may recite        <em>Kaddish </em>for their grandparent or parent in-law<em> </em>only
        after receiving permission from their own parents if they are still
living. If the deceased does not have a son-in-law, the father recites        <em>Kaddish</em> for his child. If his father is also dead, a brother
        or nephew says <em>Kaddish</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        When there is no relative to recite <em>Kaddish</em> for the deceased,
        part of the inheritance money should be used to hire a God-fearing
        person to recite <em>Kaddish</em>. It is good to hire someone who is
        engrossed in Torah. If someone in the family who is engrossed in Torah,
he takes precedence over a stranger. Monetary compensation for reciting        <em>Kaddish</em> is important to ensure its recitation. Furthermore, if
        they employ someone who is involved in Torah or a poor person who has
        children to support, the deceased will thereby accrue more merit.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The common ruling nowadays is that a man should be hired to recite        <em>Kaddish </em>even if the deceased left a daughter.

            <em>Megilla </em>
            23b and <em>Sofrim</em> 10:7 mention the things that must be
recited with a <em>minyan</em>. The Sages (            <em>Megilla op. cit. </em>and <em>Berakhot </em>21b) derive from
            the verse "I shall be sanctified among the Israelites" (Vayikra
            22:32) that a <em>davar she-bikidusha</em> shall not be recited
            among less than ten. Ran (<em>ad loc.</em>) and other Rishonim and
            Aĥaronim explain that this is a rabbinic law, since the very
            recitation of these words is of rabbinic origin. Nevertheless, the
            basic idea of <em>minyan</em> comes from Torah law that governs the
            sanctification of God’s name (<em>Kiddush Hashem</em>). That is,
            one is obligated to surrender his life rather than desecrating
            God’s name by performing a transgression under coercion in the
            presence of ten Jews (<em>Sanhedrin </em>74b). It seems that for
this purpose, women count toward the ten (though            <em>Devar Shmuel </em>(Aboab) §63 and <em>Pitĥei Teshuva </em>YD
            157:7 raise doubts about this).

See <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>6:13 and <em>Petaĥ Ha-bayit</em> 24-25            <em>ad loc</em>. Clearly, a woman praying in the women’s section
            accrues the merit of praying in a synagogue. Even those who
            maintain that the sanctity of the women’s section is not the same
            as the sanctity of the synagogue (<em>Ĥokhmat Adam</em> 86:15)
            would presumably agree that during prayer services the sanctity of
            the <em>minyan</em> extends to the women’s section, which is
            subordinate to the synagogue. AHS 154:7 rules that the women’s
            section is just as holy as the synagogue itself, and this is the
opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, as cited in            <em>Tzedaka U-mishpat</em> 12:21.

There are differing customs regarding the response of "            <em>Yehei shemei rabba</em>…" According to Ashkenazic and Yemenite

Sephardim, if one has finished reciting until "            <em>de-amiran be-alma</em>," responds "amen" and otherwise does not
respond. One should pause between "Amen" and "            <em>Yehei shemei rabba</em>," for the "Amen" is a response to what
the <em>ĥazan</em> said previously, and "            <em>Yehei shemei rabba</em>" is a praise in itself (MB 56:2).

According to Ashkenazic custom, one may answer "amen" to            <em>Ha-Kel Ha-kadosh</em> and <em>Shome’a Tefila </em>while
            reciting <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, for they are on a higher
level because they conclude the <em>berakhot</em> of praise and the            <em>berakhot</em> of request. According to Sephardic custom, those
particular <em>berakhot</em> have the same status as other            <em>berakhot</em>, and one does not respond to them. Likewise,
Sephardic custom is that one who finishes one of the            <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> before the <em>ĥazan</em> does not
answer "amen," just as he does not respond "amen<em>" </em>to any            <em>berakha</em>. Ashkenazic custom is to answer because since it
            is one of the <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, responding to it is
            not considered an interruption (MB 59: 24-25; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>

            Although there have been places through the years where, if the
deceased left only daughters, a daughter would recite            <em>Kaddish </em>in her home or in a room adjacent to the

recite <em>Kaddish </em>in the synagogue. However,            <em>Ĥavot Ya’ir </em>§222 states that it is proper to object to the
            recitation of <em>Kaddish </em>by women, so that the power of
            custom is not undermined, and the accepted custom is that daughters
do not recite <em>Kaddish </em>(<em>Yalkut Yosef </em>7:23:11;            <em>Pnei Barukh </em>34:20; <em>Piskei Teshuvot </em>132:33).

            However, where there is demand for this practice, and there is no
            concern that it will undermine customary practice – whether because
            they have already been eroded or because the congregation is
            God-fearing and meticulous about mitzva observance – and there is
            no concern that it will cause dissent, the local rabbi may rule
            that they should recite <em>Kaddish</em> from the women’s section
            and under the conditions he specified. After all, as noted, there
            were places that had this custom in the past.

            This and similar <em>halakhot</em> demonstrate the importance of a
            local or congregational rabbi who is responsible for imbuing it
            with Torah, <em>mitzvot</em>, and their values. It is therefore
            important that every congregation has a designated rabbi who
            understands the congregants intimately. It is also important that
            the congregation rally around him and not instigate disputes when
            he decides in favor of one side or the other.
