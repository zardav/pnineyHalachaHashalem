    Chapter Two: The Laws of Counting the Omer
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>2.1 – The Mitzvah and its Meaning </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Starting from the night of the Omer harvest, there is a mitzvah to count forty-nine days, which are seven weeks. The Omer is harvested on the sixteenth of
    Nissan, which coincides with the night after the first day of Pesach. That night, [our ancestors] would go out [to the fields], cut down stalks of barley,
bring them to the Temple courtyard, thresh them, winnow them, separate out the chaff, toast the grains, grind them well, produce a tenth of an    <em>eifah</em> of flour, sift it in thirteen sifters, mix it with a <em>log</em> [measure] of oil, and place upon it a <em>kometz</em> (around ¾ of a
    handful) of <em>levonah</em> (frankincense). The next day, [part of the mixture] would be offered on the altar. First, a <em>kohen</em> (priest) would wave
    it; and then he would separate a <em>kometz</em> [approximately ¾ of a handful, from the mixture] and burn it on the altar. After the <em>kometz</em> was
    burnt up, everyone was permitted to eat from the new grains.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
It is important to know that the holiday of Shavu’ot does not have a calendar date like the other holidays do. For example, Pesach begins on the 15    <sup>th</sup> of Nissan and Sukkot on the 15<sup>th</sup> of Tishrei. The date on which Shavu’ot falls, however, is determined by the Omer count. The
    holiday arrives after the seven-week count is completed, which is why it is called Shavu’ot – the Festival of Weeks. This is the meaning of the verse:
    <em>
        You shall count for yourself seven weeks; from when the sickle begins [to cut] the standing crop shall you begin to count seven weeks. Then you shall
        observe the Festival of Weeks for the Lord your God
    </em>
    (<em>Devarim</em> 16:9-10). It also says,
    <em>
        You shall count for yourselves from the morrow of the “Sabbath” – from the day you bring the Omer of waving – seven weeks; they shall be complete.
        Until the morrow of the seventh week, you shall count fifty days, and you shall offer a new meal offering to the Lord
    </em>
    (<em>VaYikra</em> 23:15-16).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This mitzvah is not incumbent upon the [Supreme] Rabbinic Court alone; rather, every Jew is commanded to count forty-nine days. And everyone must verbalize
    the <em>sefirah</em> (count) himself. In general, we have a rule when it comes to mitzvot that involve speech: “One who hears is as one who responds.”
    Therefore, for example, one can fulfill the mitzvah of remembering Amalek by hearing the reader [read <em>Parashah Zachor</em>]. Similarly, one can fulfill
his obligation to recite a blessing over the counting of the Omer by hearing the leader’s blessing. With regard to the counting itself, however, several    <em>poskim</em> hold that everyone must enunciate the count himself, as it says, <em>You shall count for yourselves</em> (<em>Levush, Chok Ya’akov</em>).
    True, others hold that the law of <em>sefirah</em> is identical to that of other speech-related mitzvot and one may therefore discharge his obligation by
    hearing someone else’s count (<em>Pri Chadash, Birkei Yosef</em>). Nevertheless, ideally, we try to satisfy all opinions; therefore, everyone must count
    for himself (see <em>M.B.</em> 489:5 and <em>B.H.</em> s.v. <em>u’</em>mitzvah).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The foundation of this mitzvah is rooted in our national inception. <em>Chazal</em> explain that the Children of Israel descended to the forty-ninth level
of impurity during their bondage in Egypt. This made them unworthy of receiving the Torah and necessitated a purification process. Therefore,    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> waited seven weeks to enable them to purify themselves from the defilement of Egypt and reach a state in which they could
receive the Torah (based on <em>Zohar</em>, <em>Emor</em> 97). The <em>sefirah</em> also expresses our anticipation for the giving of the Torah. The    <em>Midrash</em> relates that when Moshe told the Jews that after leaving Egypt they would serve God on Mount Sinai and receive the Torah, they asked,
    “When will this service take place?” Moshe answered, “Fifty days later.” Then, due to their great love [for HaShem], they counted every day and said,
“Behold, one day has passed; two days have passed,” and so on. On account of their love and anticipation for the Torah, it seemed to them as a long time (    <em>Shibolei HaLeket</em> 236).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Thus, <em>Sefirat HaOmer</em> expresses our yearning for that great day, the day on which HaShem gave us the Torah, while we simultaneously undergo a
    process of purification in all the forty-nine levels of which man is comprised. The purer and “cleaner” one is, the more he will be able to absorb the
    Torah’s light. In this way, we prepare ourselves every year for the receiving of the Torah by way of the Omer count (see the end of <em>halachah</em> 3,
    below).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>2.2 – The Process of Ascension from Nationalism to Spirituality </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    By counting the Omer, we draw a line that continuously ascends from Pesach to Shavu’ot. The holiday of Pesach represents Israel’s national side, for the
    Exodus from Egypt revealed Israel’s uniqueness, in that HaShem chose us from among all the other nations, despite the fact that we were sunken in the
    forty-nine levels of impurity. The holiday of Shavu’ot, on the other hand, represents Israel’s spiritual side, for that is when we reached the spiritual
    pinnacle of receiving the Torah. On Pesach, we began the process of liberation from the yoke of Egypt, and on Shavu’ot we completed our freedom from the
    yoke of desire and human perceptions, receiving a heavenly Torah, which makes all those who engage in it truly free (<em>Avot</em> 6:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Another angle: On the holiday of Pesach, the simple, natural faith that is hidden in the soul of every Jew, and remained hidden in the Jewish people’s
    [collective soul] even when they were enslaved in Egypt, comes to the fore. On Shavu’ot, however, we rise to a more developed faith, one that is clarified
    and expanded by virtue of the Torah. Natural faith is very powerful, and it is the foundation of life, but it is not capable of guiding and perfecting
    life. By way of the Torah and its commandments, we are able to link all aspects of our lives – those related to thought, emotions, and actions – to faith.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It comes out, then, that by counting the Omer we gradually elevate ourselves in two ways, ascending from a level of nationalism to that of spirituality and
    from natural faith to a sophisticated faith based on Torah and mitzvot.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is impossible to reach Shavu’ot without Pesach. Once we recognize Israel’s unique nature (<em>segulah</em>), we can rise up [and attain] the Torah. Once
    [we realize that] Israel is the chosen nation, as the Exodus from Egypt demonstrated, we can receive the Torah, as we say in the blessing over the Torah,
    “[Blessed are You, O Lord…] Who has chosen us from all the nations,” and subsequently “has given us His Torah.” Similarly, it is impossible to absorb the
    complex, developed faith that is assimilated in the intellect without first discovering the simple, natural faith. Therefore, it is very important to
    connect the holiday of Pesach to that of Shavu’ot. The counting of the Omer is the link and the ladder that connects these two holidays.

<a name="3"></a><h2>2.3 – The Mechanics of Counting</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Before counting the Omer, one recites the following blessing: “Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with His
    commandments and commanded us regarding the counting of the Omer.” Both the blessing and the counting are said, <em>le’chatchilah</em>, in a standing
    position. If one said them while sitting, he has nonetheless fulfilled his obligation (<em>Sh.A.</em> 489:1).
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are two components to the count – counting the days and counting the weeks, as it says,
    <em>
        You shall count for yourselves from the morrow of the “Sabbath” – from the day you bring the Omer of waving – <strong>seven weeks</strong>; they shall
        be complete. Until the morrow of the seventh week, you shall count <strong>fifty days</strong>
    </em>
    (<em>VaYikra</em> 23:15-16).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, one must mention the tally of days and weeks when counting the Omer (<em>Menachot</em> 61a). For example, on the seventh day, one says, “Today
    is seven days, which are one week, [of the Omer],” and on the fourteenth day, one says, “Today is fourteen days, which are two weeks.” We mention the
    number of days and weeks even in the middle of a week. For example, on the tenth day, we say, “Today is ten days, which are one week and three days.”
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are several versions of the text of the Omer count. Some say, <em>laOmer</em> (“of the Omer”), while others say <em>baOmer</em> (“in the Omer”). Some
    say, “Today is fourteen days of/in the Omer, which are two weeks,” and some say, “Today is fourteen days, which are two weeks, of/in the Omer.” One
    fulfills his obligation no matter which version he uses. The custom is to add the <em>LeSheim Yichud</em> paragraph before counting, as well as various
    other prayers afterwards, but one is not obligated to do so. The main components are the actual counting and the blessing preceding it.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The number seven alludes to a complete phenomenon, for the world was created in seven days. Indeed, every physical entity has six sides – four sides, a
    top, and a bottom – plus a seventh aspect, its inner core. Man, as well, has seven sides, which is why it takes seven days to go from a state of impurity
    to one of purity. For seven days, a person prepares all of his aspects to make this transformation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The same is true of purifying oneself for sacred endeavors in this world, like eating <em>terumah</em> and sacrificial foods, as well as a woman’s
    purification process for her husband. However, in order to absorb God’s Torah, whose lofty stature belongs to the supernal worlds, we need to count much
    deeper – seven weeks instead of seven days. In this count, each one of the seven numbers appears in all of its seven facets. This way, our purification in
    advance of the giving of the Torah is complete. Every aspect of our character undergoes refinement and expresses its yearning and anticipation for the
    receiving of the Torah.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>2.4 – The Status of the Mitzvah after the Temple’s Destruction </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A fundamental question regarding the Omer count is whether the mitzvah is Biblical or Rabbinic ever since the Holy Temple was destroyed. The verse says,
    <em>
        You shall count for yourselves from the morrow of the “Sabbath” – from the day you bring the Omer of waving – seven weeks; they shall be complete.
    </em>
    (<em>VaYikra</em> 23:15).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the Rosh, Ran, and many other <em>Rishonim</em>, the Biblical command to count the Omer is in effect only when we offer the Omer of waving on
    the sixteenth of Nissan, in the Temple. Today, however, when we do not bring this offering, the mitzvah is only Rabbinically ordained. The Rabbis enacted
    it in commemoration of the Omer count that took place when the Temple stood. This is why we are accustomed to praying for the rebuilding of the Temple
    after we finish counting. After all, when the Temple is rebuilt, we will [once again] perform the mitzvah on a Biblical level, and not just as a Rabbinic
    decree.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Rambam and the Ra’avyah believe that the Omer offering is mentioned [in the verse] only to teach us the date on which the Omer count begins. It is not
    a necessary condition [for the fulfillment of the mitzvah]. Therefore, we are commanded from the Torah to count the Omer even today when the Temple is in
    ruins and we are unable to bring the Omer offering.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The practical implication of this <em>halachah</em> concerns situations of doubt. For example, if one counts during the twilight period – that is, between
    sunset and the emergence of [three medium-sized] stars – it is questionable whether he fulfills the mitzvah of counting. If we consider twilight day, he
    does not fulfill his obligation, because the time for tomorrow’s count did not yet arrive. If we consider it night, however, he fulfills his obligation.
    The Aruch HaShulchan (489:2) and the majority of <em>poskim</em> hold that one who counts during twilight fulfills his obligation, because, in their
opinion, the Omer count is a Rabbinic mitzvah nowadays, and we rule leniently when a doubt arises [regarding Rabbinic laws]. However, many    <em>Acharonim</em> write that it is proper to act strictly and recount, without a blessing, after the emergence of the stars, in order to fulfill the
mitzvah even according to those who hold that the Omer count is a Biblical mitzvah nowadays, which requires one to act strictly in cases of doubt (    <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>; <em>M.B.</em> 489:15; <em>B.H.</em> 489:1, s.v. <em>lispor ha’omer</em>).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>2.5 – When to Count</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The Omer count begins on the night of the sixteenth of Nissan, as it says,<em>You shall count for yourself seven weeks; from when the sickle begins [to cut] the standing crop shall you begin to count seven weeks</em> (    <em>Devarim</em> 16:9-10). “<em>From when the sickle begins [to cut] the standing crop</em>” refers to the cutting of the Omer, for the first harvest of
    the yearly produce is designated for the Omer offering. And the Omer is harvested on the night after the first day of Pesach, which is the sixteenth of
    Nissan. That is when the count begins.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must count at night, because the Torah says about the Omer count, <em>Seven weeks; they shall be complete</em> (<em>VaYikra</em> 23:15), meaning whole.
    As is well known, a calendar day consists of night and day, and if we want to include all the nights and days of the seven weeks, we must start counting on
    the night of the sixteenth of Nissan (<em>Menachot</em> 66a). And in order to include all [twenty-four] hours of the day, it is worthy to count at the
    beginning of the night. People are careful about this especially at the beginning of the count, on the first night, so that the count will include every
    hour of the seven weeks. Nonetheless, it is meritorious to count at the beginning of the night every night, so that each day’s count will be whole and will
    include the entire 24-hour period.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though it is best to count at the beginning of the night, one is not obligated to do so. Therefore, one who needs to pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> must do so
before counting the Omer. After all, the rule is that more frequent mitzvot take precedence over less frequent ones, and the mitzvot of reading the<em>Shema</em> and praying <em>Ma’ariv</em> are in practice all year round, making them more frequent than the Omer count (<em>Chok Natan</em>; see    <em>B.H.</em> 489:1, s.v. <em>achar</em>).
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>2.6 – Until When Can One Count? </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who is accustomed to praying <em>Ma’ariv</em> at a late hour all year round, should [nonetheless] count after his regular prayer service. If he counts
    by himself at the beginning of the night, he is liable to make a mistake or forget altogether. Moreover, there is an advantage to doing the mitzvah
    together with a congregation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, one who cannot – due to time constraints – pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> [with a <em>minyan</em>] after the stars emerge, but intends to pray on his own
    later on, should preferably count the Omer right after the stars emerge, in order to fulfill the mitzvah as soon as possible. Furthermore, there is reason
    to suspect that he might forget to count after he prays <em>Ma’ariv</em> by himself.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is a dispute among the <em>Rishonim</em> whether one who forgets to count at night can make it up during the day. The Torah indicates that the time
for counting the Omer depends on the time of the Omer harvest, as it says,    <em>From when the sickle begins [to cut] the standing crop shall you begin to count seven weeks</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 16:9-10). According to the Behag
    (the author of <em>Halachot Gedolot</em>), the <em>halachah</em> follows the opinion cited in Tractate <em>Menachot</em> (71a) that if [the harvester]
    fails to cut down the Omer at night, he may, <em>be’di’avad</em>, cut it down the next day. Subsequently, the same is true of the Omer count: if one
    forgets to count at night, he may, <em>be’di’avad</em>, count the next day. Rabbeinu Tam, however, holds that the <em>halachah</em> follows the opinion
    stated in Tractate <em>Megillah</em> (20b, 21a) that the mitzvah of harvesting the Omer applies at night alone. Therefore, one who forgets to count at
    night cannot make it up the next day. In practice, the accepted halachah is that one who forgets to count at night should count during the day without a
    blessing. On the one hand, we give credence to the opinion that says that one may count during the day. But we omit the blessing, in order not to possibly
    say a blessing in vain (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 489:7). Each subsequent night, he may count with a blessing (<em>Terumat HaDeshen</em>, <em>M.B.</em>
    489:34).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>2.7 – One Who forgets to Count an Entire Day </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The <em>Rishonim</em> debate [the nature of] the Omer count. According to the Behag, it is one long mitzvah stretching from Pesach to Shavu’ot, as it says,    <em>Seven weeks; they shall be complete</em> (<em>VaYikra</em> 23:15). Therefore, one who forgets to count one day forfeits the mitzvah and may not count
    thereafter. However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that each night’s count is a separate mitzvah. Hence, one who forgets to count one day loses that day’s
    mitzvah alone, and he must continue counting the next day, with a blessing (Tosafot, Rosh, Ritva, and more).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, the halachic authorities have determined that even if one forgets to count an entire day, he must continue counting thereafter, in accordance
    with the majority opinion (that each day stands alone). However, he counts without a blessing, in deference to the opinion that holds that the entire count
    is one mitzvah (and when he misses a day, he forfeits the mitzvah). Thus, in order not to, possibly, recite a blessing in vain, he counts each subsequent
    day without a blessing (<em>Sh.A.</em> 489:8).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    And in order not to forfeit the blessing, one who misses a day must have in mind to fulfill his obligation by way of hearing the cantor’s blessing.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This <em>halachah</em> demonstrates the tension that accompanies the Omer count. After all, one who skips a day breaks, to a certain degree, the chain that
    connects the holiday of Pesach to that of Shavu’ot, and forfeits the blessing. It is very important to connect Pesach, which represents holy Jewish
    nationalism, with Shavu’ot, the day we received the Torah, for Torah cannot exist without the Jewish people and the Jewish people cannot exist without
    Torah.
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>2.8 – When in Doubt, Continue Counting with a Blessing </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who is unsure whether he neglected to count one day may continue counting with a blessing, because we worry about the opinion that says that one cannot
    continue counting with a blessing only when one is certain that he missed a day.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, one who forgets to count at night but remembers and counts during the course of the day counts with a blessing on all subsequent nights. Even
though there are those who hold that one does not discharge one’s obligation by counting during the day, [we follow] those who maintain that,    <em>be’di’avad</em>, one who counts during the day fulfills the mitzvah.

<p dir="LTR">
    The law of a young boy who becomes bar mitzvah in the middle of the <em>sefirah</em> period is questionable. Some <em>poskim</em> hold that even if the boy
    is careful to count every day, he cannot continue counting with a blessing, because the days he counted before becoming bar mitzvah are not considered one
    continuum with the days he will count after reaching adulthood. According to most <em>poskim</em>, however, if the boy is careful to count every day before
    his bar mitzvah, his counting is considered complete and he may continue counting with a blessing. This is the prevalent custom.

</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A gentile who converts to Judaism during the <em>sefirah</em> period counts without a blessing, because he did not count at all before his conversion.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>2.9 – Women and the Omer Count</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Based on the famous rule that women are exempt from all time-bound mitzvot, women are exempt from the mitzvah of counting the Omer, for it is dependant on
    time (see <em>Peninei Halachah, Tefillat Nashim</em>, chap. 3, for the logic behind this rule).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
However, a woman who so desires may perform time-bound mitzvot, and she receives credit for doing so. We thus find that women are accustomed to hearing the    <em>shofar</em> on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> and taking a <em>lulav</em> and sitting in a <em>sukkah</em> [on <em>Sukkot</em>]. But the <em>poskim</em> debate
    the issue of the blessing. According to the author of <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 589:6), women do not make blessings over such mitzvot, and
    this is the prevalent custom among most Sefardic women.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The Ashkenazi custom follows the Rama’s opinion, that women who perform time-bound mitzvot are permitted to recite the blessing (see    <em>Tefillat Nashim</em> 2:8). However, some Ashkenazi <em>poskim</em> rule that women should not recite a blessing over the Omer count because they do not
    pray [<em>Ma’ariv</em>] in the synagogue and are therefore more likely to miss a day. As we learned above, one who forgets to count a day is not allowed to
continue counting with a blessing, and perhaps a particular woman will not realize that she forgot to count and will continue counting with a blessing (    <em>M.B.</em> 489:3). Others say that women shouldn’t count the Omer for kabbalistic reasons (<em>Rav Poalim</em>, part 1, end of 10, 12). On the other
    hand, still others claim that the Askenazi custom is for women to count (<em>M.A.</em> 489:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, a woman who knows that she can make it through the entire count, and even if she misses a day, she knows to continue counting without a
    blessing, may count with a blessing, according to Ashkenazi practice. This is especially true regarding a woman who prays <em>Ma’ariv</em> every evening or
    whose family members are in the habit of reminding her to count. She may count with a blessing, if she is Ashkenazi and so desires, because the chances of
    her forgetting to count are relatively small.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>2.10 – Specific Laws Regarding the Mitzvah of Counting</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    If someone asks his friend, at a time when it is permissible to count, “What is today’s Omer count?” the friend should not answer, “Today is day
    such-and-such in the Omer,” unless he has already counted with a blessing. After all, if he says this, he will already fulfill his obligation to count and
    will be unable to recite a blessing over that day’s count. Rather, one should answer, “Yesterday was day such-and-such in the Omer” (<em>Sh.A.</em> 489:4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If one tells his friend which day it is in the Omer while having specific intent not to fulfill his obligation, he may count later on with a blessing. If
    the day’s count is made up of both days and weeks [i.e., after day six] and one tells his friend the number of days [without mentioning the weeks], he may
    count later on, <em>be’di’avad</em>, with a blessing. Since he did not count in the normal fashion, mentioning both the days and the weeks, he has made it
    clear that he did not intend on discharging his obligation of the mitzvah with this response (<em>M.B.</em> 489:22).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Before reciting the blessing, one should remind himself mentally what day it is in the Omer (see <em>Sh.A.</em> 489:6, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 37). If
    someone in unsure whether today is day nine or ten [for example], and there is no one available to ask, he should say both numbers, and thus fulfill his
    obligation either way. However, the <em>poskim</em> debate whether or not to recite the blessing [in such a case]. Some say that one may recite a blessing
    only over a clear and definite count. Others maintain that one may recite a blessing over a doubtful count, because the person knows for sure that one of
    the numbers is correct (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 489:17). In practice, the blessing should be omitted since there is a doubt regarding the matter.

            This idea is alluded to in the fact that we are commanded to count “<em>from the day you bring the Omer of waving</em>” (<em>VaYikra</em> 23:15).
            The Omer is a unique offering made from barley, which is animal food. This represents the physical-national side of Israel. Before we receive the
            Torah and attain knowledge of the Divine, we are like animals, which have no intellect. When we finish counting fifty days and are privileged to
receive the Torah and reach a lofty spiritual state, then, <em>You shall offer a new meal-offering to the Lord</em> (ibid. 23:16). Similarly,            <em>matzah</em> is bread of affliction, and the Zohar teaches that it is bread of faith, that is, natural faith. The new meal-offering brought on
            Shavu’ot is made of leavened wheat; it is rich and developed, alluding to the complete revelation of faith in every aspect of this world. On
            Pesach, the revelation of natural faith occurs through limitation – the restriction against leavened bread. On Shavu’ot, however, it occurs through
            expansion (see [Rav Kook’s] <em>Orot Yisrael</em> 8:1).

            Perhaps it is possible to say that this is the basis of the dispute whether counting the Omer today is a Biblical or Rabbinic mitzvah (below, 2:4).
            If the purpose of the count is to raise ourselves from simple faith to intellectual faith, by way of Torah study, then it is Biblically ordained
            even today. But if [the purpose is] to elevate us from a revelation of faith by way of limitation and abstinence, which expresses itself in the
            prohibition of leavened bread (see <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Pesach</em> 1:5-6), to a level of faith that reveals itself in all areas of life,
            in the physical world with all its pleasures, then the matter depends on [the existence of] the Holy Temple, which connects heaven and earth.
            Therefore, as long as we are unable to offer the Omer, which represents the material forces and which enables us to rise to [the level needed to]
            offer the Two Loaves [on Shavu’ot], we cannot completely reveal faith in all areas of life. Therefore, the counting is only Rabbinically mandated.

The <em>Rishonim</em> find a support for this in the verse <em>From when the sickle begins [to cut] the standing crop </em>(בקמה)<em>shall you begin to count seven weeks</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 16:9) – do not read בקמה, rather בקימה (while standing). The author of            <em>Sefer HaEshkol</em> (<em>Hilchot Pesach</em> 159:1) writes that we do not recite the <em>Shehechiyanu</em> blessing on the Omer count because
            [we count] in anticipation of the holiday of <em>Shavu’ot</em>, and the <em>Shehechiyanu</em> recited on Shavu’ot covers the count as well. The
            Maharil suggests that it is because the Omer count is [only] a preliminary mitzvah, which culminates on Shavu’ot. The Radvaz (4:256), Maharsham
            (1:213), and Rav Poalim (3, <em>O.C.</em> 32) offer these reasons, as well. The Maharil adds that we are worried that one may forget to count one
day and forfeit the entire count. How, then, can [such a person] recite the <em>Shehechiyanu</em> blessing at the beginning? The author of<em>Kol Bo</em> (145) explains that [we omit the blessing] because the mitzvah is [only] Rabbinic nowadays. The Rashba writes in his            <em>Responsa</em> (1:126) that [<em>Shehechiyanu</em> is recited only if the mitzvah gives one pleasure]. The <em>lulav</em> is taken [to express]
            joy; the <em>shofar</em> is [blown] as a remembrance; but the Omer count is merely a preparatory act, which provides no pleasure. Furthermore, we
            perform it today in mournful commemoration of the Temple’s destruction. Rabbeinu Yerucham gives the same reason, quoting the Razah.

            At the completion of every week, one is obligated to mention the number of days and weeks, e.g., “Today is seven days, which are one week.” [There
            is a dispute,] however, regarding the middle of a week, like the eighth day. According to the Razah and other <em>Rishonim</em>, one must count
            only the days and say, “Today is eight days.” Rabbi Efrayim holds that one must count only the weeks and say, “Today is one week and one day.”
            According to the Rif, Rambam, and Rosh, one enumerates both counts every day, and that is our custom, as the Shulchan Aruch writes (489:1).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            If, at the end of a week, one forgets to count the days, he does not discharge his obligation, even <em>be’di’avad</em>, and he must re-count with
            a blessing. And if he fails to rectify his mistake that day, he must count without a blessing from then on. If, at the end of a week, one forgets
            to count the weeks, some say he fulfills his obligation, <em>be’di’avad</em>, while others say he does not. In the middle of a week, however, like
            the eighth day, if one says merely, “Today is eight days,” he fulfills his obligation, <em>be’di’avad</em>. And if he says, “Today is one week and
            one day,” some maintain that he fulfills his obligation. In all of these scenarios, one should re-count properly without a blessing, but if he
failed to do so that day, he counts the next day with a blessing (based on <em>M.B.</em> 489:7, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 9, 19, and            <em>halachah</em> 2.8, below).

            It seems that the Rambam and the Ran hold that it makes no difference when one counts at night. However, our Sages say regarding all mitzvot, “The
            zealous do mitzvot promptly.” According to Tosafot and the Rosh, it is better to count at the beginning of the night, because then the count is
            more complete. The Shulchan Aruch (489:1) rules that one should count at the beginning of the night. The Mishnah Berurah (2) and Kaf HaChayim (12)
            agree. Nevertheless, we pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> first, because the mitzvot of reading the <em>Shema</em> and praying <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> are more
            frequent (<em>Chok Ya’akov</em>). However, the author of <em>Mor U’Ketzi’ah</em> holds that one should count first, because the time for counting
            is at the very beginning of the night, while <em>Shema</em> and <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> can be delayed, <em>le’chatchilah</em>, for a half-hour. In
            practice, we count after the <em>Ma’ariv</em> prayers (<em>B.H.</em> 489:1), because counting at the beginning of the night is not an obligation,
just an embellishment, for as long as one counts at night, he fulfills “<em>They shall be complete</em>.” Therefore, we give precedence to            <em>Shema</em> and <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, which are more frequent.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In order to avoid delaying the count, many [<em>poskim</em>] suggest that we count immediately after the “<em>Titkabel</em>” <em>Kaddish</em>, with
which we end the <em>Amidah</em> (standing prayer), before <em>Aleinu</em>, which is an additional prayer. This is found in the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (489:2) and <em>Nahar Mitzrayim</em>, and most Jews follow this custom, including all Ashkenazim and most Jews who come
            from North Africa. Nonetheless, many Jews who pray according to the Sefardic version of prayer count after <em>Aleinu</em>, in order to first
            finish everything that is usually said in the <em>Ma’ariv</em> service.

            If one is accustomed to praying later, with a <em>minyan</em>, there is reason to suspect that he might sometimes forget to count on his own [at
            the beginning of the night], and when the congregation counts, he will think that he already counted and will, thus, miss a day. There is also
            concern that he will forget that he already counted and will, therefore, count again, reciting a blessing for no reason. Furthermore, there is
merit in counting with a <em>minyan</em>, as the Shelah writes. See also <em>Iggrot Moshe</em>, O.C. 4:99; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 2; and            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 3:3.

            There is no reason to elaborate on the issue of eating before counting the Omer, because it is, anyway, forbidden to eat before praying. Therefore,
            if it is permissible to eat before prayers – when there is something to remind him, as I explain in <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em>
            25:9 – it is also permissible to eat before counting the Omer.

            Further elaboration on this topic: According to the Behag, one who forgets to count a day forfeits the mitzvah, because his count lacks
            completeness. Rav Sa’adya Gaon holds that only one who forgets to count the first day forfeits the mitzvah, while one who skips any other day may
            continue counting with a blessing. Tosafot (<em>Menachot</em> 66a) write that the Behag’s opinion is puzzling, [stating] instead that every day is
            a separate mitzvah. This is also the opinion of the Ri, Rosh, Ritva, and others. The Tur writes that Rav Hai Gaon also agrees. In addition, R.
            Yitzchak (“Ritz”) Giat writes in the name of Rav Hai Gaon that one who misses a day should count the appropriate number the next day and then make
            up for the missed count by saying, “And yesterday was so-and-so.” In practice, we take the Behag’s opinion into account. Therefore, one who forgets
            to count a day continues counting without a blessing; so writes the Shulchan Aruch (489:8). However, some <em>Acharonim</em> rule like the majority
of <em>Geonim</em> and <em>Rishonim</em> that one who forgets can continue counting with a blessing. This is found in            <em>She’arim Metzuyanim BeHalachah</em> 120:7. Still, as mentioned above, most <em>Acharonim</em> hold that one should continue counting without a
            blessing.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            One could ask: why do we say a blessing every day according to the Behag? We are forced to say that even he admits that each day constitutes a
separate mitzvah. It’s just that skipping a day mars the completeness of the count, making it impossible to continue counting. The Chida writes (            <em>Avodat HaKodesh</em> 7:217) that one who knows [in advance] that he will miss a day – due to some uncontrollable circumstance – should omit the
            blessing from the start, because, according to the Behag, all of his blessings will be in vain. Most <em>poskim</em>, however, rule that he should
            count with a blessing until that day, because even the Behag (with whom the vast majority of <em>Rishonim</em> disagree) holds that the blessings
            made prior to the omission are not in vain (<em>Kin’at Sofrim, Rav Poalim</em> <em>O.C.</em> 3:32). This cannot be compared to a <em>zavah</em>’s
            count, about which Tosafot explain that no blessing is recited because if her count is nullified [by seeing new blood] the entire count is
            invalidated. [The difference being] that even if one forgets to count a day, the count continues and Shavu’ot arrives on the fiftieth day.
            Therefore, all the days that he counted without interruption were counted properly and the blessings [were warranted]. Only after missing a day,
            when the person himself will no longer count successively, does the Behag hold that [the blessing should be omitted because] the count is not
            “complete.” See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 489:22.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            One who forgot to count a day and needs to lead the prayers (because he has a <em>yahrtzeit</em>, for example) should ask someone else to recite
            the blessing and count [out loud], even though this will cause him discomfort [seeing that everyone will realize that he missed a day]. Others
            claim that in order to avoid embarrassment, one may rely on the majority of <em>poskim</em> who maintain that even one who forgets a day is
            obligated to count and may [even] recite the blessing on behalf of others. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 489:20.

            The Terumat HaDeshen (1:37) writes that even though we customarily follow the Behag’s opinion, that is true only when one is certain that he forgot
            to count. In a case of doubt, however, we follow the viewpoint of the majority of <em>poskim</em>. His reasoning: Some authorities hold that
            counting the Omer is a Biblical obligation. Therefore, when a doubt arises, one must act stringently, continue to count, and subsequently recite
            the blessing. (The Terumat HaDeshen adds another rationale: saying a blessing in vain is [only] a Rabbinic prohibition. However, even the Shulchan
            Aruch, who [in <em>O.C.</em> 215:4] leans towards the opinion that holds that reciting a blessing in vain is forbidden by the Torah, rules [here,
            in 489:8] in accordance with the Terumat HaDeshen’s opinion.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to most <em>poskim</em>, even if one remembers to count only during the twilight period of the day, he may count the following nights
            with a blessing. There are two reasons to doubt that one has fulfilled his obligation in such a case: Some authorities hold that counting during
            the day is invalid. And even if we say that one discharges his obligation by counting during the day, it is uncertain whether twilight is part of
the day or the beginning of the next night. Nevertheless, since it is not definite that the person missed a day, he can rely on the majority of            <em>poskim</em> who hold that each day is a separate mitzvah and continue counting with a blessing. Furthermore, according to Rabbeinu Tam, our
            definition of twilight is definitely daytime, and the Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 261:2) codifies this as <em>halachah</em>. Now, even though we do not
            follow this ruling, we may use it in a case of doubt in order to rule leniently. There are those who rule strictly, such as <em>K.H.C.</em> 489:83,
but as we stated above, most <em>poskim</em> hold that [one who counts during twilight] may continue counting with a blessing. This is found in            <em>Sho’el U’Meishiv</em>, <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (vol. 4, <em>O.C.</em> 43), and <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 6:7.

            The authors of <em>Birkei Yosef</em>, <em>Chiddushei HaRim</em>, <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (3:28), and others write that the boy cannot continue
            counting with a blessing after his bar mitzvah. However, most <em>poskim</em> – including <em>Ketav Sofer</em> (99), <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>
            (489:15), <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> (94), <em>Har Tzvi</em> (vol. 2, 76), and <em>Or LeTziyon</em> (vol. 1, 95) – hold that he may continue counting
with a blessing, and this is the prevalent custom. They give several reasons for this: Since [the Rabbis] obligate a young boy to count for            <em>chinuch</em> purposes [i.e., in order to educate him in the performance of mitzvot], his previous counting is significant [and can join with]
            his post-bar-mitzvah counting. Moreover, even after his bar mitzvah, he will be obligated to count, at the very least, from a <em>chinuch</em>
            standpoint. Furthermore, since he passed the age of twelve, he is considered “<em>mufla samuch l’ish</em>” (a youngster close to adulthood who
            knows to Whom he takes an oath), whose oaths are Biblically binding. And since he accustomed himself to counting the Omer, it is as if he took an
            oath [to count], and he is thereby obligated to do so by Torah law. Regarding the “completeness” of the count: since he actually counted, why
            shouldn’t it be considered complete, even though he wasn’t originally obligated to the same degree that he is now? And even if it is unclear
            whether his counting as a minor is significant enough, we already learned that whenever there is a doubt, one may continue counting with a
            blessing. See <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 2:8.
