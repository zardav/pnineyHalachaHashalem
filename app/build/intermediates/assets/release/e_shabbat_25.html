        1. Asking a Non-Jew to Do <em>Melakha</em> on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Shabbat belongs to Jews alone, as the Torah states: "For it is a sign
        between Me and you throughout the ages, that you may know that I the
        Lord have consecrated you" (Shemot 31:13). In addition, the Sages go so
        far as to say that "A non-Jew who observes Shabbat is liable for the
        death penalty" (<em>San</em>. 58b). In other words, if a non-Jew were
        to invent his own religion and establish a "Shabbat" for himself,
        during which he would refrain from engaging in <em>melakha</em> and in
        developing the world, he would be liable for death at the hands of
        heaven (see Rashi <em>ad loc.</em> and MT, Laws of Kings 10:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        Although a non-Jew may do <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat, the Sages
        forbade a Jew to ask a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> for him on
        Shabbat. This includes even rabbinically prohibited activities. The
Sages found support for this from the wording of the verse: "No        <em>melakha</em> shall be done on them" (Shemot 12:16). The verse does
        not use the active "Do not do <em>melakha</em>," but rather the passive
        "No <em>melakha </em>shall be done." Thus we see that it is proper that
        no <em>melakha</em> is done for a Jew on Shabbat or Yom Tov. As the
        Midrash elaborates: "‘No <em>melakha </em>shall be done’ - neither by
you, nor by your friend, nor by a non-Jew" (<em>Mekhilta</em>        <em>ad loc.</em>).
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <em>melakha </em>will be done with a Jew’s property, one may not
        ask a non-Jew to do a <em>melakha</em> even for the non-Jew’s benefit.
        For example, one may not tell a visiting non-Jew: "Turn on the light
        for yourself." Similarly, one may not say to a non-Jew: "Cook my food
        for yourself." However, if the meat belongs to the non-Jew, one may
tell him to cook it for himself. Since the non-Jew is performing the        <em>melakha</em> with his own possessions for his own benefit, the
        Sages did not forbid such speech (SA 307:21; MB <em>ad loc. </em>73).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages decreed that a Jew may not benefit from a <em>melakha</em>
        performed by a non-Jew for the Jew’s benefit. For example, if the
        lights in one’s home went out, and a non-Jewish neighbor came and
        turned the lights on, neither the Jews living in that home nor any
        other Jews may benefit from these lights, since they were turned on for
        a Jew on Shabbat (SA 276:1). If the <em>melakha</em> undertaken by the
        non-Jew is time-consuming, a Jew may not benefit from it immediately
        after Shabbat either. Rather, he must wait until enough time has passed
        so that the <em>melakha</em> could have been done after Shabbat. For
        example, if a non-Jew picked fruit or fished for a Jew on Shabbat, the
        fruit or fish may not be eaten after Shabbat until enough time has
        passed that they could have been picked or caught then (SA 325:5-6).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <em>melakha</em> performed by the non-Jew for the Jew is only
prohibited rabbinically, then only the Jew for whom the        <em>melakha</em> was performed may not benefit from it on Shabbat.
        Other Jews may benefit from the <em>melakha </em>even on Shabbat. Once
Shabbat is over and enough time has passed so that the <em>melakha</em><em> </em>could have been done after Shabbat, even the Jew for whom the<em>melakha </em>was performed may benefit from it (SA 325:8; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 41).
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. Benefiting from a <em>Melakha</em> That a Non-Jew Performed for
        Himself
    </h2>
    <p>
        The prohibition on benefiting from a <em>melakha</em> done by a non-Jew
on Shabbat is limited to a case where the non-Jew undertook the<em>melakha</em> for the benefit of a Jew. However, if he did the        <em>melakha</em> for himself or for another non-Jew, then a Jew may
        benefit from it. For example, if a non-Jew turned on a light because he
        wanted to read a book, a Jew may benefit from this light (SA 276:2).
        Moreover, even if the non-Jew intended to turn on the light for both
        himself and a Jew, the Jew may benefit from it since in any case the
        non-Jew needed to turn on the light for himself (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em>;
        AHS 276:8; BHL 276:2 s.v. "ve-im" is inclined this way as well, in
        contrast to MA).
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if the lights went out in a Jew’s home, he may not ask a
        non-Jewish neighbor to turn on the light, but he may arrange things so
        that the non-Jew will turn on the light for himself, after which the
        Jew may benefit from the light. For example, he can invite the non-Jew
        to come over and eat something. When the non-Jew arrives and sees that
        the house is dark, he will realize that he should turn on the light.
        Since the non-Jew is turning the light on for himself, so that he can
        see the food that is being served, the Jew may benefit from the light
        as well (AHS<em> </em>276:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if a Jew has non-Jewish household help, one may send him to
        wash dishes in the kitchen even if it is dark there. Upon entering the
        kitchen, the non-Jew will turn on the light for himself, after which
        the Jew may benefit from the light. The Jew may even request that the
        non-Jew leave the light on after finishing his work (MB 276:27; SSK
        30:57). However, if a Jew needs to walk somewhere in the dark, he may
        not ask his non-Jewish domestic worker to come along so that he will
        turn on a flashlight for himself. In this case, it is clear that the
        non-Jew is actually doing the <em>melakha</em> for the Jew (SA 276:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a non-Jew heated water for himself on Shabbat and some extra water
        remained, a Jew may not use it, since the non-Jew may have heated the
        extra water with him in mind. Even if this was not the case, if the
        non-Jew sees the Jew using the remaining water, he may decide to add
        extra water for the Jew on future occasions. However, if the non-Jew
        does not know the Jew, then the Jew may use the extra water, because
        there is no concern that the non-Jew added the water for him or will
        add water for him in the future (SA 325:11; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 66). If
        a non-Jew picked fruit, caught fish, or milked cows on Shabbat for his
        own use, a Jew may not eat or drink the products on Shabbat, even if
        the non-Jew is a stranger. Since these food items were not edible when
        Shabbat began, they are <em>muktzeh</em> (SA 325:5).

        3. Making Use of a <em>Melakha</em> Performed on Shabbat for a Jew
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a Jewish home was dimly lit - enough to allow the household members
        to eat, clean up, and wash the dishes, but not enough to allow them to
        read - and a non-Jew came and turned on an additional light for them, a
        Jew may use its light to eat, clean up, and wash the dishes, but not
        read. They may only do what they could have done without the additional
        light, but activities that were impossible to do without the additional
        light may not be done (SA 276:4; MB <em>ad loc. </em>32).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a non-Jew turned off a light to help a Jew sleep, the Jew may sleep
        in that room. Even though the non-Jew turned off the light on his
        behalf, and had he not done so the Jew would not have been able to
        sleep, the Jew is not benefiting from anything substantive created by
        the non-Jew’s <em>melakha</em> but from the absence of light.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though a Jew may benefit in the above situations from the light or
        darkness that a non-Jew contributed to a room, a Jew may not ask a
        non-Jew to turn the lights on or off. However, he may hint at such a
        request. He must be careful with his formulation, though. It may not
        include anything that might be taken as a command. For example, if
        there is not enough light, one may not say to a non-Jew: "Do me a favor
        - there is not enough light in the room." Pointing to the light is also
forbidden, because this is considered a hint that resembles a command (        <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 62:2). Similarly, if the light is on and is keeping
        one from sleeping, he may not say to a non-Jew: "Do what needs to be
        done" or "Do me a favor - I cannot sleep here," nor may he point to the
        light.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, one may hint by way of description. Thus if one needs more
        light, he may say to a non-Jew: "It is difficult for me to clean the
        house or to read when the light is so dim," or "The house is not well
        lit because only one light is on." These descriptions do not comprise a
        request that the non-Jew act; he is simply reporting the facts. The
        non-Jew then decides on his own to help the Jew by turning on an
        additional light. Similarly, if light is keeping a Jew from sleeping,
        he may say: "It is hard for me to sleep with the light on." The non-Jew
        will then figure out on his own that if he wants to help the Jew, he
        should turn off the light.
    </p>
    <p>
        If no toilet paper was cut before Shabbat, this also may be reported to
        a non-Jew in descriptive form: "I have no toilet paper." The non-Jew
        will then cut toilet paper for him. This is not considered benefiting
        from a <em>melakha</em> that a non-Jew performed, because it is
        possible in a pinch to use toilet paper even when it has not been cut.
        However, he may not formulate his statement as a command, such as "Do
        me a favor - I have no toilet paper." Similarly, if the oven was left
        on accidentally, one may say to a non-Jew: "What a shame that so much
        electricity is being wasted." The non-Jew will understand the hint on
        his own and turn it off. However, one may not include a command in the
        hint, such as: "Whoever turns it off will not lose [i.e., will be
        rewarded]."

    </p>
    <p>
        In short, one may benefit from the actions of a non-Jew on Shabbat as
        long as he is careful to avoid two rabbinic prohibitions. First, he may
        not tell the non-Jew to perform a <em>melakha</em>, but must hint at it
by reporting the facts. Second, one may not benefit from        <em>melakha</em> performed by a non-Jew if it makes it possible for him
        to do something that he could not have done otherwise. Thus one may
        hint one’s request to a non-Jew by means of a description, and one may
        benefit from light that a non-Jew added where there was already enough
        light to manage in a pinch. In addition, one may benefit from a
        non-Jew’s act of turning off a light or an oven, since this does not
        involve direct benefit from the <em>melakha</em> he performed.

        All the methods presented here are permitted <em>le-khatĥila</em>. When
        none of these methods are sufficient, then for a great need or for the
        sake of a mitzva, the Sages permitted asking a non-Jew to perform a
        rabbinically forbidden <em>melakha</em>. Sometimes one may even ask him
        to perform a <em>melakha</em> that is prohibited by Torah law, as will
        be explained in the upcoming sections.
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. For the Sake of a Mitzva or for a Great Need
    </h2>
    <p>
The Sages permitted asking a non-Jew to do a rabbinically forbidden        <em>melakha</em> in cases of great need, such as to prevent suffering
or loss, or for the sake of a mitzva. Such cases are a <em>shvut</em>        <em>di-shvut</em>, a combination of two rabbinic prohibitions: the
        action itself is prohibited rabbinically, and the entire prohibition of
        asking a non-Jew to perform <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat is rabbinic.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, one may not ask a non-Jew to perform a <em>melakha</em>
        that is prohibited by Torah law, even for the sake of a mitzva. One may
        do so only for the sake of settling Eretz Yisrael or when there is a
pressing communal mitzva need. Additionally, if not doing the        <em>melakha</em> would entail suffering a very large financial loss,
        the Sages permit asking a non-Jew to do it. This is because they were
        afraid that if they were to prohibit this, the person suffering the
        loss would end up desecrating Shabbat himself on account of his great
        anguish. These laws are detailed above (9:11-12; 16:5 and n. 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us illustrate this principle. One may ask a non-Jew to remove a
        shofar from a tree in order to use it on Rosh Ha-shana, since the
        prohibition of using a tree is rabbinic (SA 307:7; above, 19:7).
Similarly, one may ask a non-Jew to bring wine for <em>kiddush</em> or        <em>siddurim</em> for the synagogue through a <em>karmelit</em>, as
        carrying there is rabbinically prohibited (MB 325:60; 21:3 above). One
        may also ask a non-Jew to bring food that is essential to the Shabbat
        meals through a <em>karmelit</em>, as this food enables people to
        fulfill the mitzva of <em>oneg Shabbat</em>. However, one may not ask a
        non-Jew to carry food that is not essential to the meal (MB 325:62).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may ask a non-Jew to move <em>muktzeh</em> items in order to
        prevent a loss. For example, one may ask a non-Jew to collect scattered
        money, so that it will not get lost or stolen. One may also ask a
        non-Jew to bring bags of cement from the yard into the house so that
        they are not ruined in the rain (SA 307:19; see MB <em>ad loc.</em>
        69).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a door is squeaking so loudly that it is difficult to sleep, one may
        ask a non-Jew to oil the hinges. The relevant prohibition is rabbinic,
since the door can be used even if the hinges are not oiled (        <em>Melakhim Omnayikh</em> 6:1 and n. 1). Additionally, if mosquitoes
        are buzzing around in a room and disturbing one’s sleep, one may ask a
        non-Jew to spray and kill them. Since mosquitoes are not being killed
        to use their bodies, the prohibition is rabbinic (20:8 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is uncertain whether a particular action is prohibited
        rabbinically or by Torah law, one may ask a non-Jew to undertake the
        action for the sake of a mitzva or a great need. The prohibition of
        asking a non-Jew to perform <em>melakha</em> is rabbinic, and in
        general when there is uncertainty pertaining to a rabbinic rule, we are
        lenient.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the lights went out in a synagogue or in a <em>beit midrash</em>,
        one may ask a non-Jew to turn them on using a <em>shinui</em>, since
        doing so is only prohibited rabbinically. If using a <em>shinui</em> is
        not feasible, as long as there is a pressing need that relates to a
        communal mitzva, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on the light even
        without a <em>shinui</em>. If possible, it is preferable to give him
        something to eat there, so that he will be turning the light on for
        himself, which is permissible even if it is not for the sake of a
        mitzva.

        5. A Non-Jew’s <em>Melakha </em>for Someone Sick or Suffering (and Air
        Conditioners)
    </h2>
    <p>
Under normal circumstances, one may not ask a non-Jew to perform        <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat. However, for the sake of a sick person,
        one may ask a non-Jew to perform <em>melakhot</em>, even those that are
        prohibited by Torah law. These leniencies apply even to one who is not
        dangerously ill. If one is dangerously ill, then even a Jew must
        desecrate Shabbat in order to help him, as saving a life overrides
        Shabbat (SA 328:17). The laws pertaining to sick people will be
        explained below in chapters 27 and 28.
    </p>
    <p>
        A child who needs something very badly has the same status as a sick
        person, and one may ask a non-Jew to do even <em>melakhot</em> that are
        prohibited by Torah law on his behalf. Therefore, one may ask a non-Jew
        to cook for a child who has nothing to eat or to turn on a light in the
home of children who are very scared of the dark (Rema 276:1; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 6; Rema 328:17; 24:6 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the cold areas of northern Europe, keeping homes warm on Shabbat was
        an ongoing struggle. Since homes were generally heated by coal- or
        wood-burning stoves, by Shabbat morning the fuel supply would be
        depleted and the fire in the stove would go out. Since all people are
        considered ill when it comes to extreme cold, the rabbis permitted
        asking a non-Jew to come and light the stove on Shabbat morning (SA
        276:5). The non-Jew who did this was known as the "Shabbos goy."
        Nowadays, however, when heaters are powered by electricity or gas and
        do not run out during Shabbat, there is no justification for using a
        "Shabbos goy" on a regular basis. Only if, by chance, the heater went
        off and it is extremely cold, may one ask a non-Jew to turn on the
        heat. One may do this even if there are no small children. In a home
        with children who truly need the heat, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on
a heater even if it is not extremely cold (SSK 23:28; see n. 87        <em>ad loc</em>.).
    </p>
    <p>
        Permission to ask a non-Jew to do <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited
        by Torah law is limited to the needs of the ill. For one who is
        suffering but not ill, one may ask a non-Jew to perform a rabbinically
        prohibited <em>melakha</em> but not one that is prohibited by Torah
        law. Based on this, some maintain that on a hot day one may ask a
        non-Jew to turn on an air conditioner, claiming that turning on an air
        conditioner is only rabbinically prohibited. Accordingly, for the sake
        of the mitzva of <em>oneg</em> <em>Shabbat</em>, and in order to
        alleviate great suffering, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on an air
        conditioner. However, since others maintain that turning on an air
        conditioner is prohibited by Torah law (17:2 above), it is proper to
        ask the non-Jew to turn it on using a <em>shinui</em> (for example,
        using a teaspoon to depress the air conditioner’s on button), which
        renders the action a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the air conditioner is running and has gotten too cold, one may ask
        a non-Jew to turn it off. Preferably, one should simply tell him that
        it is too cold, and allow him to figure out on his own that he should
        turn off the air conditioner. If he does not take the hint, one may
        tell him directly.

        6. Employees, Sharecroppers, and Renters in Fields and Factories
    </h2>
    <p>
        A Jew may not hire workers to do work for him on Shabbat, as a Jew may
        not ask a non-Jew to do anything for him on Shabbat that he may not do
        himself. Therefore, a Jew may not hire a non-Jew to work in his field,
        factory, or store. However, one may hire a non-Jewish worker to help
        serve food or wash dishes on Shabbat. Since a Jew may do these
        activities on Shabbat, he may hire a non-Jew to do them. In this case,
        it is not necessary for the Shabbat payment to be subsumed within a
        weekday payment (<em>Tehila Le-David</em> 243:1; SSK 28:63; and above
        22:14).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a non-Jew did some work for a Jew on Shabbat, the Jew may not
        benefit from it on Shabbat. After Shabbat he may benefit from it, but
        only once enough time has elapsed so that the <em>melakha</em> could
        have been performed after Shabbat. If the <em>melakha</em> that the
        non-Jew did for him was done publicly on Shabbat, such as building a
        home, the Sages decreed that he may never live in the house. However,
        he may sell it to another Jew. Under pressing circumstances, the first
Jew may live in the house the non-Jew built for him (SA 244:3-4 and MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 19-20; SA 325:14 and MB <em>ad loc</em>. 73).
    </p>
    <p>
        All of the above applies to a wage earner. In contrast, a non-Jewish
        sharecropper or tenant farmer in a Jew’s field may work on Shabbat.
        Since he shares in the profits, he is working for his own benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, a Jewish factory owner or store owner may allow a non-Jew to
        run his business over Shabbat if the non-Jew receives a percentage of
        the earnings. Even though the Jew is profiting from the work of the
        non-Jew on Shabbat, since the non-Jew is working to earn money for
        himself, he is not viewed as working on behalf of the Jew. The Jew may
        profit from a percentage of this work.

        Similarly, a Jew in Israel who owns a field, factory, or store abroad
        may rent them to a non-Jew in return for a set fee. The non-Jew may
        then keep the establishment open on Shabbat. Since the Jew gets his
        rent money in any case, the non-Jew who works on Shabbat is viewed as
        working for himself. This is on condition that the non-Jew is not only
        renting on Shabbat, because then it would be clear that the Jew wants
        the non-Jew to work on Shabbat. Rather, he should rent out the store on
        a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, so Shabbat is subsumed within the
        total.

        7. <em>Marit Ayin</em> and Causing a Jew to Sin
    </h2>
    <p>
        Every case where we have learned that a Jew may rent his store or
        factory to a non-Jew or give his field to a non-Jewish sharecropper
        applies only where there is no <em>marit ayin </em>("appearance" of
        transgression). However, if the site is known to be Jewish-owned, and
        those who see it operating on Shabbat are liable to suspect the owner
        of hiring non-Jews to work for him on Shabbat, such rental or
        profit-sharing arrangements are prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is what the Sages meant when they forbade a Jew to contract his
        bathhouse to a non-Jew to operate on Shabbat. Since generally
        bathhouses were run by day laborers, people who saw the bathhouse open
        on Shabbat would suspect that a Jew had desecrated Shabbat by hiring
        non-Jews. This could breach the boundaries of Shabbat, as others might
        begin hiring non-Jews to work for them on Shabbat. However, if it was
        publicly announced that the Jew rented the bathhouse to a non-Jew, it
        is permitted. So too, if the widespread local custom is to operate
        bathhouses under profit-sharing arrangements, the custom may be
        followed (SA 243:1-2).
        <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        The same applies to a store. If it is known that a store is
        Jewish-owned, one may not rent it out to a non-Jew who will open it on
        Shabbat, because of <em>marit ayin</em>. However, if it has been
        publicly announced that the store has been rented to a non-Jew, it is
        not prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if there is a possibility that Jews who do not observe Shabbat
        will enter this store and shop there on Shabbat, the Jew is not viewed
        as aiding their transgression, since they could buy what they need in a
        different store. However, if most prospective customers are Jews, and
        keeping the store open breaches the boundaries of Shabbat, then the
        arrangement is prohibited (see <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:39).

        8. Non-Jewish Contractors
    </h2>
    <p>
        The prohibition on hiring non-Jews to work on Shabbat applies to
        wage-earners but not to contractors. For these purposes, "contract
        work" means that the worker agrees to complete a job by a specified
        date for an agreed-upon amount of money. It makes no difference which
        days the contractor works. As long as he finishes the work by the
        agreed-upon date, he receives payment in full. Since the non-Jew can
        complete the work without working on Shabbat, even if he works on
        Shabbat it is for his own benefit, to complete the job he contracted,
        and is permitted even though the Jew benefits from the swift completion
        of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a Jew may make an agreement with a non-Jew to sew clothes
        or make shoes for him for a certain sum. The non-Jew’s choice to work
        on Shabbat does not make it prohibited. However, a Jew may not ask a
        non-Jew on Friday to sew clothes or make shoes for him by the time
        Shabbat ends, since in order to do so the non-Jew would have to work on
        Shabbat. This is the equivalent of a Jew asking a non-Jew to work for
        him on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, a Jew may bring his car to a non-Jew’s garage on Friday,
        even though he knows that the non-Jewish mechanic might fix it on
        Shabbat. Since the non-Jew is being paid contractually, at the going
        rate for the job, and the Jew did not ask him to work specifically on
        Shabbat, he is not viewed as working for the Jew on Shabbat. Even if he
        informs the Jew immediately after Shabbat that he finished working on
        the car, the Jew may retrieve the car and use it. However, one may not
        arrange with the mechanic to finish the job by a time that would
        require him to work on Shabbat. In such a case, the non-Jew is working
        for the Jew on Shabbat (SA 244:1; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 2).
        <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        A non-Jew may only do contract work for a Jew on Shabbat if it is not
        apparent that the work is being done on a Jew’s behalf. If it is
        apparent, as is the case if the work is being done in the Jew’s home,
it is forbidden to contract the work to a non-Jew because of        <em>marit ayin</em>. Therefore, the Sages instructed that one should
        not allow a non-Jewish contractor who is hired to build a home to work
        on Shabbat, since if people see the contractor working they will think
        that the homeowner has desecrated Shabbat by hiring a non-Jew to work
        on Shabbat (SA 244:1). Today, when the norm is to hire a contractor to
        build one’s home, it would seem that it should be permissible to be
        lenient. Observers will generally assume that the non-Jewish workers
are working for a non-Jewish contractor, and there will be no issue of        <em>marit ayin</em>. However, in practice, the custom is to be
        stringent and follow the opinion that even today people will likely
        suspect the homeowner of building his house using wage-earners (Ran).
        Furthermore, there is a concern that the homeowner, who knows that his
        house is being built on Shabbat, will end up supervising the
        construction and desecrating Shabbat. However, under pressing
        circumstances, for a great need, where there is a concern that if the
        non-Jews do not work on Shabbat the construction will not be completed,
        one may be lenient at the instruction of a halakhic authority.

        9. Partnerships, Stocks, and Banks
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a Jew and a non-Jew have joint ownership of a store or factory, they
        must agree when they enter into the partnership that the non-Jew will
        be responsible for the store on Shabbat and all of that day’s earnings
        will be his, while the Jew will be responsible for the store on a
        designated weekday and all of that day’s earnings will be his. For the
        remainder of the week, they may split the earnings evenly. This assumes
        that the owners keep track of the store’s daily earnings so that these
        calculations can be made. If each day’s profit is roughly similar or
        cannot be determined, they may split all the profits evenly. Then it is
        assumed that each partner collects the earnings of the day when the
store is his sole responsibility (SA 245:1; SAH<em> ad loc</em>. 5; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 5-6; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 2:65).
        <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is all, of course, on condition that it is known that they are
        partners, so there is no concern that observers will think that the
        non-Jew is working for the Jew. Alternatively, the partnership is
        permissible if it is common to have profit-sharing arrangements in this
        type of business.

        One may purchase stock in a company that is managed by non-Jews and
        does business on Shabbat, because the non-Jews running the company on
        Shabbat are doing so for their own profit. The Jew’s profit is a
        byproduct (SA 245:4). Even when it is likely that the company employs
        Jews who desecrate Shabbat as part of their work, a stockholder is not
        responsible for this. Those Jews are desecrating Shabbat in any case,
        so buying stock does not directly abet their Shabbat desecration (see
        above, n. 9). However, if the company is run by Jews, or if the
        majority of its work is done by Jews who are desecrating Shabbat, a
        stockholder would become a partner in Shabbat desecration. Thus, one
        may not purchase stock in such a company.

        If a bank is under Jewish ownership and has non-Jewish clients, it may
        enter into an agreement with a bank under non-Jewish ownership
        specifying that on Shabbat the non-Jewish bank will take care of all
        necessary transactions for the Jewish bank’s non-Jewish clients. The
        non-Jewish bank is not viewed as working for Jews on Shabbat; since it
        profits from each transaction, it is viewed as working for its own
        profit (<em>Melamed Le-ho’il</em> 1:33).

            <em>Smag</em>
            , <em>Lo Ta’aseh</em> §75, indicates that this <em>Mekhilta</em>
means that the prohibition of asking a non-Jew to do            <em>melakha</em> is a Torah law. <em>Beit Yosef</em> §244 quotes
            this. However, the overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em>
            maintain that the prohibition is rabbinic, and the verse is not the
            law’s source but merely a support for it. This is stated by Rambam
            (MT 6:1); Ramban, Shemot 12:16; SAH<em> </em>243:1; and SHT 243:7.
There are two reasons presented for this prohibition. Rashi (            <em>Shabbat </em>153a) writes that if one requests that a non-Jew
            perform <em>melakha</em> for him, it is as if the non-Jew is acting
            as the Jew’s proxy. Alternatively, Rambam suggests that if one asks
            a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> for him, he will take Shabbat less
            seriously and thus may come to do <em>melakha</em> himself (MT
            6:1). Either way, the rabbinic prohibition is an extension of the
            Torah’s command that servants rest on Shabbat, as explained above
            in 9:10.
        </p>
        <p>
            One may not even ask a non-Jew on Shabbat to do <em>melakha</em>
for a Jew after Shabbat (MB 307:9) or ask him before Shabbat to do            <em>melakha</em> for a Jew on Shabbat. However, one may hint to a
            non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> in the future. For example, one may
            say: "Why didn’t you turn off the extra light in my house last
            Shabbat?" The non-Jew will realize that the Jew would like him to
            turn out the light the next Shabbat (SA 307:2).

            The prohibition on benefiting from <em>melakha</em> done by a
            non-Jew on Shabbat is explained in <em>Shabbat</em> 122a, while the
            need to wait after Shabbat is explained in <em>Beitza</em> 24b.
            According to Rashi and Ran, the reason for the first prohibition is
            so that one will not benefit from <em>melakha </em>done on Shabbat;
            while according to <em>Tosafot</em> and Ramban, it is so that a Jew
will not desecrate Shabbat by asking a non-Jew to do            <em>melakha</em> for him (MB 325:29). If the <em>melakha</em> is
            undertaken publicly so that everyone knows that it was done for a
particular Jew, that Jew may never benefit from it (SA 325:14; MB            <em>ad loc.</em> 73).

            However, after Shabbat a Jew may benefit from these products
            immediately, since the non-Jew picked, caught, or milked them for
            his own use (SA 325:5). According to some, a Jew may not benefit
            from bread that was baked by a non-Jew on Shabbat, for two reasons.
            First, it is <em>muktzeh</em>.<em> </em>Second, there is a concern
            that the Jew will end up requesting that the non-Jew bake for him
            on Shabbat in the future. Others permit benefiting from the bread,
            maintaining that since a non-Jew may bake on Shabbat, the bread is
            not <em>muktzeh</em>. One may rely upon this opinion under pressing
            circumstances or for the sake of a mitzva (SA 325:4).

        <p>
            In 17:9 above, we explain that if one forgot to remove the light
            bulb in the refrigerator, he may suggest to a non-Jew to take some
            food for himself from the refrigerator. Even though the light will
            turn on when the non-Jew opens the refrigerator, the request is
            permitted because he is not telling the non-Jew explicitly to
            perform a <em>melakha</em>. Afterward, one may ask the non-Jew to
            remove the light bulb. Since turning off a light is only
rabbinically prohibited, removing the bulb is a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em> for the sake of a mitzva, as explained
            below in section 5.

            In a case where there is a possibility of major financial loss,
            such as a fire, the Sages permitted saying to a non-Jew: "Whoever
            puts it out will not lose" (SA 334:26). This is because in such a
            case, it would likely be ineffective to say: "Too bad about the
            house," because the non-Jew cannot be expected to expend effort to
            put out the fire if he does not expect to be rewarded. If the Jew
            hints that a reward is involved, this will motivate the non-Jew to
            expend major effort to help the Jew. Therefore, the Sages permitted
            hinting that the non-Jew will profit, even though this is the type
            of hint that is generally not permitted because it encourages the
            non-Jew to take action and is thus considered a kind of command.

            If one sinned by explicitly asking a non-Jew to turn on a light in

According to <em>y</em>. <em>Sanhedrin</em> 10:5 and            <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Ketubot</em> 30a, s.v. "ha-kol"), heat causes
            more suffering than cold but does not cause as much illness as the
            cold. Therefore, the Sages permitted asking a non-Jew to do a
            rabbinically prohibited activity in order to avoid the heat, but
            not one that is prohibited by Torah law. For those who say that
            turning on an electrical appliance without a heating element is
only rabbinically prohibited, asking a non-Jew to do so is a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>; accordingly, one may alleviate great
suffering, and even more so when the mitzva of <em>oneg</em>            <em>Shabbat</em> is involved as well. Many rule accordingly (SSK
13:39; <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 3:23-24;            <em>She’arim Metzuyanim Ba-halakha</em> 90:20). In contrast,
            according to those who maintain that using electricity is
            prohibited by Torah law (17:2 above), asking a non-Jew to turn on
            the air conditioner is only a single <em>shvut</em>. Therefore, one
            should ask the non-Jew to turn it on using a <em>shinui</em>. Then
            all would agree that the case is a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. If it
            cannot be turned on using a <em>shinui</em>, one may ask the
            non-Jew to turn it on normally rely on the opinion that turning on
            an air conditioner is only rabbinically prohibited when asking a
            non-Jew to do a <em>melakha</em>, which itself is only rabbinically
prohibited. Furthermore, we can take into account the opinion of<em>I</em><em>tur</em> that one may ask a non-Jew to do even a            <em>melakha</em> that is prohibited by Torah law for the sake of a
            mitzva, as explained in 9:11 above. As for turning off an air
            conditioner, all <em>poskim</em> agree that it is only rabbinically
            prohibited, so one may ask a non-Jew to do this for the sake of the
            mitzva of <em>oneg</em> <em>Shabbat</em> or in order to alleviate
            great suffering, since such a case is a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>.
            Thus <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 3:42 permits asking a non-Jew to turn
            off the air conditioner in the synagogue, so that the congregants
            can remain there.

            1:29 is permissive even if the non-Jew is an employee with a
            regular salary, as long as he also gets a small commission for each
            sale. In this case too, the non-Jew is viewed as working for
            himself. This is a possible solution for owners of factories and
            telemarketing firms. If their employees receive a commission for
            each sale, they can be viewed as working for their own benefit.
            Ĥatam Sofer requires that this commission be a significant amount.
            If it is minimal, then an employee’s primary motivation remains his
            regular salary paid by the Jewish owner (OĤ 59).

The Sages distinguished between different cases: If a            <em>melakha</em> is performed outside the <em>teĥum</em>, one need
            not be concerned about <em>marit ayin</em> (SA 244:1). It is
            important to be aware that big businesses stand to lose large
            amounts of money if they do not operate on Shabbat. In such cases,
            even if the business is known to belong to a Jew, a profit-sharing
            arrangement can be made with a non-Jew. The Jew may even buy the
            business <em>le-khatĥila</em> with such an arrangement in mind (SA
            244:6). One may be lenient to prevent a large potential profit from
            being forfeited (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:53). One may rent a
business to a non-Jew for all <em>Shabbatot</em> (Rema,            <em>ad loc</em>.). It is preferable to rent it for a few hours on
            Friday as well, so that the Shabbat rent can be subsumed within the
            weekday (see BHL <em>ad loc</em>. s.v. "de-vimkom" and MB 243:16).
            Additionally, when dealing with big businesses, there is less
            concern about <em>marit ayin</em>, because whatever the companies
            do is generally public knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first glance, it seems problematic to forbid certain
            arrangements because of <em>marit ayin</em>, as doing so would seem
            to violate the principle that we do not make a protective fence
            around a protective fence ("<em>gezeira li-gezeira</em>"). After
            all, the prohibition of asking a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> is
already rabbinic. So why disallow these arrangements?            <em>Pri Megadim</em> (<em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 244:1) explains
            that the prohibition of asking a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> is
            supported by a verse and therefore treated more stringently than
            regular rabbinic rules.

            <em>Binyan Tziyon</em>
            §15 and <em>Meshiv Davar</em> 2:31 permit a Jew to assign work to a
            non-Jewish contractor who has Jewish employees who might work on
            Shabbat, because even without him they would desecrate Shabbat;
            thus, the Jew does not transgress <em>lifnei iver </em>("Do not put
            a stumbling block in front of the blind" - Vayikra 19:14). If he
            were to assign them the work on Shabbat, he would be viewed as
            aiding (<em>mesayei’a</em>) their violation. However, when it is
            assigned before Shabbat, there is no prohibition. This point is
            made in the book <em>Amira Le-nokhri</em> 77:16. Along the same
            lines, Maharsham 2:184 permits renting one’s home to Shabbat
            desecrators. However, if most customers of a rented store will be
Jews, R. Eliezer Waldenberg forbids the rental (            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:39). It seems correct to be stringent
            when such an arrangement will breach the boundaries of Shabbat.

            This is the opinion of MA 307:4; <em>Taz</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 3;
            SAH<em> </em>252:4; MB 247:4 and 252:15; and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
            23:173. However, according to <em>Beit Yosef</em> (307:3), as long
            as one did not explicitly tell the non-Jewish contractor to work on
            Shabbat, even if it would be impossible for him to finish the job
by the time specified without working on Shabbat, it is permitted.<em>Minĥat Kohen</em> 1:4,<em> Beit Yehuda</em> 1:44,            <em>Rav Pe’alim</em> 2:43, and <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 3:17 concur.
            In a time of need, such as if one needs the car urgently on Sunday,
            one may rely on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is impossible to agree upon a price for the work in
            advance, as for example when one brings a car to a garage without
            knowing what the problem is. In such a case, if an agreement was
            reached that the going rate for the job would be paid, or that a
            price for the job would be worked out, then since the non-Jew knows
            he will receive reasonable payment for his work, he is considered a
            contractor. But if the non-Jew is uncertain that he will receive
            the going rate, even if he knows he will receive some payment, he
            is viewed as working for the Jew, and a Jew may not arrange for him
            to work on Shabbat on the Jew’s behalf (SA 247:2; BHL 252:2, s.v.
            "im katzatz"). If the non-Jew volunteers to do the work for free,
            since he hopes to be rewarded, it is considered contract work. If
            the Jew requests that he work for free, and the non-Jew agrees,
            according to SA 247:4 this is also considered contract work and is
            permitted, while according to Rema it is preferable to be
            stringent.

            According to Rambam, Rosh, Ramban, and others, if a non-Jew
            accepted contract work from a Jew, he may be allowed to work on
            Shabbat. Only if this type of work is generally done by
            wage-earners is it prohibited on account of <em>marit ayin</em>, so
            that no one will think that they are wage-earners working for a Jew
            on Shabbat (SA 243:1; see BHL, s.v. "she-ken"). In contrast, Ran
            and those who follow him maintain that even when it is common
            practice for a field to be contracted out, it is still prohibited
            to let a non-Jew work there on Shabbat. Since the non-Jew does not
            receive a share of the produce the way a sharecropper does, he
            resembles a wage-earner and it will lead people to hire day
            laborers. Thus, according to Ran, one may not contract the
            construction of a house. Although other Rishonim agree with Ran,
            the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient position. This is the
            ruling of SA and Rema 244:1 as well as <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em> and
            R. Akiva Eger. (Additionally, there are Rishonim who maintain that
            even in a place where many regularly hire wage-earners one may
            still contract a field to a non-Jew, since people will think that
            he is a sharecropper. Rabbeinu Tam even considers permitting
            contract work indoors.) While in practice we do take the opinion of
            Ran into account, and the common practice is not to rely on those
            who are lenient to use a contractor to build a house, nevertheless
            one may be lenient under pressing circumstances at the instruction
            of a halakhic authority. Thus MB 244:13 states that if a synagogue
            is being built where there is a possibility that unless building
            continues on Shabbat it may not get built at all, a non-Jewish
            contractor may build it on Shabbat. Following this reasoning, in
            times of need the practice is to be lenient and allow a non-Jewish
            contractor to build homes in Judea and Samaria, if there is a
            chance that building there will be halted. See BHL 244:1, s.v. "o
liktzor" and <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 3:35. According to            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 244:1, if an agreement was reached with a
            contractor to remove construction waste within a few days, and the
            non-Jew shows up on Shabbat, one need not object. Since this type
of job is generally done by a contractor, there is no problem of            <em>marit ayin</em>.

            What if they did not initially make this agreement? When they come
            to divide the profits, the Jew may not say to the non-Jew, "You
            take the profits from Shabbat, and I will take the profits from one
of the weekdays." The non-Jew would then be considered the Jew’s            <em>shali’aĥ</em> on Shabbat, because the Jew would receive the
            profits from the given weekday as a direct result of the non-Jew’s
            Shabbat work. If they wish to split the profits equally, without
            stating explicitly that the Jew has worked on a weekday to make up
            for the non-Jew having worked on Shabbat, they may not do so
            according to Rambam and SA 245:1, but according to Rosh it is
            permitted. Rema permits as well if one would otherwise incur a
            major financial loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this is relevant to a business in which the two partners do
            not generally both work at the same time and thus the non-Jew’s
            work on Shabbat is in addition to the evenly-divided work during
the week. In such a case, the non-Jew is considered the            <em>shali’aĥ</em> of the Jew, which is prohibited. However, if it
            is a business in which they do generally work at the same time, and
            the non-Jew wants to work alone on Shabbat, the Jew may split the
            profits with the non-Jew, as the non-Jew is considered like a
            sharecropper in this case. Since he is working for his half of the
            profits, he is not viewed as the Jew’s <em>shali’aĥ</em> (Rema
            245:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 9-11).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the store’s sales on Shabbat are double the volume on weekdays,
            the partners should agree from the outset that Shabbat profits will
            belong to the non-Jew, while the profits from two of the weekdays
            will go to the Jew.

            If it is impossible to publicize the fact that the non-Jew is a
            contractor or sharecropper, then as long as the non-Jew is a minor
partner in addition to being a contractor or sharecropper,<em>marit ayin</em> is not a problem (            <em>Responsa Maharam Schick</em>, OĤ 97). This is also quoted as
            the ruling of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
            ch. 23 n. 376. However, <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> qualifies this,
            explaining that it works only when the business does not need the
            non-Jew to work on Shabbat. Nevertheless, as we saw in n. 10, many
            disagree with this and are lenient. In a time of need, one may rely
            upon them. When a major financial loss is involved, all would allow
            leniency, as explained in n. 8.

See <em>Minĥat Yitzhak</em> 3:1, 3:31:2, and            <em>Amira Le-nokhri</em> ch. 67. <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, p.
            130 permits the purchase of stock in a Jewish company that does
            business on Shabbat, on condition that the stocks are bought after
            they have already been traded, i.e., from a previous shareholder.
            Since the company is open on Shabbat in any case, buying its stock
            did not cause it to do any additional work. In contrast, buying
            initial shares is forbidden. Even though the company will work on
            Shabbat in any case, this purchase aids in the commission of a
            transgression. In my humble opinion, one should be stringent even
            about buying shares from a shareholder, as shareholders are in some
            sense partners in the company. Accordingly, if the company is
            Jewish, the shareholder is a partner in Shabbat desecration. In any
            case, under pressing circumstances, the lenient opinions may be
            used in combination with others.

            One may place a limit order (an order to buy or sell stocks when
            they reach a certain price), even though non-Jewish brokers might
            end up buying or selling the stocks on Shabbat. Since the stocks
            could hit the threshold at any time, he has not specified that the
            non-Jews work for him on Shabbat. Therefore, the brokers are making
the purchase in order to earn their percentages. See            <em>Amira Le-nokhri</em> 67:6, which rules stringently in this
            case.

            One may receive daily interest on money that is held in a
            Jewish-owned bank (assuming the bank uses a <em>heter iska</em> - a
            method of restructuring a loan as an investment). Even though one’s
            account receives interest on Shabbat, this is not considered
            earning money on Shabbat. Since the bank considers a day to start
            in the afternoon, the interest accrued on Shabbat is subsumed
            within the interest accrued from Friday and Saturday night (aee
            above, 22:14 and n. 9.) If one signs a standing direct deposit or
            direct withdrawal order at a non-Jewish bank in which the money
            will be transferred according to secular dates and occasionally on
            Shabbat, it is preferable that he let the bank workers know that he
            does not need the transaction to take place on the exact date, and
            that from his perspective it is acceptable if they do it a day
            earlier or later. Then, even if they execute the transaction on
Shabbat, they are doing so for their own convenience (            <em>Ĥeshev Ha-efod</em> 3:51).
