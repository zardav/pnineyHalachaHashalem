            1. Women are Exempt from All Prayers That Follow the <em>Amida</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from all the passages that men customarily recite
after the <em>Amida</em>: <em>Taĥanun</em>, <em>Ashrei</em>,<em>La-menatze’aĥ</em>, <em>Kedusha De-sidra</em>(<em>U-va Le-Tziyon</em>), <em>Shir shel Yom</em> (The Psalm of the
Day), <em>Pitum Ha-ketoret</em> (the mixture of the incense), and        <em>Aleinu</em>. This is because not even men have an absolute
        obligation to recite them; rather, customarily recited them for several
        important reasons, and the custom eventually became obligatory. But
        women never took on this custom, and hence they are certainly not
        obligated. Women are only obligated to recite the <em>Amida</em>, not
        the subsequent customary prayers; however, women who wish to enhance
        the mitzva may recite those passages.

        Nevertheless, it is worth studying the laws of these passages in order
        to complete our study of the laws of prayer and so that one who wishes
        to enhance the mitzva will know how to do so properly.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        After the conclusion of the <em>Shaĥarit Amida</em>, it is customary
        for men to "fall on their faces" and plead before God. By doing so,
they fulfill the mitzva of prayer in all three of its positions –        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> while sitting, <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
        while standing, and <em>Taĥanun </em>("Supplication") while bending
        forward ("<em>Nefilat Apayim</em>"). We learn this from our teacher
        Moshe, who pleaded to God to forgive Israel following the sin of the
        Golden Calf.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>
        possesses a special power and is most effective in times of distress.
        Indeed, we see that when God commanded Moshe and Aharon, during their
        dispute with Koraĥ and his followers, "Separate yourselves from this
        group and I will destroy them in an instant," they immediately
        understood that they must pray intensely. Therefore, they prayed in
        prostration: "They fell on their faces and said: ‘Lord, God of all
        living souls, if one man sins, shall You become angry at the entire
        community?’" (Bamidbar 16:21-22). By virtue of their prayer recited in
        prostration, the decree was cancelled.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>
        is so powerful because it expresses the complete surrender of the self
        to his Creator and total self-sacrifice. It is as if the person is
        saying to the Almighty: "All my senses and limbs are void before You.
Do to me as You will, for I am all Yours." Thus, the prayer of        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> can repair flaws that cannot be repaired
        through regular prayer (see <em>Zohar</em> <em>Bamidbar</em> 120:2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>
        also expresses man’s shame before God. After the <em>Amida</em>, in
        which we addressed God’s greatness and set all our requests before Him,
        we are ashamed to show our faces. How did we dare stand before Him in
        prayer? So we fall down on our faces. <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> also
        conveys our sorrow as we repent of our sins; we are so anguished that
        we cannot lift our faces (see Rabbeinu Baĥya on Bamidbar 16:22).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Despite its great virtue, the Sages did not ordain        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> as an obligatory prayer or fix its wording.
        Anyone who wished would add prayers of supplication while lying
        prostrate after reciting the <em>Amida</em>. Perhaps specifically
        because of its superior value – its expression of total submission to
        the Creator – it is fitting that it comes from the heart, from one’s
        unguarded resolve.

        <a name="_Toc402175296">3. Reciting <em>Taĥanun </em>Today</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        At first, it was customary to perform <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> by
prostrating or by bowing down. Prostration ("<em>hishtaĥavaya</em>")        <em> </em>is when the person praying lies face down, completely
horizontal to the ground, with his arms and legs extended. Bowing ("        <em>kida</em>")<em> </em>is when he goes down on his knees and bends
        his head forward until it touches the ground (<em>Berakhot</em> 34b;
        MT, Laws of Prayer<em> </em>5:13-14).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
However, due to a number of concerns, the practice of        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> while bowing or lying prostrate was annulled.
        Some of the reasons are halakhic and are connected to the prohibition
        on prostrating oneself on a stone floor and the prohibition on an
        important person falling on his face before the congregation without a
        promise to be answered like Yehoshua bin Nun. Still, the main concern
        appears in <em>Zohar</em> (Bamidbar 121:1), which greatly reinforces
        the virtue of <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>, during which the person praying
        must devote his soul to God and view himself as if he has left the
        world, thereby atoning for all his sins. However, if one does not
        surrender his soul in sincerity, he endangers his life, and therefore
the custom is not to fall onto the ground. (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 21:3).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In practice, it is the custom of all Ashkenazim and some Sephardim to
        bend forward and lean their head on their arm. By doing so, one
        maintains a certain aspect of <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>, for that is a
        type of bow, yet it is not a complete bow, and there is no fear of
prostration on a stone floor (BHL 131:1). Those who follow        <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em> are careful not to fall on their face at all, and
        that is the practice of many Mizraĥi Jews.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
During the period of the Ge’onim, a fixed text for        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> and the supplications after the <em>Amida</em>
        began to crystallize, a process that continued through the time of the
        Rishonim until all Israel accepted the recitation of certain specific
        supplications as an obligation. It seems that as a result of the
        ever-intensifying suffering of the Exile, hearts were dulled to the
point at which it was necessary to introduce a fixed text for        <em>Taĥanun</em>. <em> </em>But since <em>Taĥanun </em>became
        widespread only after the scattering of Diaspora communities, the
        differences between the Sephardic and<em> </em>Ashkenazic rites are
        more pronounced.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Since the <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> prayer is one of heartbreak, negation
        of the body, and self-sacrifice, it is not recited on happy days (as
        listed in the <em>siddur</em>). <em>Taĥanun </em>is also omitted when
        someone celebrating a joyous occasion – for example, a bridegroom or a
participant in a <em>brit mila</em> – is present in the synagogue (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 21:7-8). It is also omitted in a house
of mourning, since the divine attribute of judgment (        <em>midat ha-din</em>) prevails there and should not be aggravated (MB
        131:20).

            4. How to Perform <em>Nefilat Apayim </em>(for those who practice
            it)
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        As mentioned, according to Ashkenazic custom and that of some
        Sephardim, <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> is performed while sitting by
        lowering one’s head and leaning it on his forearm while slightly
        inclining the face to the right, so that one does not directly face the
        floor. She must cover her face with clothing or a sleeve. It is not
        sufficient for her to bury her head in her arm, since the arm and the
        face part of the same body, and the body cannot cover itself (SA 131:1;
MB <em>ad loc.</em>). The main reason that the face must be covered is        <em>tzni’ut</em>, like that of one who hides her face from God out of
        trepidation and shame. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, one who is wearing short
        sleeves and does not have a handkerchief may lean on her bare arm. If
        there is a table there, she rests her head and arm on it, and the table
is considered the main cover for her face (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 21:4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>
        is customarily performed only where a Torah scroll or even other
        printed sacred texts<em> </em>are present. Where there are no sacred
        texts, the <em>Taĥanun </em>prayer is recited while sitting, without
falling on one’s arm. In Jerusalem, it is customary to perform        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> even in a place without sacred books, since the
sanctity of the city serves as a substitute for books (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 21:4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Where it is impossible for someone to perform <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>
        while sitting – for example, if there is no chair available or if
        someone is praying the <em>Amida</em> directly behind her and she
        cannot go elsewhere – she may perform it while standing (MB 131:10). If
        she is next to a wall, it is best that she leans her arm and head
        against the wall, in the manner of <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>, so that
        without the wall she would fall. In this way, she is considered to be
        partially sitting and bowing (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 38).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175298">5. The <em>Taĥanun </em>Passages</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman who wishes to recite <em>Taĥanun </em>should not make an
interruption by talking between <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and        <em>Taĥanun</em>, because these prayers are more favorably accepted
        when connected to <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> (SA 131:1; MB 1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sephardic custom is to say <em>Vidui</em> (confession) and recite
        the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy before <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>, so
that the atonement that they bring will lead to a climax with        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em> (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 131:5). According to
Ashkenazic and Yemenite (Baladi) custom, we only begin with        <em>Vidui</em> and the Thirteen Attributes on Mondays and Thursdays.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is said that the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy have great power of
        atonement for sins. By accepting the highest level of faith represented
        by the Thirteen Attributes, we connect to God in such a profound and
        exalted manner that our sins become marginal and external to us in
        comparison to inner devotion to God and His actions. This is the source
        of the atonement, and this is why we constantly repeat the Thirteen
        Attributes in <em>Seliĥot</em> and on Yom Kippur.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The Thirteen Attributes are considered a sacred matter (<em>davar she-bikdusha</em>) and therefore requires a <em>minyan</em> (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 21:5). Therefore, a woman praying
        without a <em>minyan</em> who wishes to recite <em>Taĥanun</em> omits
        the Thirteen Attributes.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
In Sephardic custom, Tehilim 25 is recited during        <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>, whereas Tehilim 6 is recited according to
        Ashkenazic rite.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        On Mondays and Thursdays, additional <em>Taĥanun</em> prayers are
        recited, since those days are days of Divine grace when prayer is more
        accepted. The extra passages are recited while standing (SA and Rema
        134:1). The text of <em>Ve-hu Raĥum</em> was compiled by three elders
who were exiled from Jerusalem, as stated in the works of Rishonim (        <em>Abudraham</em>, Raavan, <em>Manhig</em>, <em>Kol Bo</em> §18).
        Therefore, the distinctions in its wording between the various customs
are slight, except that Sephardim add more <em>Taĥanun</em> prayers        <em> </em>before it and Ashkenazim add more <em>Taĥanun</em> prayers
        after it.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Another difference is that in the Sephardic and Ĥasidic rites, the
        additional <em>Taĥanun</em> prayers<em> </em>of Mondays and Thursdays
        are recited after <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>, whereas in the Ashkenazic
        rite they are recited before <em>Nefilat Apayim</em>.

6. <em>Ashrei</em>, <em>La-menatze’ach</em>,<em> </em>and            <em> U-va Le-Tziyon</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        After <em>Taĥanun</em>, and on Mondays and Thursdays following the
Torah reading, men regularly recite three prayers. The first is        <em>Ashrei</em> (<em>Tehilla Le-David</em>). Although this prayer was
        already recited in <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, it is repeated because of
        its considerable significance (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 23:1-2
        and ch. 14 n. 5 state that men recite <em>Ashrei</em> thrice daily).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Afterwards, we recite the psalm "<em>La-menatze’aĥ mizmor le-David</em>
        ,<em> ya’ankha Hashem be-yom tzara</em>" ("For the One Who grants
        victory, a psalm of David. May God answer you on the day of distress";
Tehilim 20), which serves as a continuation of <em>Taĥanun</em>. Since        <em>La-menatze’aĥ</em> invokes the day of distress, it is not recited
        on days of joy (as listed in <em>siddurim</em>; the differences in
        customs are clarified in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 23:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
After that, <em>U-va Le-Tziyon</em>, also called<em>Kedusha De-sidra</em>, is recited. It contains the verses "<em>Kadosh</em>,<em> kadosh</em>,<em> kadosh</em>…" (Yeshayahu 6:3), "<em>Barukh kevod Hashem mi-mkomo</em>" (Yeĥezkel 3:12), and "        <em>Hashem yimlokh le-olam va’ed</em>" (Shemot 15:18). The uniqueness
        of this <em>Kedusha</em> is that the verses are recited along with
        their Aramaic translations. The Sages ordained their recitation (even
though they were already recited in <em>Yotzer</em> <em>Or</em> and in        <em>Kedusah</em> of <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>) so that every person
        praying would learn some verses of the Prophets every day. The verses
        are translated into Aramaic, so that the whole nation, which was fluent
        in Aramaic at that time the prayer was ordained, would understand their
        meaning.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The reason for instituting the recitation of verses from the Prophets
        is so that men, who are commanded to study Torah, to learn verses of
Torah, the Prophets, and the Sages every day. By reciting<em>Shema</em> they study Torah, by reciting these verses of        <em>Kedusha</em> they study the Prophets, and rabbinic teachings are
        added at the end of the prayer service.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The Sages offer great praise for the recitation of        <em>Kedusha De-sidra</em>, stating that after the destruction of the
Temple, it became one of the things in whose merit the world stands (        <em>Sota</em> 49a). Rashi explains that its recitation possesses two
        virtues: it is a form of Torah study, and its verses deal with God’s
        holiness, so when they are recited in a <em>minyan</em>, God’s name is
        publicly sanctified. There is no need to say <em>Kedusha De-sidra</em>
        in <em>Shaĥarit</em> of Shabbat since one’s obligation to study words
of the Prophets has already been fulfilled by reading the        <em>haftara</em>. Nevertheless, to avoid canceling its recitation
        altogether, it became customary to recite it before <em>Minĥa</em>,
        thus adding extra Torah study on Shabbat, particularly study that
        pertains to God’s holiness (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 23:2).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Shaĥarit</em>
        was instituted to correspond to the morning <em>Tamid</em> offering,
        and after the offering of the <em>Tamid </em>sacrifice in the Temple,
        the Levites would recite the <em>Shir shel Yom</em><strong> </strong>
(Psalm of the Day). It therefore became customary to recite the        <em>Shir shel Yom</em> after <em>Shaĥarit</em> (<em>Sofrim</em> 18:1).
        Although it was not instituted originally as an obligation and some did
        not recite it, by the end of the era of the Rishonim, all had already
        adopted it.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Before reciting the psalm, there day is invoked according to the
        format: "Today is the first day from Shabbat," in order to fulfill the
        mitzva of remembering Shabbat every day of the week (based on Ramban on
        Shemot 20:8; Arizal as cited in <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 132:26).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
After the <em>Shir shel Yom</em>, it is customary to recite<em>Pitum Ha-ketoret</em>, introduced by the liturgical poem<em>Ein K-Elokeinu.</em> There are two reasons for the recitation of        <em>Pitum Ha-ketoret</em>: The first is that it corresponds to the
        incense which was offered every morning and evening in the Temple. The
        second is so that all men, who are commanded to study Torah, may study
        the words of the Sages each day, and additional aggadic (non-legal)
        materials were appended to ensure that men study <em>aggada </em>each
        day as well (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 23:5 n. 5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Aleinu </em>
        is regularly recited at the conclusion of <em>Shaĥarit</em> in order to
        imbue faith in God and hope of redemption in our hearts, and so that
        later, when the Jew who prayed meets non-Jews at work and through
business, he will not be enticed by their gods and beliefs (<em>Baĥ</em> §133). Based on Arizal, it became customary to recite        <em>Aleinu</em> after <em>Minĥa</em> and <em>Ma’ariv</em> as well. Due
        to the significance of this prayer, it is customarily recited standing,
        and one bows slightly when saying the words "<em>Va-anaĥnu kor’im</em>"
        ("We bow") in the Ashkenazic rite and "<em>Va-anaĥnu mishtaĥavim</em>"
        ("We prostrate ourselves") in the Sephardic rite (MB 132:9).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Since these passages are all relatively late additions to the prayer
        service, there are differences between various versions of them. For
        instance, in the Sephardic rite,<em> </em>more songs and verses are
added before the <em>Shir shel Yom</em> and the wording of        <em>Pitum Ha-ketoret</em> is longer. There is also a difference in the
        order of the prayers: in the Ashkenazic rite, <em>Aleinu</em> is
        recited before the <em>Shir shel Yom</em>, whereas in the Sephardic and
Ĥasidic rites, <em>Shir shel Yom</em> is recited first, then<em>Pitum Ha-ketoret</em>, and finally, <em>Aleinu</em> (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 23:4-5).
