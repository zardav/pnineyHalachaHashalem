    Chapter Twenty-Three: <strong>The Conclusion of <em>Shacharit</em> and the Laws of <em>Kaddish</em></strong>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. <em>Ashrei</em> and <em>Lamenatze'ach</em>
</h2>
<p>
    After <em>Tachanun</em>, (on Mondays and Thursdays following the Torah reading), three passages of prayer are recited.
</p>
<p>
    The first is <em>Ashrei</em> (<em>Tehillah L'David</em>). Although this prayer has already been recited in <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, the Psalm is
    repeated, for the <em>Chachamim</em> say (<em>Berachot</em> 4b), "Whoever recites <em>Tehillah L'David</em> three times daily is promised life in the World
    to Come." First it is recited in <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>; a second time after <em>Tachanun</em>, and a third time before <em>Minchah</em> (see the laws
    of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> earlier in this book 14:3 and note 5).
</p>
<p>
    Afterwards, we recite the Psalm "<em>Lamenatze'ach mizmor l'David</em>,<em> ya'ancha Hashem b'yom tzarah</em>" ("For the One Who grants victory, a Psalm of
    David. May Hashem answer you on the day of distress"), which serves as a continuation of the prayers of supplication (<em>Tachanunim</em>) recited after
    the <em>Amidah</em>.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    Since <em>Lamenatze'ach</em> is a prayer about a day of distress, it is not recited on days of joy. There are various customs surrounding this Psalm.
According to the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Sephardim</em>, the law concerning it is like that of <em>Tachanun</em>, and every day on which    <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited due to the joy of that day, <em>Lamenatze'ach</em> is not recited either. According to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, in
    order for <em>Tachanun</em> to be omitted, a minor joyous occasion is sufficient; however, for <em>Lamenatze'ach</em> to be omitted, the joyous occasion
    must be great. Therefore, when a <em>chatan</em> or a <em>ba'al brit</em> (the father, the <em>mohel</em>, or the <em>sandak</em>) is praying with the
    congregation, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited, yet <em>Lamenatze'ach</em> is. Likewise, regarding the month of Nisan, and the days from Yom Kippur until
    the end of Tishrei, although <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited, <em>Lamenatze'ach</em> is. The only times it is not recited are on holidays, the eve of
    holidays (<em>erev chag</em>), and the day following a holiday (<em>isru chag)</em> (<em>Rama</em> 131:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 35; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
    37). These customs are printed in the <em>siddurim</em> before the <em>Lamenazte'ach</em> paragraph, and each ethnic group follows its individual custom.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. <em>Kedushah D'Sidra</em> - <em>U'va L'Tzion</em>
</h2>
<p>
After that, <em>U'va L'Tzion</em>, also named "<em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>," is recited. It contains the verses "<em>Kadosh</em>,<em> Kadosh</em>,    <em> Kadosh</em>," "<em>Baruch kevod Hashem mimkomo</em>," and "<em>Hashem yimloch l'olam va'ed</em>," with their translation into Aramaic. <em>Chazal</em>
    instituted its recital so that every person praying would merit learning some verses of the Prophets (<em>Nevi'im</em>) every day. That is why the verses
    are translated into Aramaic, so that the whole nation, which was fluent in Aramaic at that time, would understand their meaning. The <em>Chachamim</em>
    highly praise the recital of <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, for after the destruction of the Temple, it became one of the remaining practices in whose merit
    the world stands (<em>Sotah</em> 49a). <em>Rashi</em> explains that its recital possesses two virtues: the virtue of Torah learning, and that the verses
    discuss Hashem's holiness. In <em>Shacharit</em> of Shabbat, there is no need to say <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, for one's obligation to learn the Prophets
is already fulfilled by reading the <em>Haftarah</em>. Nevertheless, to avoid cancelling its recital altogether, it became customary to recite it before    <em>Minchah</em>, thereby adding some extra learning on Shabbat, particularly learning that pertaining to the sanctity of Hashem.
</p>
<p>
Some say that the <em>Chachamim</em> established the recital of <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> when hostile rulers decreed upon Israel not to recite<em>Kedushah</em>, and persecutors would stand guard at the prayer services until after the <em>Amidah</em> repetition. After the guards left, the<em>minyan</em> would recite <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>. Even after the decree was abolished, the custom to recite <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> endured (    <em>Shibolei Haleket</em> 44; <em>Beit Yosef</em> 132:2).
</p>
<p>
    Hence, <em>Kedushah</em> is recited three times in <em>Shacharit</em>: first in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yotzer HaMeorot</em>, again in the <em>Amidah</em>
    repetition, and a third time in <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>. Similarly, we find that many important prayers were established to be recited three times, such
    as <em>Tehillah L'David</em> (<em>Ashrei</em>) every day, and <em>Vayechulu</em> on <em>Erev</em> <em>Shabbat</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Kedushah</em>, the congregation recites the verses "<em>Kadosh</em>" and "<em>Baruch</em>" in unison. This is true in <em>Kedushah d'Sidra </em>as
    well, and for that reason, the <em>chazan</em> must recite the introductory verse preceding <em>Kedushah</em> out loud. It is best that a person praying
    individually recites these verses in the tune of Torah reading with cantillation signs. This is in keeping with the opinion that, because it is a matter of
sanctity, it necessitates a <em>minyan</em>, but when it is recited in cantillation, it resembles reading from the Torah and thus there is no need for a    <em>minyan</em>. Someone who does not know how to recite the verses with the cantillation signs may recite <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> without them, for
    according to the halachah, an individual praying may also recite <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> since the verses only relay how the angels sanctify the Blessed
    One's Name.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    As a continuation of <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, the <em>Geonim</em> were accustomed to reciting additional verses and requests concerning atonement, faith,
    and Torah. Some recited the entire wording that is before us today (the <em>Siddur</em> of <em>Rav Amram Gaon</em>), and others recited a slightly shorter
    wording (the <em>Siddur</em> of the <em>Rasag</em>). During the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, everyone became accustomed to reciting the full wording that
    we have today, with slight differences between the ethnic groups.
</p>
<p>
    After <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, the <em>chazan</em> recites <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> in which, in addition from the main part of the <em>Kaddish</em>, we
request that our prayers be accepted. Therefore, the <em>chazan</em> must be careful not to talk from the <em>Amidah</em> repetition until after this    <em>Kaddish</em>.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. A Person Who Is in a Hurry - When to Exit and What to Skip
</h2>
<p>
The recital of <em>Tehillah L'David</em> (<em>Ashrei</em>) and <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> is more important than saying <em>Tachanun</em>, for the<em>Chachamim</em> laud the person who recites <em>Tehillah L'David</em> three times daily, declaring that he has a place in the World to Come (    <em>Berachot</em> 4b). About <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, <em>Chazal</em> say that it is one of the things in whose merit the world exists after the
destruction of the Temple (<em>Sotah</em> 49a), whereas the recital of <em>Tachanun</em> is voluntary (<em>Tur</em> 131, in the name of<em>Rav Natrunai Gaon</em>). Therefore it is better that an individual praying on his own, who does not have time to complete everything, recites    <em>Tehillah L'David</em> and <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> (<em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 2:8).
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the virtue in reciting <em>Tehillah L'David</em> and <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, whose basis is derived from the Talmud, is preferable to the
    recital of <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> (the Psalm of the Day), <em>Pitum</em> <em>HaKetoret </em>(the passage of the incense), and <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em>,
    which were customarily recited during the time of the <em>Geonim</em> and <em>Rishonim</em> (<em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 9:58-60).
</p>
<p>
One who is praying in a <em>minyan</em>, and must leave before the end of the prayer service, should try to stay at least until after    <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, and even refrain from beginning to remove his <em>tefillin</em> before the conclusion of its recital (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    25:13). When possible, he should leave his <em>tefillin</em> on until after <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 25:56). All this is only in
extenuating circumstances; however, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, one must hear another two <em>Kaddishim</em> - <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> after    <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> and <em>Kaddish</em> <em>d'Rabbanan</em> after <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>. <em></em>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> - Psalm of the Day
</h2>
<p>
The <em>Shacharit</em> prayer was instituted to correspond to the morning <em>Tamid</em> offering, and after the sacrifice of the <em>Tamid</em>, the<em>Levi'im</em> would recite <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> (Psalm of the Day). Therefore, it became customary to say <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> after the    <em>Shacharit</em> prayer service (<em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 18:1). Although it was not instituted originally as an obligation, and some did not regularly
recite it, by the end of the period of the <em>Rishonim</em>, everyone had already become accustomed to doing so.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    Before the Psalm, there is reference to the day: "Today is the first day of the week in relation to Shabbat," in order to fulfill the mitzvah of
    remembering the Shabbat on every day of the week (based on <em>Ramban</em> Exodus 20:8; the <em>Ari</em> as brought in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 132:26).
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, the Psalm "<em>Tefillah L</em>'<em>David</em>" (Psalm 86) is added before <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, as well as a collection of
verses which start with "<em>Beit Yaakov</em>" and "<em>Shir HaMa'alot L'David</em>" (Psalm 124). On days of joyous occasions, when we do not recite    <em>Lamenatze'ach mizmor l'David</em>, <em>ya'ancha Hashem b'yom tzarah</em> (after <em>Ashrei</em>), <em>Tefillah L</em>'<em>David</em> is not said
    either, since the words "<em>b'yom tzarati ekra'eka</em>" ("on the day of my trouble I call You") are mentioned in it (<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 132:11).
These passages are also printed in the <em>siddurim</em> of <em>Nusach</em> <em>Sephard-Chassidi</em>, although many omit them, only reciting    <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, like <em>Minhag Ashkenaz</em>.
</p>
<p>
Another difference between the <em>nusachim</em> is that in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> is recited first, then<em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, and finally <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>; whereas in <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> is recited first, then    <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, and at the end, <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> (the order of discussion in this book is arranged according to the order of prayers
    in <em>Nusach Sephard</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Concerning someone who practices according to one <em>nusach</em> and is praying with a <em>chazan</em> following a different <em>nusach</em>, there is
    disagreement. Some say it is best that he prays in the <em>nusach</em> of the <em>chazan</em>, and others say it is best that he prays quietly in his own
    family's <em>nusach</em>, but that he may not sit when the whole congregation stands for <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em>, so as not to emphasize the
    differences (see also earlier in this book, 6:5).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> and <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em>
</h2>
<p>
    After <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, it is customary to recite <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, preceded by <em>Ein K'elokeinu</em>. There are two reasons for its
    recital. The first is that <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> corresponds to the incense which was offered every morning and evening in the Temple. The second is so
    that every Jew may merit learning rabbinic teachings daily.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    In the <em>Zohar</em> (part 2, 212:2), <em>Chazal</em> greatly praise the recital of <em>Pitum</em> <em>HaKetoret</em>, asserting that we are saved,
    through its virtue, from many calamities. There are those who say that one must be very careful not to omit mentioning even one spice from the incense,
    therefore, it was not recited on weekdays, in fear that a person rushing to get to work would skip over one of the spices (<em>Rama</em> 132:2). In
    practice, it is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> that there is no need to be very meticulous regarding this. However, <em>l'chatchilah</em>
    it is proper to recite the passage from the <em>siddur</em> so not to skip a word (<em>Beit Yosef</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:17).
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to recite <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> at the conclusion of the prayer service in order to instill in our hearts faith in Hashem and in our
    promised redemption before we leave off from prayer. Thus strengthened, when we afterwards encounter gentiles at work, or in the course of the day, we
    won't be enticed by their gods and beliefs (<em>Bach</em> 133).<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Due to the significance of this prayer, it is customarily recited while standing, and one bows slightly when saying the words "<em>Va'anachnu kor'im</em>"
    (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:9).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The <em>Kaddish</em> and Its Virtue
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Kaddish</em>
    is special in that its content deals mainly with the respect and glory of Heaven (<em>kevod Shamayim</em>). Therefore, one must have great <em>kavanah</em>
    in his response, be careful not to let his mind wander, and not chatter while it is being recited (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 56:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    1). The <em>Chachamim </em>say about anyone who answers "<em>Amen</em>,<em> Yehei Shemei rabba</em>..." with complete concentration, that a harsh decree of
    seventy years of judgment against him is torn up (<em>Shabbat</em> 119b; <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>). Further, they say that when Jews enter the
synagogues and recite "<em>Yehei Shemei rabba mevorach</em>" out loud, their harsh decrees are nullified (<em>Pesikta</em>, as cited there by the    <em>Tosafot</em>). Additionally, they state that the response to <em>Kaddish</em> arouses Hashem to grant mercy to Israel in exile. When Jews enter
synagogues and study halls (<em>batei midrashot</em>) and respond, "<em>Yehei Shemei HaGadol mevorach</em>," the memory of the exiled Jews ascends before    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, Who shakes His head in pain, so to speak, and says, "Fortunate is the king who is glorified this way in his house," awakening
    the desire to redeem Israel before Him (see <em>Berachot</em> 3a).
</p>
<p>
    By reciting <em>Kaddish</em>, Hashem is sanctified. Therefore, it must be recited in a <em>minyan</em>, for Hashem is only sanctified by an "<em>eidah</em>
    " (a group) of Jewish people. <em>Kaddish</em> was composed in Aramaic, the language in which all Jews were fluent during the Second Temple period. The
    following is a translation of the prayer: "Exalted and sanctified be His great Name in the world which He created according to His will. And may He rule
    His Kingdom, and produce His salvation and draw His messiah near, in your lifetime and in your days (those of the congregation praying), and in the
lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and soon, and say, <em>Amen</em>." The congregation responds, "    <em>Yehei Shemei rabba mevorach l'Alam ul'almei almaya</em>," which is translated as, "May His great Name be blessed forever and ever." The <em>chazan</em>
    continues, "Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted, uplifted, honored, elevated, and lauded be the Name of the Holy One, Blessed is He, beyond all blessings,
    songs, praise, consolations uttered in the world, and say, <em>Amen</em>."
</p>
<p>
    That main part of the <em>Kaddish</em> is also called "Half-<em>Kaddish</em>." Responding to it is of utmost importance, beyond compare. Even a person who
    is in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> is permitted to stop to answer <em>Amen</em>.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button> It is a
    mitzvah to run to hear <em>Kaddish</em>. One who already finished praying and has before him two <em>minyanim</em>, one reciting <em>Kaddish</em> and the
    other <em>Kedushah</em>, it is preferable that he join the <em>minyan</em> reciting <em>Kaddish</em>, for the virtue of <em>Kaddish</em> is greater than
    that of <em>Kedushah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 56:6).<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. The Various Kinds of <em>Kaddish</em>
</h2>
<p>
The <em>Chachamim</em> established the recital of <em>Kaddish</em> at the conclusion of each stage of the prayer service. After the recital of the<em>Korbanot</em>, <em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em> is recited; after the conclusion of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, Half-<em>Kaddish</em>; after<em>Nefillat Apayim</em> and <em>Tachanunim</em>, Half-<em>Kaddish</em>; following <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> is recited; after<em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, Mourner's <em>Kaddish </em>(<em>Kaddish Yatom</em>); and after <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, <em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em> (    <em>Shibolei HaLeket</em> 8). With the <em>Kaddish</em>, we close each stage of the prayer service and elevate it towards the most supreme objective, the
    respect of Heaven, and from there we continue on to the next stage.
</p>
<p>
There are four versions of <em>Kaddish</em>: <strong>1) Half-<em>Kaddish</em></strong>. This is the essence of the <em>Kaddish</em>. It is called Half-    <em>Kaddish</em> so as to distinguish it from other <em>Kaddishim</em> which contain further additions. In any section of prayer where a prolonged
interruption is undesirable, Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited. <strong>2)</strong> <strong><em>Kaddish Yehei Shelama</em></strong>, also called    <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Shalem</em> (Full<em>-Kaddish</em>). This is recited after saying verses of Scripture, and contains an added request for peace and
    good life for us and for all Israel. We conclude, "<em>Oseh shalom bimromav</em>. <em>v'imru Amen</em>". Since this <em>Kaddish</em> is usually recited by
people who have lost a parent, it is also called <em>Kaddish Yatom</em> (Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em>). <strong>3)</strong>    <strong><em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em></strong>. The <em>chazan</em> recites this <em>Kaddish</em> after the conclusion of the <em>Amidah</em>. In it, before
    the addition of <em>Kaddish Shalem</em>, a request is added that our prayers be accepted. <strong>4)</strong> <strong><em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em></strong>.
This <em>Kaddish</em> is recited after learning rabbinic teachings. Before the addition of <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Shalem</em>, we add a prayer in this    <em>Kaddish</em> for those who learn Torah, that they should merit long and prosperous lives.
</p>
<p>
    Responding <em>Amen</em> to these additions is not as important as responding to the main part of the <em>Kaddish</em>. Therefore, one may not interrupt
    the recital of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in order to respond to them.7
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. The Order of the <em>Kaddishim</em> Recited at the End of the Prayer Service
</h2>
<p>
    Following the prayers of supplication after the <em>Amidah</em>, Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited. On days on which <em>Tachanun</em> is not said, the
    Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited immediately after the <em>Amidah</em>.<em> </em>The reason that only Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited is to prevent
    interruption between the <em>Amidah</em> and <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>, which is recited after <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>. As long as the <em>chazan</em>
    has not recited <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>, he has not yet completely finished the <em>Amidah</em> repetition. Therefore, the <em>chazan</em> need not take
three steps back upon the conclusion of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, for he separates from prayer by taking three steps back at the end of    <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>. On Mondays and Thursdays, when the Torah is read, Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is also recited after the Torah reading. We already
    learned that after <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, the <em>chazan</em> recites <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>.
</p>
<p>
    After <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, Full<em>-Kaddish </em>is recited, the <em>Kaddish</em> said after the recital of Scriptural verses. Customarily, mourners are
    the ones to recite this <em>Kaddish</em>, for its recital possesses benefit for the elevation of the deceased person's soul (see earlier in this book
    4:5-6). If no mourner is present, one who does not have a parent recites it. However, if there is no one there who has lost a parent, it is customary not
to recite this <em>Kaddish</em>, for, since it is normally recited by mourners, it is unbecoming for one whose parents are both alive to recite it.    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
After <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, <em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em> is recited, for it was instituted to be recited after rabbinic study. This type of    <em>Kaddish</em> is also usually recited by mourners. When there is no one present who has lost a parent, it is customary not to recite it. In principle,
    the correct practice is that the <em>chazan</em> recites it, because it is not called Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em>. However, since orphans have become
    accustomed to reciting it, many treat it like Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> greatly praise the virtue of this <em>Kaddish</em>, and teach that after the destruction of the Temple, it is one of the things in
    whose merit the world stands (<em>Sotah</em> 49a). The reason for this is because it is recited after a group of people (at least ten) learn Torah, and
hence, its recital combines the mitzvah of Torah study, equivalent to all the <em>mitzvot</em>, and the sanctification<em> </em>of Hashem's Name (    <em>Rashi</em>).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. <em>Barchu</em>
</h2>
<p>
    For those who arrive at the synagogue late, after the beginning of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, and miss the response to <em>Barchu</em> by the
    congregation, the <em>Chachamim</em> established that after the prayer service, the <em>chazan</em> repeats <em>Barchu</em>. The latecomers, along with the
    entire congregation, answer, "<em>Baruch Hashem HaMevorach l'olam va'ed</em>" ("Blessed is Hashem, the Blessed One, for all eternity"). That is also how we
practice at the conclusion of the <em>Ma'ariv </em>service. According to this, on Shabbat and holidays, there is no need for the <em>chazan</em> to say<em>Barchu</em> at the end of the prayer service, because it is reasonable to assume that even those who came late succeeded in hearing the recital of    <em>Barchu</em> by the people called up to the Torah (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 133:1; <em>Maharitz</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, the introduction to
    section 69). For this reason, those who pray in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> do not recite <em>Barchu</em> after the prayer service on those weekdays on which
    the Torah is read. However, on days when the Torah is not read, it is always customary to recite <em>Barchu</em> without verifying whether there is someone
    who needs to make it up, so as not to trouble the congregation to determine if there is a latecomer present.
</p>
<p>
    According to the <em>Ari</em>, <em>Barchu</em> is always recited after the prayer service, because according to his <em>Kavanot</em>, it is necessary to
    say <em>Barchu</em> twice in every prayer service, once before <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and a second time at the end of the service. The same is true
for <em>Ma'ariv.</em> That is the custom of those who pray in <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, and the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Chassidim</em> as well (    <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 133:1).
</p>
<p>
    In every <em>nusach</em> of prayer, <em>Barchu</em> is recited after <em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em>, which is the last <em>Kaddish</em>, so that even the last
    of the latecomers will succeed in hearing it. It is customary that the one who recites <em>Kaddish</em> says the <em>Barchu</em> as well. However,
sometimes the one reciting the last <em>Kaddish</em> is a child who lost a parent and has not yet reached the age of <em>mitzvot</em>. In such a case, the<em>chazan</em>, who is obligated to perform the <em>mitzvot</em>, must be the one to recite <em>Barchu</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:4).    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. Is Another <em>Kaddish</em> Recited After <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em>?
</h2>
<p>
After <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> there is no need to recite another <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> because it was already said after    <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>. Likewise, there is no reason to recite <em>Kaddish</em> on verses of Scripture twice within such a short amount of time. Even
    according to the <em>Kavanot HaAri</em>, there is no room for another <em>Kaddish</em>, and that is the custom of the <em>Sephardim</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, in Ashkenazic<em> minyanim</em>, mourners are accustomed to reciting <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> on verses of Scripture twice. In
    other words, <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> is recited after <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> and again after <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>. This law depends
    upon whether or not it is permissible to recite additional <em>Kaddishim</em>.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>

The <em>poskim</em> write that every person must hear seven <em>Kaddishim</em> every day, corresponding to what is written (Psalms 119:164), "<em>Sheva bayom hillalticha</em>" ("I praise You seven times daily") (<em>Beit Yosef</em> 55:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:5). According to the    <em>Ari</em>, one must hear twelve <em>Kaddishim</em> daily.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>

    11. The Laws of <em>Kaddish</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Due to the importance of the <em>Kaddish</em>, the laws pertaining to it resemble the laws of the <em>Amidah</em> prayer. Therefore, the person reciting
    the <em>Kaddish</em> must stand, customarily with his legs together. Also, just as it is forbidden to pass within the four <em>amot</em> of a person
praying the <em>Amidah</em> (see earlier in this book, 18:18), so too, it is forbidden to pass within four <em>amot</em> of a person reciting    <em>Kaddish</em>. This prohibition applies until the end of the Half-<em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Birkei Yosef</em>; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:9).
</p>
<p>
    Some say that since the <em>Kaddish</em> is considered to be a matter of sanctity, the congregation must stand when the main section of <em>Kaddish</em> is
    recited, or at least until they answer "<em>Yehei Shemei rabba</em>..." (<em>Rama</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 56:7-8). Similarly, it is necessary to stand
    when responding to <em>Barchu</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 146:18). Some say that it is not obligatory to stand for matters of sanctity, yet those who
    were standing at the beginning of <em>Kaddish</em> must remain standing, and those who were sitting before it began may continue to sit, which is also how
    the <em>Ari</em> practiced (<em>Maharil</em>; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 56:20; 146:20-21).
</p>
<p>
    Before the <em>chazan</em> reaches the last portion of the <em>Kaddish</em>, he performs the actions done at the end of the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. He
bows and takes three steps back. He then bows to the left and says, "<em>Oseh shalom bimromav</em>", bows to his right and says, "<em>Hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu</em>", and then bows in front of him and says, "<em>V'al kol Yisrael v'imru Amen</em>" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 56:5; 123:1).    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p>
    Some follow the custom that the <em>chazan</em> bows slightly at every place in which the congregation answers <em>Amen</em>. Others bow at different
    places, and there are those who do not bow at all.<button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p>
There are differing customs regarding the response of "<em>Yehei Shemei rabba</em>...." According to the Ashkenazic and Yemenite (<em>Baladi</em>)<em>minhagim</em>, we conclude, "<em>L'alam ul'almei almaya</em>." According to the Chassidic and Yemenite (<em>Shami</em>) custom, we add "<em>Yitbarach</em>" as well. According to the Sephardi<em>c minhag</em>, we recite until "<em>d'amiran b'alma</em>." Another difference is that after "    <em>Berich Hu</em>," the <em>Ashkenazim</em> answer "<em>Berich Hu</em>" and according to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em>, whoever succeeds in finishing
until "<em>d'amiran b'alma</em>" responds <em>Amen</em>, and whoever does not, refrains from responding to "<em>Berich Hu</em>."    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
</p>
<p>
    When a person answers "<em>Amen Yehei Shemei rabba</em>..." he should pause between "<em>Amen</em>" and "<em>Yehei Shemei rabba</em>," for <em>Amen</em> is a
    response to what the <em>chazan</em> said previously, and "<em>Yehei Shemei rabba</em>" is a praise in itself (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 56:2).

    12. <em> Kaddish</em> After Learning
</h2>
<p>
    It is a mitzvah to recite <em>Kaddish</em> after every learning session. If verses of Scripture are learned, <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> is
    recited. Following rabbinic study, <em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em> is recited. It is customary that after rabbinic study, words of <em>aggadah</em> are added,
for they please the heart, and consequently, the <em>Kaddish</em> recited afterwards is said out of happiness (<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 55:1; and see<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:9). Therefore, after <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, further words of <em>aggadah</em> are added about one who learns    <em>halachot</em> every day and about <em>talmidei chachamim</em> who increase peace in the world.
</p>
<p>
Some maintain that <em>Kaddish</em> is not to be recited unless ten people learn together, be it verses of Scripture or <em>Chazal</em>'s teachings (    <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> 55:5). Others say that even when two people learn together, and immediately upon their conclusion ten men assemble
    there, they may recite <em>Kaddish</em> on their learning (<em>Magen Avraham</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 54:9 and 55:2). The custom is that one who
    wishes to recite <em>Kaddish</em> after his learning says aloud, "Rabbi Chananya son of Akashya says, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> wanted to grant Israel
    merit, therefore He gave them the Torah and <em>mitzvot </em>in abundance," etc. Since ten people hear these rabbinic words, they are considered to have
    learned, and then all opinions agree that <em>Kaddish</em> may be recited. Similarly, when saying <em>Kaddish</em> upon the recital of verses of Scripture,
    the person saying it should first say three verses aloud, and afterwards he may recite <em>Kaddish</em> according to all opinions.

            This is Psalm 20. It is appropriate to recite Psalm 20 after the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> which contains nineteen <em>berachot</em>, since it
            follows a sequence - nineteen and then twenty. However, before the nineteeanth <em>berachah</em> was instituted, when the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
            had only eighteen <em>berachot</em>, the reason this Psalm was still recited after it was because at that time Psalms 1 and 2 were considered to be
            one unit. Psalm 20 was therefore considered to be Psalm 19 and hence served as a continuation of the <em>Amidah</em>.

The <em>Rishonim</em> are also divided concerning <em>Kedushah</em> in <em>Birkat Yotzer HaMeorot</em>, and even in that case the majority of            <em>poskim</em> maintain that an individual is permitted to recite it. Yet, in order to fulfill one's obligation according to all opinions, it is
best to recite it with cantillation signs, as implied from the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 59:3. Regarding            <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, according to more <em>poskim</em>, an individual may recite it. See <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 5, 7:2.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are those who prefer to recite <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em> while standing, as one does for the <em>Kedushah</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>
            repetition. However, the <em>minhag</em> is to recite it while sitting, which is the <em>minhag</em> of the kabbalists, and hence, it can be
            understood that this <em>Kedushah</em> does not require a <em>minyan</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:3 writes that an individual who did not yet finish <em>Lamenatze'ach</em> or <em>Ashrei</em> when the congregation
            already arrived at the verses of <em>Kedushah</em> should skip ahead in order to say those verses with the <em>minyan</em>. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            writes that he should not skip, for it is more important to recite the prayers in their correct order. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:4 writes
            that the translation of the verses into Aramaic must be recited quietly. <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah </em>writes that the <em>Ari</em> was not strict
            concerning this.

One who mistakenly recited <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> after <em>Tachanun</em> says <em>Kaddish Shalem</em> without <em>Titkabal</em> after            <em>U'va L'Tzion</em> (<em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 26:5). If one forgot to recite <em>Titkabal</em> in the <em>Kaddish</em> after <em>U'va LTzion</em>,
            he says <em>Titkabal</em> in the next <em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 26:11).

            <em>Siddur Rav Amram Gaon</em>
            mentions that <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> is recited. The <em>Rambam</em>, at the end of <em>Sefer Ahavah</em> in his wording of prayer, writes, "Some
            Jews were accustomed to reciting it..." In the Temple, <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> was also recited after the afternoon <em>Tamid</em>, nevertheless, our
            custom is not to recite it at <em>Minchah</em>. The reason for this, explains the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:16, that at times, in the Temple as
            well, if they were late in bringing the libation,<em> Shir Shel Yom</em> was not recited, because songs of praise are not recited at night.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="ftn5">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>
            In <em>Siddur Rav Amram Gaon</em> there is no mention that we recite the passage of the <em>Tamid</em> and <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> before the
            prayer service because the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer itself is considered to be in place of the <em>Tamid</em> offering. <em>Rav Amram </em>writes
that the <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> is recited after the prayer service. In the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, many became accustomed to reciting            <em>Korbanot</em> and <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> before prayer, based on the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Ta'anit</em> 27b, which states that its recital
            is considered to be a substitute for its offering.
        </p>
        <p>
Further, the initial <em>minhag</em> was to recite <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> before <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>, as written in the <em>Siddur</em> of            <em>Rav Amram Gaon</em>. So writes the <em>Tur</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 133, and <em>Rama</em> 132:2. This <em>minhag</em> was changed based on
the <em>Ari</em>, who switched the order based on the progressive sequence of the worlds (see earlier in this book, 13:2); therefore,            <em>Shir Shel Yom</em> now precedes <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>. However, the question arises, since the order in the Temple was the offering of the
            incense before the song of the <em>Levi'im</em>, how can it be changed? The <em>Eshel Avraham</em> 132 explains that because the incense is already
            recited after the <em>Tamid</em> in the passages of the <em>Korbanot</em>, there is no need to recite the incense before <em>Shir Shel Yom</em>
            again. Still, there is reason to recite <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> even after the prayer service, corresponding to its smoke, which would continue to
            rise for a very long time. The explanation based on the <em>Ari</em>, is that the recital of <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> after the prayer service
            saves the prayer from the external forces (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:14). The <em>Shlah</em> writes, based on Kabbalah, that it is customary to
            recite the full <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> service three times daily, twice in <em>Shacharit</em> and another time at <em>Minchah</em>. This is cited
            by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:14 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 133:19. In any case, as I have already written (chapter 13:1, note 2), those in a
            hurry are permitted to recite only the Torah verses dealing with the incense in the beginning of the prayer service, on the assumption that at the
            end of the service they will recite the full <em>baraita</em> concerning the incense.

            The primary place of <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> is in <em>Musaf</em> of Rosh HaShanah, in the beginning of <em>Seder Malchuyot</em>. However,
            during the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, it had became the custom to conclude the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer with <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em>.
Based on the <em>Ari</em>, it became customary to say <em>Aleinu</em> after each of the three daily prayers (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 132:7;            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 11-12).
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Kolbo</em> writes that Yehoshua composed the wording of the <em>Aleinu</em> prayer. Some say that Achan said "<strong><em>A</em></strong>            <em>l <strong>K</strong>en <strong>N</strong>ekaveh</em>" when admitting his sin. However, <em>Netiv Binah</em>, part 1, pp. 373-374 writes that it
            is <em>Rav</em> who composed the prayer.

According to the opinion of the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:17, one who is in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> or<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> responds to the <em>Kaddish</em> in two places: "<em>Amen</em>,            <em> yehei Shemei rabba mevorach l'alam ul'almei almaya</em>," and also "<em>Amen</em>" at the end. According to the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 66:23, he
            responds with all five <em>Amen</em>s in the main part of the <em>Kaddish</em>. See the laws of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> in this book, 16:5.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to state that according to <em>Minhag Sephard</em>, the <em>chazan</em> says "<em>v'yitzmach purkanei vikarev meshichei</em>" in
            the wording of the <em>Kaddish</em> and the congregation responds <em>Amen</em>, whereas in <em>Minhag Ashkenaz</em>, those four words are not
recited. The root of this difference lies in the teachings of the <em>Geonim</em>. In <em>Siddur</em> <em>Rav Amram Gaon</em> and<em>Machzor Vitri</em>, the <em>Kaddish</em> is written like <em>Minhag Ashkenaz</em>, and in <em>Siddur Rav Sa'adyah Gaon</em> and in the            <em>Rambam</em> it is like <em>Minhag Sephard</em>, although only "<em>v'yitzmach purkanei</em>" is mentioned (see <em>Netiv Binah</em>,<em> </em>
part 1, p. 366). Further, it should be noted that in the main part of the <em>Kaddish</em> this is the only distinction; however, at the end of the            <em>Kaddish</em>, there are many differences, for in the main part of the prayer the original <em>nusach</em> that <em>Chazal</em> instituted was
            better preserved. But, in the additions made by the sages of the generations after the scattering of the exiles, the discrepancies between the
            wordings are more pronounced.

            It is written in the <em>Zohar</em>, part 2, 129:2, that the virtue of the <em>Kaddish</em> is greater than the other <em>Kedushot</em> for it has
            in it the power to break all the barriers of evil and sanctify Hashem in all the worlds. Therefore, it is recited in Aramaic, in order to strike
            the external forces in their own external tongue.

            Even though the <em>Rama</em> 132:2 writes that someone whose parents do not object may indeed recite this <em>Kaddish</em>, in actuality, this was
            not the custom, for fear of a bad omen (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 132:17; <em>Az Nidberu</em> 13:33). Nonetheless, when there is a great need,
            such as when the father is unable to recite <em>Kaddish</em> and it is necessary for a different family member to say <em>Kaddish</em> for the
            grandfather, and both parents agree, then the grandson would be permitted to recite <em>Kaddish</em> for his grandfather.

            Many <em>Acharonim</em> (among them, <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em>, <em>Chayei Adam</em>, <em>Shetilei Zeitim</em> 55:9) write that just like it is
best to minimize the number of <em>berachot</em> that one recites, so it is best to say as few <em>Kaddishim</em> as possible. The            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:1 adds that some <em>Acharonim</em> forcefully challenge the practice of those who assembled to recite verses or
            rabbinic teachings and say <em>Kaddish</em> a few times. Instead, one <em>Kaddish</em> is recited on the verses and one on rabbinic study, and no
            more. That is what is written in <em>Az Nidberu</em> 13:33, and hence <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> may not be recited twice at the end
            of the prayer service. By contrast, <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> 132:2 writes that many <em>Kaddishim</em> may be added, and that the law
            concerning them resembles the law of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy which are recited many times in <em>Selichot</em>. Since Hashem's Name is not
            mentioned in the <em>Kaddish</em>, the <em>Kaddish</em> is not considered to be recited in vain. He continues that this is how he practiced when he
            was a <em>chazan</em> and there was no mourner present - he himself recited <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Yehei Shelama</em> twice at the end of the prayer
            service. The <em>Ari</em>'s opinion, that there is no place for a <em>Kaddish</em> after <em>Aleinu</em>, is brought in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:1;
            48:1, at the end of s.v. "<em>V'Da Hakdamah</em>."
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, the <em>Eshel Avraham</em> 132:2 writes that it is proper to adjoin <em>Barchu</em> to <em>Kaddish</em> just as it is customary to do
            regarding the <em>Barchu</em> before <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> in <em>Shacharit</em>. Therefore, the <em>minhag</em> (in <em>Nusach Sephard</em>
            ) to say a few verses before <em>Ma'ariv</em> and <em>Kaddish </em>after them became widespread. Similarly, at the end of the prayer service, it is
            proper to recite <em>Kaddish</em> before <em>Barchu</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, formerly, the custom in Ashkenaz was that only one person would recite <em>Kaddish</em>, and when there were a few mourners they would
            take turns. There were times that every mourner merited reciting one <em>Kaddish</em> per week. Perhaps that is the reason that it was customary to
            say Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em> twice, so that more mourners could recite it. When the number of mourners increased as a result of the pogroms, a
            new custom was introduced - that all the mourners would recite <em>Kaddish</em> together. By contrast, the Sephardic custom has always been that
            all the mourners recite Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em> together.

The following are the seven <em>Kaddishim</em> (as written in <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:5): 1) Half-<em>Kaddish</em> after<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, 2) Half-<em>Kaddish</em> after <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, 3) <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> after <em>Kedushah d'Sidra</em>, 4)<em>Yehei Shelama</em> after <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> (according to <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>), 5) Half-<em>Kaddish</em> after <em>Ashrei</em> in<em>Minchah</em>, 6) <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> after <em>Minchah</em>, and 7) Half-<em>Kaddish</em> in <em>Ma'ariv</em> between            <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. The <em>Kaddish</em> after <em>Ma'ariv</em>, even though it is a mitzvah, is not included
            in the seven.
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:1, based on the <em>Ari</em>, adds another five, as follows: 1) <em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em> before <em>Hodu</em>, 2)<em>Kaddish d'Rabbanan</em> after <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> in <em>Shacharit</em>, 3) Half-<em>Kaddish</em> before <em>Barchu</em> of<em>Ma'ariv</em>, 4) <em>Kaddish-Titkabal </em>after <em>Ma'ariv</em>, and 5) <em>Kaddish Yehei Shelama</em> after the verses following            <em>Ma'ariv.</em> Some are accustomed to adding another <em>Kaddish</em> on the verses recited after <em>Minchah</em>, which makes a total of
            thirteen <em>Kaddishim</em>. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:21 writes further that if the mourners are minors, or the mourner stutters and cannot
pronounce the words properly, it is necessary for another person to say <em>Kaddish</em> with him, so as to complete the required number of daily            <em>Kaddishim</em>. However, regarding an optional <em>Kaddish</em>, not included in the twelve mentioned above, a minor may recite it himself
            (ibid., 19).<em></em>

            However, <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 56:36 writes that the <em>chazan</em> takes three steps back only in <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>, since it is connected
            to the <em>Amidah</em> prayer, but concerning the remaining <em>Kaddishim</em> that are not linked to the <em>Amidah</em>, there is no reason to
            step backwards. Still, <em>Yabia Omer</em> 5:9 supports the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, that in all <em>Kaddishim</em> he takes three
            steps back. A possible explanation is that the essence of the <em>Kaddish</em> is considered similar to the <em>Amidah</em>, and that alone
            necessitates taking three steps back. This is the <em>minhag</em> of all <em>Ashkenazim</em>.

The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 56:4 writes that the <em>chazan</em> bows at five places during the <em>Kaddish</em>, when saying: 1) "            <em>Yitgadal</em>," 2) "<em>Yehei Shemei Rabba</em>," 3) "<em>Yitbarach</em>," 4) "<em>Berich Hu</em>," and 5) "<em>Amen</em>" (at the end of the
            Half-<em>Kaddish</em>). The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 56:35 writes in the name of a number of <em>Acharonim</em> that he bows every time the
            congregation responds <em>Amen</em>. It seems that even according to his <em>minhag</em>, the <em>chazan</em> bows at only five places; however, he
            bows at the five places in which the congregation responds <em>Amen</em> in the Half-<em>Kaddish</em>. The <em>Gra</em> questions these bows, for
he maintains that it is wrong to add more bows than the ones the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted for the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. The            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 56:7 answers that the bows performed in the <em>Kaddish</em> are minor, unlike those in <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, and
            therefore they are not considered additions to what the <em>Chachamim</em> established.

The <em>Beit Yosef</em> summarizes the opinions and writes in the name of the <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Rashi</em>, <em>Kolbo</em>, and<em>Rabbi David Abudraham</em> that one only says until "<em>almaya</em>," which adds up to a total of 28 letters, and that is<em>Minhag Ashkenaz</em>. However, the <em>Midrash </em>writes that one must be very careful not to separate the words "<em>almaya</em>" and "            <em>Yitbarach</em>," and that someone who does is punished. Therefore, many became accustomed to saying until "<em>d'amiran b'alma</em>," a total
of 28 words. So, it seems, is the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 56:3. This is also written in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 33.<em>Minhag Chassidim</em>, based on Rabbi Yosef Gik'atlya, is to say until "<em>Yitbarach</em>," thereby attaching "<em>almaya</em>" to "<em>Yitbarach</em>." The <em>Magen Avraham</em> writes that this is an ancient custom. However, the opinion of the <em>Gra</em>, based on the            <em>Rishonim</em>, is not to recite "<em>Yitbarach</em>" because this word begins a different praise. The <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>15 provides a
            possible solution - if one says "<em>Yitbarach</em>" after an interruption of a breath, perhaps even according to the <em>Gra</em>, the recital of
            "<em>Yitbarach</em>" would be permissible.
        </p>
        <p>
According to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 56:15, if he reaches a point in prayer in which it is forbidden to interrupt, he may answer only until "            <em>almaya</em>." <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 33 writes that he says everything until "<em>d'amiran b'alma.</em>" <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 66:1 maintains
that between paragraphs or <em>berachot</em> he responds to everything, and in the middle of paragraphs or <em>berachot</em> he answers until "            <em>Yitbarach.</em>"
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 55:2 writes that after the conclusion of "<em>Yehei Shemei rabba</em>...," when the <em>chazan</em> says "<em>Yitbarach</em>," the congregation responds <em>Amen</em>. Today, only the Yemenites practice this way. According to the Sephardic<em> minhag</em>, in which they continue to say until "<em>d'amiran b'alma</em>," it is impossible to succeed in responding <em>Amen</em> after "            <em>Yitbarach</em>," and even to "<em>Berich Hu</em>" they do not always succeed in answering. That is also what is written in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            56:29, that according to the <em>Kavanot</em>, one does not respond <em>Amen</em> after "<em>Yitbarach</em>."
        </p>
        <p>
            It is better to respond to the <em>Kaddish</em> in accordance with the custom of the one reciting it ("<em>Berich Hu</em>," "<em>Amen</em>," etc.),
            as explained earlier in this book 6:5. However, this is usually not the practice, and therefore many are accustomed to answering according to their
            own <em>minhag</em>, despite the fact that it appears slightly like "<em>Lo Titgodedu</em>" (fragmenting the nation into divergent groups with
            different practices).
