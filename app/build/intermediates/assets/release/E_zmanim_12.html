    Chapter Twelve: Lighting the Chanukah Candles
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>12.1 – The Mitzvah to Light Chanukah Candles</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages instituted [a <em>mitzvah</em>] to light candles all eight days of Chanukah, when the Jewish people celebrated and gave thanks to God for helping
    them defeat the Greeks, liberate Jerusalem, and purify the Holy Temple. In addition, the oil in the Temple’s <em>menorah</em> burned miraculously during
    those days.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though lighting Chanukah candles is a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em>, we recite a blessing over it: “Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe,
    Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to light the Chanukah candle.” One could seemingly ask, how can we say “He has commanded
    us,” when the Written Law does not contain such a commandment? [The answer is]: the Torah gives the Sages the authority to institute <em>mitzvot</em>,
    within the guidelines of the Torah, as it says, <em>According to the </em>torah
    <em>
        that they will teach you and according to the judgment that they will say to you, shall you do; you shall not deviate from what they will tell you,
        right or left
    </em>
    (<em>Devarim</em> 17:11). It also says,
    <em>
        Remember the days of old, consider the years of generation after generation; ask your father and he will tell you; your elders, and they will say to
        you
    </em>
    (ibid. 32:7) (<em>Shabbat</em> 23a). Thus, in order to remember and publicize the miracle that HaShem performed on our behalf during the Second Temple era,
    the Sages instituted [a <em>mitzvah</em>] to light candles all eight days of Chanukah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Women are obligated to keep this <em>mitzvah</em> just as men are. Even though this is a time-bound, positive commandment, from which women are usually
    exempt, nonetheless, they too must fulfill this <em>mitzvah</em> because women participated in the miracle, as well (<em>Shabbat</em> 23a; however, the
    custom is for married women to discharge their obligation by way of their husband’s lighting; see below note 2, and above 11.11, note 14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The purpose of all the laws that the Sages instituted regarding where and when to light Chanukah candles is to publicize the miracle. Therefore, they
    required that the candles be lit near the door or in front of a window facing the main thoroughfare, so that passersby can see them (as will be explained
    below, 13.1-3). They also determined that the candles be lit after sunset, when the maximum number of people will see them. After all, darkness has already
    [begun to] descend, making the lights recognizable, and at the same time the streets are still filled with people coming home from work (we will elaborate
    below, 13.4). Publicizing the miracle, however, is not a necessary prerequisite for the fulfillment of the <em>mitzvah</em>. Even a Jew who lives alone on
    a deserted island must light the candles, in order to remind himself of the miracle.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This <em>mitzvah</em> is exceedingly great; even a poor man who cannot afford to buy candles must seek donations or sell his shirt in order to buy Chanukah
candles. [The <em>halachah</em>] does not demand of one to go begging or to sell his shirt for the sake of other <em>mitzvot</em> (see <em>Rama</em>,<em>O.C.</em> 656:1), but since this <em>mitzvah</em> publicizes the miracle [of Chanukah], its obligation is greater. A poor man need not fulfill the    <em>mitzvah</em> in the most elaborate way; it is sufficient for him to light one candle each night (<em>S.A.</em> 671:1, <em>A.H.S.</em> 671:2).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>12.2 – The Number of Candles and the Custom of <em>Mehadrin Min HaMehadrin</em> </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting Chanukah candles is a very beloved one. In general, there are two levels of <em>mitzvah</em> performance: carrying out the
    basic obligation and <em>mehadrin</em>, fulfilling the <em>mitzvah</em> more elaborately. When it comes to Chanukah candles, however, there are three
    levels: the basic obligation, <em>mehadrin</em>, and <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em>, the best possible way. Furthermore, all of Israel has adopted the
    practice to fulfill this <em>mitzvah</em> according to the <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> custom.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Minimally, every household has to light one candle every night of Chanukah, no matter how many people live in the house; and this candle enables them to
    remember and publicize the miracle of Chanukah. Those who are <em>mehadrin</em> (more meticulous) light one candle for every adult member of the household.
    For example, if four [adults] live in the house, they light [all together] four candles every night of Chanukah, demonstrating that everyone has a share in
    the <em>mitzvah</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Those who are <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> (extra meticulous) light a different number of candles each night of Chanukah, and the Rabbis dispute the
    matter. The scholars of Shammai’s academy (<em>Beit Shammai</em>) say that we light eight candles on the first night and subtract one candle every
    subsequent night, eventually lighting one candle on the last night. According to this viewpoint, the number of candles corresponds to the number of days
    yet to come. On the first night, we light eight candles because there are eight more days to Chanukah, and on the last night we light one candle because
    there is only one day left. The scholars of Hillel’s academy (<em>Beit Hillel</em>) say that we light one candle on the first night and add a candle every
    subsequent night, eventually lighting eight candles on the last night. According to them, the number of candles corresponds to the number of days that have
    already passed – that is, every night we light candles according to the number of days the miracle lasted. This way, we demonstrate the magnitude of the
    miracle, because every additional day that [the Hasmoneans] lit the Menorah in the Temple using the same oil flask, the miracle increased. In addition,
    this method allows us to ascend in holiness, until we reach the pinnacle on the eighth night when we light eight candles (<em>Shabbat</em> 21b). All of
    Israel has accepted the <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> custom, according to Beit Hillel’s interpretation (<em>S.A. O.C.</em> 671:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    What emerges, in practice, is that we light thirty-six candles over the course of the eight days of Chanukah. The [prevalent] custom, though, is to light
    an additional candle every night, to serve as a <em>shamash</em> (lit., attendant), so that one can use its light, if needed. After all, it is forbidden to
derive benefit from the Chanukah candles. The <em>shamash</em>, however, is separated from the other candles, because the main objective of    <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> is to make the number of candles recognizable, for that demonstrates the magnification of the miracle (we will elaborate
    below, <em>halachah</em> 10-11).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>12.3 – The Sefardic Custom</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
There are different customs regarding the actual fulfillment of <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em>. According to Sefardic tradition, the main    <em>hiddur</em> (adornment) is to light as many candles as corresponds to the day [of Chanukah that one is currently celebrating]. Even if there are many
    people living in the house, only one of them lights Chanukah candles, based on the number of days that have already passed [in the holiday]. [That is], he
    lights one on the first night, two on the second, and eight on the eighth. After all, the goal is to show how many days the miracle lasted, for this
    publicizes the miracle more. And if everyone in the house would light candles within a <em>tefach</em> (handbreadth) of the doorway, one would not be able
    to recognize which day it is, because everyone’s candles would conjoin and confuse the tally. Since [according to this custom] only one person lights, it
    is fitting for the head of the household to light on behalf of everyone else.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If the children ask to light candles, [their parents] can let them light their own Chanukah menorahs, as long as they are careful to make a separation
    between the menorahs. According to the custom of most Sefardim, [these children] do not recite a blessing [when they light], for that would constitute an
    unnecessary blessing. Rabbi Meshash, however, rules that if they want to merit reciting a blessing, they should have in mind not to fulfill their
    obligation with their fathers’ lighting. Then, they may be meticulous and light the candles with a blessing (<em>Yalkut Shemesh</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 192).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>12.4 – The Ashkenazi Custom: Men, Women, and Children</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to Ashkenazi custom, all members of a household must light their own menorahs in order to fulfill <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em>. [That is],
    on the first night everyone lights one candle and on the eighth night everyone lights eight. We are not concerned that onlookers will not know how many
    candles are being lit on any given night, because we are careful to separate the menorahs from one another.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Children who have reached the age of <em>chinuch</em> (education) light the candles with a blessing. The age of <em>chinuch</em> begins at around six years
    old, which is when children understand the story of the miracle and the commandment [to light].
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The [prevalent] custom among married women is not to light Chanukah candles, because when their husbands light it is considered as if they have lit, for
    “one’s wife is as one’s own body.” In many homes, young women and girls who have reached the age of <em>chinuch</em> also follow this custom of not
    lighting the candles. Nevertheless, they may light with a blessing if they so wish. Seemingly, it is good to encourage young girls who have reached the age
    of <em>chinuch</em> to light the candles, at least until they become bat-mitzvah (12), for the lighting connects them to Torah and mitzvot. And if they
    wish to continue lighting afterwards, they should be blessed. Even a woman whose husband lights candles may light her own menorah, with a blessing, if she
    so wishes, despite the custom.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>12.5 – The Blessings and <em>HaNeirot Halalu</em> </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages prescribed that we say two blessings before lighting the Chanukah candles, so that we focus on the two aspects of the mitzvah. The first blessing
    relates to the mitzvah itself and its formula is as follows: “Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His
    commandments and has commanded us to light the candle of Chanukah” (להדליק נר של חנוכה). Sefardic Jews conclude with, “to light the Chanukah candle”
    (להדליק נר חנוכה).
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    The second blessing expresses our thanks to God for the miracles He performed on behalf of our forefathers at the time of Chanukah. The Rabbis enacted that
    we say it when we light the candles because the candles are supposed to remind us of the miracles and their meaning. Its formulation is: “Blessed are You,
Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has done miracles for our forefathers, in those days, during this time.” On the first day, we add the    <em>She’hechiyanu</em> blessing, which expresses our thanks to God for keeping us alive and sustaining us for another year, giving us the privilege to once
    again reach the days of Chanukah and fulfill the mitzvah of lighting the candles.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Immediately following the blessings, one begins lighting the candles, without talking in-between. After the first candle is lit, the custom is to start
    saying <em>HaNeirot Halalu</em> (which originates in Tractate <em>Sofrim</em> 20:6). Then, while reciting this paragraph, one continues lighting the
    remaining candles. And even though more candles still need to be lit, [reciting <em>HaNeirot Halalu</em>] does not constitute an interruption. After all,
    we already learned that the minimal obligation of the mitzvah is fulfilled by lighting the first candle, while the purpose of the remaining candles is to
    perform the mitzvah more elaborately (<em>hidur mitzvah</em>). And even though one should, ideally, refrain from speaking until after all the candles are
    lit, <em>HaNeirot Halalu</em> [is different]. Since it explains the purpose of the mitzvah, there is room to say that one should recite it specifically
while fulfilling the mitzvah. However, one who finds it difficult to say <em>HaNeirot Halalu</em> while lighting the candles may say it afterwards (see    <em>M.B.</em> 676:8, <em>Mishbatzot Zahav</em> 5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some people recite <em>LeShem Yichud</em> prior to the blessings and <em>HaNeirot Halalu</em>, in order to supplement the mitzvah with [special]
    intentions.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should light each candle well and wait until the flame takes firm hold onto the majority of the wick, not like those who are in a rush and move onto
    the next candle before the previous one is properly lit (<em>B.H.</em> 673:2, s.v. <em>hadlakah</em>).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>12.6 – Family Participation in the Mitzvah </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should try to gather the entire family for candle lighting, so that everyone can hear the blessings, answer “Amen,” and witness the lighting. Besides
    the fact that this glorifies the mitzvah and publicizes the miracle, it is necessary for those who are not reciting the blessings themselves, like women
    and children, who fulfill their obligation with the lighting of their husband/father. By hearing the blessings, they take part in thanking God for the
    miracles. According to the Rambam and Rashi, if the family members do not hear the blessings, they must look at the candles and recite the blessing “Who
    has done miracles,” despite the fact that they have discharged their obligation of lighting the candles with the head of the household’s lighting. The
    Rashba and the Ran, however, maintain that since these family members have fulfilled the mitzvah of lighting, even though they did not hear the blessings,
they do not have to recite “Who has done miracles” upon seeing the candles. Since the matter is under dispute, one should not recite the blessing (    <em>S.A.</em> 676:3). Ideally (<em>le-chatchilah</em>), though, one who is not lighting and saying the blessings himself should hear them [from someone
    else] and answer “Amen,” in order to fulfill the mitzvah according to all <em>poskim</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, anyone who discharges his or her obligation by way of someone else’s lighting, like women or children whose husbands/fathers light for them,
    must take part in the candle lighting ceremony, so that they can hear the blessings and answer “Amen.” And even if they cannot be home for the lighting,
    they should try to be in a different house or in the synagogue when the candles are being lit, thereby fulfilling their obligation according to all
    opinions.

</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>12.7 – The Candles</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    All types of oils and wicks are kosher for Chanukah candles, even those that are unusable for Shabbat candles. After all, the purpose of Shabbat candles is
    to illuminate the house, and if they do not light well, there is concern that one may tilt a candle to improve its light and thus desecrate the Sabbath.
    Therefore, the Sages prohibited lighting Shabbat candles with oils and wicks that do not light well. On the other hand, one is not allowed to use the light
    of the Chanukah candles. Therefore, any type of oil or wick that is capable of staying lit for half-an-hour is kosher for Chanukah candles.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The nicer the candle burns, the more ornamental (<em>mehudar</em>) it is, because the miracle is publicized better this way. Therefore, many people are
    accustomed to lighting wax or paraffin candles, whose flame is strong and nice. Many <em>Acharonim</em> write that it is even better to light with olive
    oil, because its light is lucid, in addition to the fact that it reminds one of the miracle of the oil flask.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Chanukah candles must contain enough fuel to last for thirty minutes, because the Rabbis prescribed that we light from the end of sunset until people
    stop walking around the marketplace, which is around half-an-hour. And even if someone lights indoors, the candles have to be able to last for thirty
    minutes. One who has a small amount of oil or a small candle, which will only burn a few minutes, should light without reciting a blessing.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>12.8 – Electric Lights</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    After electricity was discovered, the question was raised: can one fulfill the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles with electric lights?
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, most <em>poskim</em> hold that one cannot use electric lights, because they do not have wicks and oil like [conventional] candles do.
    Furthermore, since they emit a very strong light, they may be considered like torches, as opposed to candles. Our master, Rav Kook <em>zt”l</em> writes
    that since electricity did not exist when the Sages instituted the mitzvah, it is not considered one of the types of candles that are included in the
    Rabbinic enactment by which one can fulfill the mitzvah (<em>Mitzvat Re’iyah</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 673).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is true that when it comes to Shabbat candles, most authorities hold that – when necessary – one can fulfill the mitzvah, with a blessing, by way of
    electric lights, because the main purpose of Shabbat candles is to provide light. Chanukah candles, however, are meant to remind us of the miracle.
    Therefore, they must resemble the candles of the Holy Temple, and since electric lights are different from candles, one cannot discharge his obligation by
    lighting them.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If one does not have a kosher candle, however, he may – <em>be’di’avad</em> – light an electric bulb, without reciting a blessing. By doing so, he affirms
    the miracle and, according to a few <em>poskim</em>, even fulfills the mitzvah.
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some have a custom to place large, electric Chanukah menorahs, whose light can be seen from afar, in public areas. Even though this does not fulfill the
    Rabbinic commandment [to light Chanukah candles], there is, nonetheless, virtue in doing so, for it reminds the masses of the miracle of Chanukah.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>12.9 – Lighting is the Mitzvah</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The mitzvah is fulfilled by lighting the candles, not by having them lit. This is evident from the formulation of the blessing: “Who has sanctified us with
    His commandments and has commanded us <strong>to light</strong> the Chanukah candle.” Therefore, if one lights candles that can burn for half-an-hour and
    someone knocks them down by accident, causing them to go out before thirty minutes have passed, he need not relight them, because he fulfilled the mitzvah
    at the time of lighting. Even if one lights inferior candles, such that there is some concern that they might go out, he has discharged his obligation,
    assuming that they usually last for thirty minutes. Nonetheless, the <em>Acharonim</em> rule that it is fitting to act strictly and relight the candles, so
    that they may light the half-hour period that the Sages prescribed (<em>S.A.</em> 673:2, <em>M.B.</em> 27).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, if one lights the candles in a place where they cannot burn for half-an-hour, like in a windy area, and the wind actually blows them out before
    they manage to burn for thirty minutes, he has not fulfilled his obligation, because they were not fitting to last the required amount of time from the
    moment he lit them. Most authorities maintain that [in such a situation] one should relight the candles with a blessing. In practice, however, one should
    relight them without a blessing, because the issue is unclear, and the rule is “We are lenient when doubt arises regarding blessings.”
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    As previously stated, the mitzvah is fulfilled by lighting the candles, not by placing them in their proper place. Therefore, if someone lights a candle
    prior to nightfall and puts it down in a place that is valid for Chanukah candles, he has not fulfilled his obligation, since it was not lit for the sake
    of the mitzvah. And even if he lifts it up while it’s lit and then places it down with intention to perform the mitzvah, he has not discharged his
    obligation. Rather, he must extinguish it and relight it for the sake of the mitzvah. Then, there is no need to lift the menorah up and place it down for
    the sake of the mitzvah (<em>Shabbat</em> 23a, <em>S.A.</em> 675:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must light the candles where they are supposed to be set down. Thus, even if the head of the household is ill and cannot get out of bed, one may not
    bring him candles in order for him to light by his bedside, and then transfer them to their proper place. Rather, the head of the household should recite
    the blessings while someone else lights for him where the candles are supposed to be (<em>B.I.Ch.</em>, <em>VaYeishev</em> 6). If one puts the candles on
    the windowsill, but forgets to move them close to the window before lighting, he may move them a bit after the lighting, so that the passersby can see them
    better.

</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>12.10 – The Prohibition of Benefitting from the Candles</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is forbidden to benefit from the light of the Chanukah candles, whether for mundane purposes, like counting money, or sacred ones, like studying
    [Torah]. The reason being that the candles are designated for the mitzvah of Chanukah, and just as it is forbidden to benefit from the candles of the
    Temple menorah, so too, it is forbidden to benefit from the Chanukah candles, which were instituted in commemoration of the miracle that occurred in the
    Temple menorah. Furthermore, the purpose of the candles is to publicize the miracle, and if one were to use their light, it would appear as if he lit them
    in order to illuminate [the room], not in order to publicize the miracle (<em>S.A.</em> 673:1).
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is forbidden to use left-over oil or candles that were not completely consumed, because they were allocated for the mitzvah the moment they were lit.
    Preferably, one should use them for future Chanukah candles, but if they are not fitting for such use, or if they are left over after the eighth night, one
    should make a bonfire and burn them (<em>S.A.</em> 677:4, <em>M.B.</em> 18). Alternatively, one can pour the extra oil down the drain and put the remaining
    wicks in the garbage. Candles left in the package and oil left in the bottle may be used for any purpose.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If one begins lighting the candles and the <em>shamash</em> goes out, he may not relight it using one of the mitzvah candles, because the <em>shamash</em>
is unsanctified and one may not light a mundane candle from a mitzvah candle. If, however, one has used up all his matches, and if he does not relight the    <em>shamash</em> he will not be able to continue lighting the rest, he should light it from a Chanukah candle.
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the letter of the law, one may benefit from the candles after they have burned for half-an-hour. However, the custom is to act strictly and
    refrain from deriving any pleasure from them, even after thirty minutes pass, because the lights still publicize the miracle even then, and if one were to
    use them, it would seem as if he is defaming the mitzvah. Furthermore, since he prepared the candles for the sake of a mitzvah and did not plan on
    benefitting from them after half-an-hour, some say that the entire candle [or cup of oil] has been sanctified for the mitzvah, making it forbidden to use
    it for mundane purposes.
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>12.11 – The Chanukah Menorah and the Shamash</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is fitting to glorify [the mitzvah] and light the candles in a nice menorah, each person according to his means. Some even buy menorahs made of gold or
    silver. One who does not have a Chanukah menorah may stick candles onto a flat surface and light them [just like that]. Similarly, one may take small glass
cups, fill them with oil and wicks, and light them. One should not, however, light the candles in disgraceful vessels, like soot-filled earthenware (    <em>S.A.</em> 673:3, <em>M.B.</em> 28, <em>K.H.C.</em> 60-62).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should be careful to leave space between the candles, so that each one can be seen separately, thus publicizing the miracle. In addition, if the
    candles are too close to one another, their flames may join together like a torch, which disqualifies them. Regarding wax candles, another concern arises:
    if they are too close, they will cause each other to melt before thirty minutes pass (<em>S.A.</em> 671:4, with commentaries).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Technically speaking, one fulfills the mitzvah even if he does not place the candles at the same height or in a straight line, as long as they are separate
    and a person standing close by can tell that they correspond to the days of Chanukah. Similarly, one fulfills the mitzvah by placing candlesticks in a
    circle, seeing that each candle stands alone. Preferably, though, one should place them in a straight line, so that all onlookers can see the candles as
    one and discern their number, corresponding to the miracle (Rama 671:4, <em>B.H.</em> s.v. <em>u-mutar</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to prevent people from violating the prohibition of benefitting from the Chanukah candles, the custom developed to light an extra candle, to serve
    as a <em>shamash</em> (“attendant”). This way, if one needs light where the candles are burning, he will use the light of the <em>shamash</em>. According
    to the letter of the law, one need not light a <em>shamash</em> in a room that has electric lights. Nonetheless, many people light a <em>shamash</em>, in
    order to emphasize the difference between mitzvah candles, whose light we are forbidden to use, and the <em>shamash</em>, whose light we are permitted to
    use.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, in order to avoid miscounting the candles, we place the <em>shamash</em> at a different height or a distance away from the other candles, to make
    it clear to all which are the [main] candles and which one is the <em>shamash</em>. The prevalent custom is to place it higher than the rest, so that if
    someone needs light, it will be clear that he is using the <em>shamash</em>’s light and not that of the other candles (<em>S.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em>
    673:1, <em>M.B.</em> 20).

</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>12.12 – Setting up the Candles and Lighting them</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    When approaching the task of setting up the menorah, one faces a dilemma: Where should he place the candle on the first night? Where should he place the
second candle on the second night? And from which candle is it preferable to begin lighting? Even though one fulfills the mitzvah,    <em>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</em>, no matter how he lights, the ideal practice is as follows: On the first night, one places the candle on the right side
    of the menorah (from the perspective of the lighter, who is facing the menorah), because the right side always takes precedence over the left. On the
    second night, one adds an additional candle to the left [of the first one], and after he recites the blessings, he lights the additional candle first,
    followed by the one to its right. There are two reasons for this: 1) It is preferable to begin with the new candle, which symbolizes the intensification of
the miracle. 2) After lighting the leftmost candle, the lighter will have to turn to his right in order to light the next candle, and our Sages teach (    <em>Yoma</em> 15b) that one should always turn rightward.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    On each subsequent night, one adds a new candle to the left [of the ones he lit on the previous nights] and lights it first. Then, he turns rightward and
    lights the rest. When reciting the blessings, it is proper to stand to the left of the menorah so that the closest candle will be the one he lights first.
    This way, a person avoids skipping over the other candles in order to light this one (<em>S.A.</em> 676:5, <em>M.B.</em> 11).

<a name="13"></a><h2>12.13 – Prior to the Lighting</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One is forbidden to eat a half-hour before candle-lighting time, which is when the stars emerge (as we will explain below, 13.4). One may not even begin a
    light meal, for fear that he may prolong the meal and forget to light. It is also forbidden to drink alcoholic beverages, but one may eat fruits and
    vegetables. One may even eat bread or <em>mezonot</em> foods, as long as he eats less than an egg-size (around 56 grams). [Besides eating], one may not
    begin, during that half-hour period, any type of work that may drag on. Nor should one go to sleep during that time. One may begin to eat, work, or sleep
    during this period if he asks a friend to remind him to light on time. Nevertheless, even if one begins these things in a permissible fashion – i.e., more
    than thirty minutes before candle lighting time – he must stop what he is doing when the stars emerge and light the candles, so as not to miss the time
    that the Sages enacted (<em>M.B.</em> 672:10; <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em>, ibid.; <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 25:9).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who is in the middle of work and cannot get home in time to light at <em>tzeit ha-kochavim</em> (when the stars emerge) may continue working until he
    is finished. However, he must be careful not to eat until he fulfills the mitzvah. And if his work is the kind that can drag on for a long time, to the
    point where there is concern that he will end up forgetting to light the candles, he may continue working only if he asks a friend to remind him to light
    when his work is done (see below, 13.6, 13.9).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is also forbidden to study Torah once the time for candle-lighting arrives. However, if a regular <em>shiur</em> (Torah lesson) takes place at that
    time, and it would be difficult to reschedule it for another time, it is best to go through with the <em>shiur</em> and remind everyone at its conclusion
    to light the candles (see below, 13.6, n. 13).
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>12.14 – Lighting in the Synagogue </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom is to light Chanukah candles in the synagogue; and we recite there all of the blessings that we recite at home. According to Rabbinic law, one
    needs to light only at home. Nonetheless, the custom developed to light in the synagogue, as well, in order to publicize the miracle even more. The candles
    are customarily placed [near] the southern wall of the synagogue, similar to the location of the menorah in the Holy Temple. One does not discharge his
    obligation by way of this lighting, and even the person who actually recites the blessings and lights the candles in the synagogue must relight, with the
    blessings, at home (<em>S.A.</em> 671:7).
    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom is to light the candles between <em>Mincha</em> and <em>Ma’ariv</em>, because that is when the largest number of people are in the synagogue and
    the miracle will be publicized most. After <em>Ma’ariv</em>, however, people are in a rush to get home and light.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In synagogues where they pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> late, significantly after the stars emerge, they should light the candles before <em>Ma’ariv</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Most congregations pray <em>Mincha</em> on Friday afternoon shortly before sunset, making it impossible to light [Chanukah] candles after <em>Mincha</em>,
because that is when one has to usher in the Sabbath. Therefore, people [in such communities] should light before <em>Mincha</em>. Congregations that pray    <em>Mincha</em> a long time before sunset, however, should light the candles after <em>Mincha</em> and make sure to finish lighting a long time before
sunset, so that they can take in the Sabbath before sunset and fulfill the mitzvah of adding from the mundane [weekday] onto the holy [Shabbat] (    <em>M.B.</em> 671:47). On Saturday night, we light the candles [in synagogue] after <em>Ma’ariv</em>, because we do not end Shabbat beforehand.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since the reason for lighting candles in the synagogue is to publicize the miracle, at least ten people must be present at the time of lighting. What
    should one do if ten people have yet to assemble, and it is not possible to delay the lighting – on Friday, for example, when there is concern that the
    congregation will not manage to finish praying <em>Mincha</em> on time? Some say that they may recite the blessings and light the candles even though less
    than ten people will hear the blessings, because ten people will [certainly] gather together afterwards and see the candles (<em>M.A.</em>, <em>M.B.</em>
    671:47, <em>B.H.</em> ibid.). Others maintain that they should light without a blessing (<em>Mor U’Ketzi’ah</em>, <em>K.H.C.</em> 671:72).
    <button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>
</p>
<a name="15"></a><h2>12.15 – Candle Lighting at Public Gatherings</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many people are scrupulous to publicize the miracle and light Chanukah candles wherever people gather, like weddings, bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, Chanukah
    parties, and lectures. The question is: is it permissible to recite a blessing over the lighting at such events?
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many contemporary rabbis hold that one should not recite a blessing, because the blessings are customarily said only in synagogues, and we do not have the
    authority to invent new customs in other places. According to them, one who recites a blessing in places other than a synagogue is pronouncing a blessing
    in vein. The reason we light specifically in synagogues is probably to commemorate the menorah that was lit in the Holy Temple, synagogues being considered
    miniature Temples. In other places, however, it is inappropriate to light with a blessing.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Nevertheless, several <em>poskim</em> maintain that one may light Chanukah candles, with a blessing, wherever there is a public gathering. After all, the
    reason we light in the synagogue is to publicize the miracle; therefore, one should light, with a blessing, wherever the masses gather. It is preferable,
    though, to pray <em>Mincha</em> and <em>Ma’ariv</em> – or even just <em>Ma’ariv</em> – in such a place, thus giving it the status of a synagogue, to some
    degree. Then, a blessing may be recited, as the custom dictates.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, one who wishes to rely on those who hold that it is permissible to light with a blessing may do so. And if the guests at the event include
    secular Jews, who may not have lit candles at home, it is very important to light with a blessing, because only then will everyone stand up – to hear the
    blessings – causing the miracle to be publicized in front of their eyes. They will also learn how to fulfill the mitzvah [properly]. If possible, it is
    preferable to ask someone who is unaccustomed to performing mitzvot to recite the blessings and light the candles. This way, he will become closer to
    faith, Torah, and mitzvot.

            </a>
On a simple level, if the custom of <em>mehadrin</em> is to light one candle per member of the household [every night], then the            <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> custom requires one to light an additional candle per night for everyone in the house. This is the Rambam’s
            opinion (<em>Hilchot Chanukah</em> 4:1-3), as well as the Ashkenazi custom. According to Rabbeinu Yitzchak (<em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Shabbat</em>
            21b), however, only one member of the house lights a menorah, for if everyone lights, [onlookers] will not know what day of Chanukah is being
            celebrated, and the main objective of <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> is to publicize the miracle based on the number of days [it lasted].
            Sefardim follow this custom, as written in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (671:22). (The Re’ah explains that doing it this way glorifies the miracle
            more [than the <em>mehadrin</em> custom does], because most households do not have that many members. Therefore, lighting [one menorah and adding a
            candle every night] amounts to more candles. Furthermore, even if fewer candles will be lit this way, it is preferable that people will have to
            clarify which day of Chanukah it is.) Many authorities explain that the difference between the customs is based on where people used to light.
            Sefardim lit their candles near the entranceway; therefore, if many members of the house would light there, people wouldn’t know which day of
            Chanukah it is. Ashkenazim, on the other hand, were accustomed to lighting inside the house, so everyone is able to light their own menorah. The
            author of <em>Darkei Moshe</em> (671:1) thus writes in the name of R. Avraham of Prague that, according to the <em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em>
custom, everyone in the house must light his or her own menorah when lighting indoors, even according to <em>Tosafot</em>. See            <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 1:4.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Vilna Gaon writes in <em>Bi’ur HaGra</em> that the main reason the Gemara gives for Beit Hillel’s opinion is: “We ascend in holiness,” and one
            need not know what day of Chanukah it is. Rather, the main goal is to increase the number of candles. Thus, the Gra dismisses <em>Tosafot</em>’s
            reasoning, indicating that even when everyone lights at the entranceway, they should light according to the number of people in the house and the
            number of days [that have passed in the holiday].
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some infer from the words of the Rambam that one person should light for everyone, but according to Ashkenazi custom, based on the Maharil,
            everyone lights their own candles and recites their own blessings. Rabbi Rabinowitz writes in <em>Melumdei Milchamah</em> (p. 232) that according
            to Rabbi Kapach’s version [of the Rambam], Ashkenazi custom is the same as the Rambam’s opinion. The Taz (677:1) and Magen Avraham (677:9) explain
            that since the members of the house have no intention of fulfilling their obligation with the head of the household’s blessings, they may recite
            the blessings over their candles. This implies that they would not be able to recite the blessings otherwise, because one does not make a blessing
            over a <em>hiddur</em> (an adornment of a mitzvah). The author of <em>Sefat Emet</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 21b), however, postulates that from the
            very beginning, [the Rabbis] determined that extra meticulous people (<em>mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em>) should recite the blessings, even though
            they have already fulfilled their minimal obligation. Another dispute involves one who lights a single candle, with a blessing, and later obtains
            enough candles to fulfill the mitzvah more elaborately (<em>mehadrin</em>). Should he recite a blessing over the lighting of the extra candles or
not? Eliyah Rabbah holds that he recites a blessing, but according to the Pri Chadash (end of 672), no blessing is said; and Rabbi Akiva Eiger (            <em>Responsa, Tanina</em> 13; study it carefully) seems to lean towards that opinion, based on the implication [made above] from the words of the
            Taz and Magen Avraham.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Does the lighting of the head of a household absolve his family members of their obligation if they planned on lighting by themselves but ended up
            not doing so? This issue needs clarification. In my humble opinion, they discharge their obligation, <em>be’di’avad</em>, because the minimal
            requirement is to have one candle in the house, and there was. Therefore, whether they like it or not, the family members have fulfilled the
            mitzvah unadornedly. The fact that they intended not to discharge their obligation, in accordance with the words of the Taz and Magen Avraham, that
            relates only to the <em>hiddur</em>, i.e., that they will light with a blessing. Regarding the lighting itself, however, they are exempted [by the
            head of the household’s lighting]. The matter still needs further study. The <em>halachah</em> is the same according to the Sefat Emet’s rationale.
            One could also decide leniently based on the rule that <em>bereirah</em> (retrospective designation) applies in cases of Rabbinic law.

            Many Acharonim cite the reason of “one’s wife is as one’s own body,” including <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (671:9, 675:9) and <em>Kaf HaChayim</em>
            (671:16). Several reasons are given to explain why girls in some communities refrain from lighting. The Chatam Sofer (<em>Shabbat</em> 21b)
            explains that since people were accustomed to lighting outdoors, it was considered immodest for girls to go out [and light]. According to the
            author of <em>Mishmeret Shalom</em> (48:2), it is improper for a daughter to light when her mother does not do so. Others explain that the reason
            minors light the candles is in order to train them [in the performance of mitzvot], and since girls will not light when they grow up, because their
            husbands will light for them, they do not light when they are young [either]. (See <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> [Frank] 14, <em>Yemei HaChanukah</em>
            8:3, and <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 2:1-3.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Girls may say a blessing before lighting, if they so desire, as the Mishnah Berurah writes (675:9). After all, Ashkenazi custom allows women to
            recite blessings even over mitzvot from which they are exempted. Certainly, then, they may recite a blessing over the lighting of Chanukah candles,
            which they are obligated to do. And since there are single women and widows who live alone, there is room to say that young women should get used
            to lighting candles, with a blessing, in their parents’ home. According to the predominant Sefardic custom, in which only one person per household
            lights, girls should not recite a blessing if they wish to light.

            The text of the Gemara (<em>Shabbat</em> 23a) reads, להדליק נר של חנוכה, and this is how the Rif and most <em>Rishonim</em> formulate it. Ashkenazi
            custom follows this opinion, as the Mishnah Berurah writes (676:1). On the other hand, the Shulchan Aruch (676:1) writes, להדליק נר חנוכה; and the
            Ari and the Gra concur. Sefardic Jews follow this custom.

            Some say that the blessings of “Who has done miracles” and “Who has kept us alive” were instituted in connection with both the lighting of the
            candles and the day itself. Therefore, one who cannot light candles nonetheless recites these blessings upon the day itself (Meiri). Others
            maintain that these blessings were instituted only in connection with the lighting, and one who cannot light, or [one who merely] sees [lit]
            candles, may not recite them (Rambam). The <em>Acharonim</em>, as well, debate this issue, and the author of <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> (676:3)
remains undecided. According to most <em>Acharonim</em>, however, one should not recite the blessings, out of doubt. See            <em>Yemei Hallel VeHoda’ah</em> 19:4.

            The Talmud states in <em>Shabbat</em> 23a, “One who sees the Chanukah candles must recite a blessing.” [The Gemara] explains that one who lights
            recites two blessings, “To light” and “Who has done miracles,” while one who [merely] sees [candles] recites one blessing – “Who has done
            miracles.” On the first night, the <em>She’hechiyanu</em> blessing is added. [The commentators] disagree on what kind of “seer” the Gemara refers
            to. According to Rashi, Rambam, and Mordechai, one whose relative lights on his behalf, but he fails to hear the blessings, recites the “Who has
            done miracles” blessing upon seeing the candles. This is so because the mitzvah has two components: 1) to light Chanukah candles at home, in order
            to publicize the miracle; 2) to thank HaShem for the miracle by seeing the candles. One whose relative lights on his behalf at home has fulfilled
            the mitzvah of lighting, but since he did not hear the “Who has done miracles” blessing, he has not fulfilled the mitzvah of giving thanks.
            Therefore, he recites the blessing upon seeing Chanukah candles. For example, a woman who did not hear her husband say the blessings when he lit
            must recite “Who has done miracles” when she comes [home] later and sees the candles. Similarly, a household member who was absent when the candles
            were lit recites the blessing of “Who has done miracles” when he walks through the streets and sees Chanukah candles in the window of someone’s
            house. On the other hand, Rashba, Ran, and Smag hold that only one who has not discharged his obligation – because he has no one to light for him –
            recites “Who has done miracles” upon seeing Chanukah candles.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Shulchan Aruch (676:3), Mishnah Berurah (6), Sha’ar HaTziyun (9-11), and Kaf HaChayim (24) rule that one should not recite a blessing, because
the matter is uncertain. See <em>S.A.</em> 677:3 and <em>K.H.C.</em> 23.

Even according to those who hold that the head of the household completely
            exempts everyone of their obligation with his lighting, it is clear that it is preferable for him to perform the mitzvah in the presence of the
entire family. Therefore, he must gather his family together shortly before lighting the candles. This [ruling] is found in <em>M.A.</em> (672:5),            <em>Ch.A.</em> (154:20), <em>M.B.</em> (672:10), <em>B.I.Ch.</em> (<em>VaYeishev</em> 1), and others.

            <em>Shabbat</em>
            21b, 23a; <em>S.A.</em> 673:1. In Tractate <em>Shabbat</em>, 23a, our Sages say that the preferred way to perform the mitzvah is through olive oil,
            but the <em>Gemara</em> implies that this is so only because its light is more lucid. Therefore, some say that wax is just as good as, if not
            better than, olive oil, as the author of <em>Darkei Moshe</em> (673:1) cites. Our master, Rav Kook, concurs in <em>Mitzvat Re’iyah</em>, 673.
However, the Meiri and the Kol-Bo write that olive oil has an advantage in that it reminds one of the miracle. Many Acharonim, including            <em>M.B.</em> (4) and <em>A.H.S.</em> (1), write likewise. Rav Kook and his son Rav Tzvi Yehudah followed this practice. (In terms of the Maharal’s
            opinion, see <em>Machatzit HaShekel</em> 1, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 4, <em>K.H.C.</em> 18, and <em>Yemei Hallel VeHoda’ah</em> 14:21-23.)

            According to the Gemara’s first answer (<em>Shabbat</em> 21b), the time to light is from sunset until people stop walking around the marketplace,
            but according to the second answer, that is the amount of time the candles need to be lit. The Rif, Rambam, and other Rishonim write that this time
            period is half-an-hour long. The Shulchan Aruch (672:2, 675:2) rules accordingly. See <em>M.B.</em> 672:5. However, some <em>Rishonim</em> maintain
that one may fulfill one’s obligation if he lights for less time and with smaller candles. [The reason for this is] either that the            <em>halachah</em> follows the Gemara’s first answer, or that even though the <em>halachah</em> follows the second answer, once people began
            lighting indoors there was no longer a need to light for [half-an-hour], which is the amount of time it used to take for people to return from the
marketplace (<em>Or Zarua, Smag</em>). Therefore, if one does not have enough oil, he should light without a blessing (<em>B.H.</em> 672:2,            <em>s.v. kazeh</em>). See <em>Birur Halachah</em>, <em>Shabbat</em> 21b, notes 4:2, 5; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em>, chap. 6, 27:31.

Some <em>Acharonim</em> maintain that it is possible to fulfill the mitzvah of Chanukah with electric lights. For example: R. Mashash (            <em>Responsa Mayim Chayim</em> 279). R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 15:3) holds that if there is no other choice, one may turn
            on a flashlight and recite a blessing over it (because its filament is similar to a wick). However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that electric
            bulbs are not kosher, and when there is no other choice, one should light them without a blessing. See <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 3:35, where [R. Ovadyah
Yosef] summarizes the various opinions. The <em>Acharonim</em> discuss these distinctions. Our master, Rav Kook writes in <em>Mitzvat Re’iyah</em>,            <em>O.C.</em> 673: “Since they did not exist when <em>Chazal</em> enacted [the mitzvah], one could say that they are not included in the [list of]
            ‘candles’ upon which the enactment took effect. We find a similar idea with regard to the Rabbinic law of “stains,” for we base [their size] on the
bed bugs of their time.” The distinction [I presented] between Shabbat candles and Chanukah candles is explained in <em>Responsa Har Tzvi</em>,            <em>O.C.</em> 2:114, and elsewhere. See <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Shabbat</em>, vol. 1, pp. 67-68 (4:5), [where we explain] that one may
            recite a blessing over an incandescent electric bulb on <em>Shabbat</em>, when necessary.

            See <em>Beirur Halachah</em>, <em>Shabbat</em> 21b; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:24-29. One should not recite a blessing because one may discharge
            his obligation by lighting for less than thirty minutes, as we explained in note 7. Furthermore, sometimes it seems as if the candles will
            certainly blow out, when, in truth, it is not so certain. See <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 673:30. Even if one extinguishes the candles deliberately,
            he should relight them without a blessing, because perhaps he has already fulfilled the mitzvah. Moreover, it is unclear whether putting the
            candles out nullifies the lighting which was done properly. The author of <em>Har Tzvi</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 2:114) writes that if one lights in a
            place where, for external reasons, the candles cannot last half-an-hour, but they nonetheless do, he has discharged his obligation. This is why
            those who light in a glass box fulfill the mitzvah even though they close the opening only after they light, because in actuality the candles can
            stay lit this way for thirty minutes.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to the Maharshal and Taz (<em>M.B.</em> 26), if the candles accidentally go out late Friday afternoon [before Shabbat], one is obligated
            to relight them, because they have not yet burned after sunset. Most <em>poskim</em>, however, hold that this is not obligatory, just very
            appropriate. After Shabbat begins, or after one accepts Shabbat upon himself, everyone agrees that it is forbidden to relight the candles.

            If one transfers the candles from inside to outside, or visa versa, after the lighting, he has not fulfilled his obligation, because an onlooker
            might think that he lit them for his own benefit (<em>S.A.</em> 675:11). This, however, requires further investigation. After all, people do not
            use candles for light nowadays; therefore this concern no longer applies. In practice, though, one should not move the candles from place to place,
            even inside one’s house (<em>M.B.</em> 6). It seems, however, that moving them slightly is permissible, when it is clear that the intention is to
            publicize the miracle [better]. See <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 674:4, <em>Yemei HaChanukah</em> 6:33, <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 9:26.

            According to R. Zerachyah HaLevi (the Razah) and the authour of <em>Sefer HaIttur</em>, one may use the light of the candles for sacred purposes.
            However, Rambam, Ramban, Rashba, Rosh, and others forbid this, and the halachah follows their opinion. The Rosh permits one to use the candles
            temporarily for a mundane purpose, as long as it is not disgraceful, like counting money from afar. Most <em>poskim</em> disagree, as [R. Yosef
Cairo] writes in <em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 673:1. [The Chafetz Chayim] writes in <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> (s.v.<em>ve-yeish</em>) that one may be permitted to use the candles temporarily for a sacred cause, like learning a small [piece of Torah]. In            <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> (11), he adds that one may walk in a place where the light of a Chanukah candle helps prevent him from tripping. That is,
he need not close his eyes, because that is not considered utilizing the light. See <em>Birur Halachah</em>, <em>Shabbat</em> 21b; <em>M.B.</em> 8;            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 9:1-3; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:43-45.

            See <em>Shabbat</em> 22a; <em>Birur Halachah</em>, ibid.; S.A. 674:1. There are different opinions and many details regarding this issue, but the
            [prevalent] custom is not to light even one mitzvah candle from another, as the Rama, Mishnah Berurah, and Kaf HaChayim (8) write. In emergency
            situations, one may rely on the more lenient opinion. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:39.

            <em>S.A.</em>
            672:2, <em>M.B.</em> 7-8. We take into account the opinions of both the Maharshal, who is concerned that onlookers will think that he is
            benefitting from forbidden goods, and the Bach, who permits one to derive benefit from the candles only if he stipulates that the sanctity will not
            rest upon the leftovers after half-an-hour. Also, see below, 13.4, [where I explain] that it is preferable nowadays to light the candles for more
            than half-an-hour. Based on these ideas, I wrote simply that the remaining oil is forbidden, without differentiating between whether the candles
            already burned for half-an-hour or not. However, if one intends on extinguishing the flames after thirty minutes and use the leftovers for mundane
purposes, he may do so, as the Mishnah Berurah explains (677:18). See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:33; <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 9:4;            <em>Yemei HaChanukah</em> 5:11-12.

Regarding the <em>shamash</em>, see <em>Shabbat</em> 21b with <em>Beirur Halachah</em> and <em>S.A.</em> 671:5 with <em>B.H.</em> s.v.<em>ve-tzarich</em>, which indicate that it is worthwhile to distinguish between mitzvah candles and optional ones. Also see            <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:49.

        <p dir="LTR">
            According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, including Shulchan Aruch and Rama (673:1), a single <em>shamash</em> permits one to use the light of
            all of the candles. However, some say that it is forbidden [to use the light of the menorah] if one wants to actually look [at something] closely,
            because he is benefitting from the additional light generated by the mitzvah candles. The author of <em>Pri Chadash</em> holds that it is forbidden
            only if one needs a lot of light. The Mishnah Berurah (673:15) rules – based on the Magen Avraham – that one should ideally not use the light of
the candles and the <em>shamash</em> [at all], because onlookers will think that he lit them for his own purposes. Also see <em>M.B.</em> 24,            <em>B.H.</em> s.v. <em>she-im</em> and <em>yihiyeh</em>, <em>K.H.C.</em> 39, <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:53, <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 9:7.

This custom is cited in <em>S.A.</em> 676:5, <em>Darkei Moshe</em> 2, <em>Sha’ar HaKavanot</em> of the Ari, <em>K.H.C.</em> 31. [The            <em>halachah</em> of] standing next to the new candle, which is on the left, is stated explicitly in <em>C.A.</em> 154 and <em>M.B.</em> 11. I
            would add that by standing to the left of the candles, the lighter avoids being considered as one who turns to the left when lighting the first,
            leftmost candle, because he is simply lighting the candle closest to him; and from there, he turns rightward. There are two additional practices:
            1) The Maharshal and the Gra hold that one should first light the candle closest to the doorpost (whether one placed the menorah to the left of the
            doorway, as the <em>halachah</em> ideally requires, or to its right) and continue lighting the rest from there. [They believe that] one should
start with this candle because it is the one that fulfills the main requirement of the mitzvah, the rest being for the more meticulous (            <em>mehadrin</em>). This, [in their opinion], is more important than lighting from left to right. 2) The Taz’s opinion is the inverse of the
            accepted opinion. He holds that turning to the right means that one begins to light on the right side and continues leftward. [According to him],
            one lights the leftmost candle on the first night, because it is the closest to the left doorpost. [The Chafetz Chayim] elaborates on these
opinions in <em>M.B.</em> and <em>B.H.</em> (ibid.) and writes that one fulfills his obligation no matter which way he lights. See also            <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 6:35 and <em>Yemei HaChanukah</em> 6:19.

            The main explanation the <em>Rishonim</em> give for lighting in the synagogue is to publicize the miracle; [see] Meiri (<em>Shabbat</em> 23b),
            Manhig, Kol Bo, and many others. Rivash (111) writes that when the Jews began lighting indoors, they introduced the custom of lighting in the
            synagogue, in order to publicize the miracle in public. The Manhig gives an additional reason: since the miracle occurred in the Temple, the Rabbis
            wanted to publicize it in synagogue, which is considered a miniature Temple. According to these explanations, one does not fulfill his obligation
            by way of this lighting. The author of <em>Orchot Chayim</em>, however, explains that the custom is also designed to absolve those who do not know
            [how to perform the mitzvah], or are not diligent about it, of their obligation. Some say that [the purpose of this custom] is to enable guests,
            who do not have homes [in the area], to fulfill the mitzvah. According to these explanations, it would seem that one can fulfill his obligation,
            under pressing circumstances, through the synagogue lighting. Rashi, Rambam, and Mordechai – cited above in note 5 – hold that one whose relative
            lit on his behalf, in his absence, is absolved of his obligation to light but not his obligation to thank [God for the miracle]. According to this
            opinion, one may fulfill his obligation [to give thanks] by hearing the blessing of “Who has done miracles” in the synagogue.

        <p dir="LTR">
            Nevertheless, the <em>halachah</em> follows those who explain that the purpose of the synagogue lighting is to publicize the miracle. Therefore,
            one who lights there does not fulfill his obligation, because the [true] obligation is to light at home. When one lights for a wife and children
            [after having said the blessings in synagogue], it is obvious that he must recite all of the blessings at home. However, one who lives alone should
            recite only two blessings on the first night, because there are those who maintain that the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing pertains to the day
            itself (see <em>B.Y.</em> 676:3, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 3), and he has already discharged his obligation with the blessing that he recited in
            synagogue. This ruling is written in <em>M.B.</em> 671:45 and <em>K.H.C.</em> 74. (The author of <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em>, 2:77, writes that such a
            person should also refrain from repeating the blessing of “Who has done miracles.” The author of <em>Iggrot Moshe</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 1:190, writes
            that he should even repeat <em>SheHechiyanu</em>.) It is, therefore, preferable – <em>le’chatchilah</em> – for someone who is free of all these
            doubts to light the synagogue candles, like someone whose custom is to let his father light for him at home.

            <em>Responsa Rav Pa’alim</em>
            (<em>O.C.</em> 2:62) states that if there are ten people, together with the women in the women’s section, it is permissible to recite the
            blessings, even according to those who require ten. <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (7:8) cites opinions that allow children to be counted [as well],
            adding that it is preferable in such a case to ask a child to recite the blessings.

            Those who forbid reciting the blessings are: <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 6:65; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 15:30; <em>Divrei Yatziv</em>, <em>O.C.</em>
286; <em>Sheivet HaLevi</em> 4:65; Rabbi Elyashiv; and Rabbi Auerbach. On the other hand, R. Eliyahu permits it, on condition that they pray            <em>Ma’ariv</em> there, and R. Yisraeli allows it even if they do not pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> (<em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em>, Harari, chap. 10, n. 24).
            [R. Ovadya Yosef] writes likewise in <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (vol. 7, 57:6), adding that R. Ya’akov Rosenthal concurs in <em>Mishnat Ya’akov</em>. The
            author of <em>Az Nidbaru</em> (5:37, 6:75) rules that a blessing should be recited when the lighting takes place outdoors.

        <p dir="LTR">
            The reason I said it is preferable to ask a non-observant Jew to light the candles is that even if the <em>halachah</em> follows the stricter
opinion, we can view his blessing as if it is for educational purposes, similar to why we accustom minors to recite blessings. (See <em>S.A.</em>,            <em>O.C.</em> 215:3, <em>M.B.</em> 14, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 14. It would seem that [pronouncing God’s name] while saying [the formula of] a
            blessing [as it appears] in the Talmud is worse than a secular Jew getting accustomed to making blessings.)
