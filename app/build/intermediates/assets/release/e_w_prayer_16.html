            1. Women with Regard to the Mitzva of <em>Keri’at Shema</em> and
            Its <em>Berakhot</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is a positive biblical commandment to recite <em>Shema</em> at night
        and in the morning, as it is written: "And you shall speak them…when
        you lie down and when you rise" (Devarim 6:7). "When you lie down"
        means at night, and "when you rise" refers to morning. Since it is a
        positive time-bound commandment, men are obligated and women are
        exempt.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages ordained that three <em>berakhot </em>are recited together
        with the morning recitation of <em>Shema</em>, two <em>berakhot </em>
before <em>Shema </em>and one after. They also ordained that four        <em>berakhot</em> are recited along with the evening <em>Shema</em> –
two before and two after (<em>m. Berakhot </em>1:4). These<em>berakhot</em> complement and supplement the themes of the        <em>Shema</em>, and they praise and thank God for creating and
governing the world. Women are also exempt from reciting these<em>berakhot</em>, since they too are time-dependent:        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> of <em>Shaĥarit</em> can only be recited
until the end of the first four hours of the day, and of        <em>Ma’ariv </em>can be recited all night.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that women must mention the Exodus daily
        and nightly because the mitzva is continuous and not time-bound.
        However, as explained below (section 3), most <em>poskim</em> maintain
        that since the daytime and nighttime commemoration of the Exodus are
        distinct, the mitzva is considered time-bound, and women are exempt
        from it (<em>Sha’agat Aryeh</em> §13; MB 70:2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Although women are exempt from reciting <em>Shema</em>, they are still
        obligated in the mitzva of <em>emuna</em> (faith in God), and therefore
        it is proper that they accept the yoke of heaven daily by reciting the
        two verses "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" and "<em>Barukh Shem</em>" (SA
        70:1; MB 5; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 5). One who wishes to enhance the
mitzva recites all three paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> as well as        <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em>, which mentions the Exodus and adjoins
redemption to prayer (see above, ch. 8 n. 4, where it states that<em>Emet Ve-yatziv </em>takes priority over the three paragraphs of the        <em>Shema</em>).<em></em>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Another two time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> are mentioned in <em>Shema</em>
        – <em>tzitzit</em> and <em>tefillin</em>. We already learned (in
        chapter 3) that women absorb the light of time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>
        even without performing them; however a woman who wishes to fulfill a
        time-bound mitzva receives credit for doing so. For various reasons,
women customarily do not fulfill the <em>mitzvot</em> of        <em>tzitzit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> (Rema 17:2 and 38:3; below
21:5-6). However, every woman recites <em>Shema</em> and its        <em>berakhot</em> sometimes, and some even do so daily. This is the
        practice in many schools as well (see above, 2:8 n. 10; 8:3 n. 4).
Therefore, in the ensuing sections we will study the meaning and        <em>halakhot </em>of this mitzva.

            2. The Mitzva of Reciting the <em>Shema</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The recitation of <em>Shema</em> includes three paragraphs. The first
        is "<em>Shema</em>" ("Listen"; Devarim 6:4-9), in which we accept the
        yoke of heaven and which discusses God’s unity and our love for Him.
        The second is "<em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em>" ("And if you follow";
Devarim 11:13-21), which contains the acceptance of the yoke of the        <em>mitzvot</em>. The third is "<em>Va-yomer</em>" ("And He said";
Bamidbar 15:37-41), within which there is a command to remember the        <em>mitzvot</em> via the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>, and at the end of
        which the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The<em> </em>Sages arranged the <em>Shema</em> paragraph to precede        <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em> so that one will first accept the yoke of
        heaven and only then accept the yoke of the <em>mitzvot</em>. They also
        placed <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em>, which presents a general command to
        keep all the <em>mitzvot</em>, including those performed during the day
        and those at night, before <em>Va-yomer</em>, which discusses the
mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>, performed only during the day (        <em>Berakhot</em> 13a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        According to most Rishonim, the biblical commandment can be fulfilled
        by reciting just the "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" verse, for about that
        verse Torah says (Devarim 6:6-7), "These words I am commanding you
        today must be in your heart…when you lie down and when you get up."
        However, the Sages ordained the recitation of all three paragraphs. It
can therefore be explained that the essence of the mitzva of        <em>Shema</em> is indeed the acceptance of the yoke of heaven, which is
        why most Rishonim maintain that even one who only recites the first
        verse fulfills the biblical commandment. Yet, the more one enhances his
        acceptance of the yoke of heaven, the more completely he fulfills the
        biblical mitzva. Therefore, the Sages ordained the recitation of all
        three paragraphs, for within them are the fundamentals of faith, the
        acceptance of the yoke of the <em>mitzvot</em>, and the remembrance of
        all the <em>mitzvot</em> through the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>. Hence,
        in truth, we fulfill the biblical mitzva by reciting all three
        paragraphs (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 15 n. 1).

        <a name="_Toc402175281">3. Remembering the Exodus</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is a biblical commandment to remember the Exodus every day, as the
        Torah says: "So that you remember the day you left Egypt every day of
your life" (Devarim 16:3). The Torah seems to add a superfluous word ("        <em>kol yemei ĥayekha</em>" instead of just "<em>yemei ĥayekha</em>"),
        from which the Sages derive that the mitzva to remember the Exodus is
        performed both during the day and at night (<em>Berakhot</em> 12b).
        This mitzva can be fulfilled by reciting any verse that discusses
        leaving Egypt or by mentioning the Exodus in one’s own words.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There are two reasons why the <em>Va-yomer</em> paragraph was
        incorporated into the recitation of the <em>Shema</em>. First, it
mentions the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em> that reminds us of all the        <em>mitzvot</em>. Second, it discusses the Exodus from Egypt. It is
        therefore customary to say <em>Va-yomer</em> even at night, for
        although there is no need to mention the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>
        then, there is still reason to say it for the sake of remembering the
Exodus (see <em>Berakhot</em> 14b, and <em>Kessef Mishneh</em>, Laws of        <em>Keri’at Shema</em> 1:2-3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
There is a difference between the mitzva of <em>Keri’at</em>        <em>Shema</em> and the mitzva of remembering the Exodus from Egypt. The
        mitzva of <em>Keri’at</em> <em>Shema</em> can only be fulfilled in the
        first three hours of the day because that is the time we wake up,
        whereas the daytime mitzva of remembering the Exodus can be performed
        throughout the entire day. However, following the enactment of the
Sages, we fulfill the mitzva of remembering the Exodus by saying        <em>Shema</em>. The Exodus is also mentioned in the <em>berakhot</em>
of <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> in <em>Shaĥarit</em> and        <em>Emet Ve-emuna</em> in <em>Ma’ariv</em>, and one who recites them
        fulfills his obligation of remembering the Exodus even if he did not
        recite the <em>Shema</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Regarding women, some <em>poskim</em> say that since the mitzva to
        remember the Exodus from Egypt lasts continuously throughout the day
        and night, it is not a time-bound mitzva, and women are therefore
obligated to fulfill it. Hence, women are required to recite        <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> in <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Emet Ve-emuna</em>
in <em>Ma’ariv</em> (MA). Still, according to the majority of        <em>poskim</em>, because there is a specific mitzva to remember during
        the day and a specific mitzva to remember at night, it is considered a
        time-bound mitzva from which women are exempt (<em>Sha’agat Aryeh</em>
        §13; MB 70:2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Nonetheless, a woman who wishes to perform this mitzva is praiseworthy.
It is preferable for her to fulfill this mitzva by reciting        <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em>, because <em>Va-yomer</em> mentions the mitzva
of <em>tzitzit</em>, from which women are exempt, whereas        <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em>, which discusses the redemption of Israel,
pertains to both men and women. Moreover, if she recites this        <em>berakha</em> followed immediately by the <em>Amida</em>, she will
        have fulfilled the enhancement of juxtaposing redemption and prayer
        (see below, section 13).

            4. The Content of the <em>Shema</em> Paragraph
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The <em>Shema</em> paragraph (Devarim 6:4-9) consists of three
        sections: 1) the principle of faith; 2) the meaning of this principle
        in our lives; 3) guidance on imbuing our lives with faith.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        1) The first verse, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One,"
        teaches the core principle of Jewish monotheistic faith: that God is
        Master of all and there is no power in the world other than Him. Even
        though it may seem to us that there are other distinct powers, in truth
        God is the One and Only, Who sustains all. There is none but Him.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        2) This belief bears great significance on our lives. It implies that
        there is no value in this world outside adherence to God, and we are
        thus enjoined to love Him "with all your heart, with all your soul, and
        with all your might." The Sages (<em>Berakhot</em> 54a) interpret these
        words: "‘With all your heart’ – with both of your inclinations: your
        good inclination and your evil inclination," because one’s evil
        inclination must be controlled to serve God, whether by force or by
        transforming it into good; "‘And with all your soul’ – even if it takes
        your life," for one must be ready to give his life for his belief in
        God; "‘And with all your might’ (‘<em>me’odekha</em>’) – with all your
        money (‘<em>mamonekha</em>’)" – even one’s money should serve as a
        basis and a means to serve God, so that if it were demanded of a Jew to
        violate his religion or lose all his wealth, he would forfeit his money
        rather than defy his belief. Alternatively, they interpret, "‘With all
your might’ – no matter what He metes out to you (‘        <em>be-khol mida u-mida she-Hu moded lekha</em>’), be very grateful to
        him."
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        3) In the third part of this paragraph, the Torah offers guidance for
        incorporating these principles of faith. First, "These words that I
        command you today shall be upon your heart," and then, "teach them to
        your children." Even after one learns the basics of faith very well, if
        he does not repeat them to himself every day, the worries of his life
        and his dealings can cause him to forget them. Therefore we are
        commanded, "And you shall speak them when you sit at home, when you
        walk on your way, when you lie down, and when you rise." From here we
        derive the obligation to recite <em>Shema</em> both in the morning and
        at night. Nevertheless, the Torah is not content with recitation alone;
it adds the mitzva to place these paragraphs on faith into our        <em>tefillin</em> and to bind them to our arms and heads: "You shall
        bind them as a sign on your arm and they should be a symbol between
your eyes." We are moreover commanded to fix them firmly in the        <em>mezuzot</em> on our doorposts, as it is written, "write them on the
        doorposts (<em>mezuzot</em>) of your homes and your gates." This is so
that every time we enter and exit our homes, we notice the        <em>mezuza</em> and recall the fundamentals of Jewish faith.
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175283">5. The Second and Third Paragraphs</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In the second paragraph, "<em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em>" (Devarim
        11:13-21), we learn the value of the <em>mitzvot</em>, the reward for
        those who fulfill them, and the punishment for those who transgress
them. If we love God, serve Him with all our hearts, and fulfill His        <em>mitzvot</em>, we will be worthy of His blessing. The land will
        bring forth its crops, and we and our children will live long lives on
        the soil that God promised to give to our ancestors and to us. However,
        if we, God forbid, stray from the path, God will be angry with us, the
        ground will not yield its produce, and we will perish from upon the
        good land. The Torah goes on to reiterate the commandment to
contemplate the fundamentals, to place this paragraph in the<em>tefillin</em> on our arms and our heads, and to post        <em>mezuzot</em> on the entrances to our homes. Thus, whereas the first
        paragraph emphasizes our turn toward God, the second paragraph
        emphasizes the manifestation of God’s actions in the world, as the
        fulfillment of the <em>mitzvot</em> is an expression of God’s word in
        this world while reward and punishment confirm His supervision of the
        world.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In the third paragraph, "<em>Va-yomer</em>" (Bamidbar 15:37-41), the
        mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em> is elucidated. This mitzva has the unique
        ability to remind us of all the <em>mitzvot</em> and inspire their
        fulfillment, as it is stated: "Remember all of God’s <em>mitzvot</em> –
        do them." Indeed, the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em> is only performed
        during the day and not at night because the day symbolizes the clear
revelation of God’s word in the world. By revealing the light of the        <em>mitzvot</em> and remembering them, we have the strength to overcome
        our inclination, as the Torah states: "You will not stray after your
        heart and after your eyes that you chase after." The conclusion of the
        paragraph mentions the Exodus. Just as <em>tzitzit</em> reveal the
        light of all the <em>mitzvot</em>, so too, the Exodus demonstrates that
        this world has a Sovereign and that the Jewish people were chosen to
        reveal His word.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Thus, each of the three paragraphs is a continuation of and an
expansion of the basis of faith contained in the verse "        <em>Shema Yisrael</em>." In the first paragraph, we learn the essential
        significance of faith as the one and only foundation of our lives. This
is an extension of the words "<strong><em>Hashem Eĥad</em></strong>" ("        <strong>God is One</strong>"). From that, we accept upon ourselves the
        yoke of all the <em>mitzvot</em> in the second paragraph, which is an
extension of the words "<strong><em>Hashem Elokeinu</em></strong>" ("        <strong>the Lord is our God</strong>"). In the third paragraph, the
        mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em> reminds us of all the <em>mitzvot</em>. At
        the end, it talks about the Exodus, which showed the world that God
        chose Israel and that He oversees and rules the world. This is an
expansion of the words, "<strong><em>Shema</em> <em>Yisrael</em></strong>" ("        <strong>Hear O Israel</strong>"). Later in this chapter (section 12) we
        will learn that the <em>berakhot</em> instituted by the Sages also
        continue and supplement the <em>Shema</em>.

    <a name="6"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175284">6. The Significance of the Exodus</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Egyptian kingdom, which enslaved Israel, was essentially a material
        one. Historical research corroborates this. Among all the ancient
        nations, no culture was more materialistic than the Egyptian culture.
        The Egyptians denied the existence of a soul and did not believe in the
        afterlife. Only the human body and material objects were of importance
        to them. They therefore invested enormous effort into embalming and
        mummifying their dead. Even the great pyramids are nothing but tombs
        for their bodies. Their moral culture correspondingly was concerned
        primarily with satisfying bodily appetites. As the Sages tell us, no
nation was as awash in lust as the Egyptians (<em>Torat Kohanim</em>,        <em>Aĥarei Mot </em>9). The Jewish people represent the exact opposite;
        their aspirations are primarily spiritual.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        During that difficult period, the materialistic Egyptian people ruled
        over the people of Israel, enslaved them, and subjected them to
        excruciating physical labor. It seemed that the great spirit that our
        patriarchs began to display would never rise again. The material had
        prevailed over the spiritual. Until the King of kings appeared in all
        His glory and brought us forth from Egypt.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        By taking us out of Egypt, God showed the world, for the first time,
        the full power of the spirit. It was then made known that the world is
        not merely physical urges, but also spirit; spirit and soul exist, as
        do moral values. The Exodus expresses the victory of spirit over
        matter. It demonstrates that even if matter tries its best to enslave
        the spirit, the spirit ultimately breaks free from its chains. Just as
        God smote Egypt and brought Israel out with great wealth, so every
        battle between spirit and matter will end with spirit victorious.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Just as the Jewish people, who gave the world Torah and ethics, were
        liberated from the bonds of Egyptian materialism, so too each
        individual Jew must free herself from the bonds of materialism,
discover the spirit, and connect with the Almighty through        <em>mitzvot</em>. By fulfilling the mitzva of remembering the Exodus,
        we recall the uniqueness and destiny of Israel, thereby freeing
        ourselves from the bonds of the material and disclosing the eternal
        divine truth (see <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Pesaĥ</em>, 1:2-4).

            7. <em>Kavana</em> While Reciting the First Verse
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One’s primary <em>kavana </em>must be for the first verse, because in
        saying it we accept the yoke of heaven, as the Torah says: "These
        words… must be in your heart" (Devarim 6:6). Therefore, one must
        concentrate in her heart on the words she recites in the first verse.
        If she did not focus on the words she recited, she did not perform the
        mitzva (<em>Berakhot</em> 13b; SA 60:5, 63:4). Even one who
        concentrates on the full meaning of every word must try not to think
about other things while reciting the verse. However,        <em>be-di’avad</em>, it seems that as long as she also pondered the
meaning of the verse, she fulfilled the mitzva (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 15 n. 2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
This is the meaning on which one should focus: "        <strong><em>Shema Yisrael</em></strong>" – "Hear O Israel"; the mitzva
        to accept God’s yoke is intended for the Jewish people, the nation
whose purpose is to express faith in God’s singularity in the world. "        <strong><em>Hashem</em></strong>" – "the Lord"; this word is not
        pronounced as written. It is written as the Tetragrammaton, God’s
        four-letter proper name, but it is pronounced "<em>Adonai</em>." While
        reciting it, one should focus on the meaning of the word as pronounced
        – that He is Master of all – as well as the word as written – that He
        is eternal. "<strong><em>Elokeinu</em></strong>" – "our God"; He is
powerful, omnipotent, the master of all forces, Who rules over us. "        <strong><em>Eĥad</em></strong>" – "one"; a person should prolong the
        recitation of this word long enough to have <em>kavana</em> that God is
        the sole ruler of the whole world, heaven and earth and the four
        directions of the world. This meaning is hinted at in the numerical
values of the letters of the word: <em>alef</em> – one: God is One; "        <em>ĥet</em>"<em> </em>–<em> </em>eight: God rules over the seven
        heavens and the earth; "<em>dalet</em>"<em> </em>– four: God rules over
        the four directions (SA 61:6; and see MB<em> </em>18).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Be-di’avad</em>
        , even if one does not focus on the exact meaning of each word and name
        but understands their meaning generally – that they are about the
acceptance of the yoke of heaven – she fulfills this mitzva (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 15 n. 3). However, if her mind
        wanders and she does not concentrate on even the general meaning of the
        words of the first verse, she does not fulfill the mitzva and must
repeat the first verse with <em>kavana</em> in order to do so (MB<em> </em>63:14; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 17-18; see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 15:6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
It is customary to recite the first verse aloud in order to inspire        <em>kavana</em>, it is customary to read the first verse out loud. It
        is also customary to cover the eyes with the right hand so as to avoid
        looking at anything else that might disrupt concentration (SA 61:4-5;
        MB 17).

        <a name="_Toc402175286">8. The Second Verse and its Meaning</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Immediately following the first verse, we say quietly, "        <em>Barukh Shem kevod malkhuto le-olam va-ed</em>" ("Blessed is the
        name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity"). Although this passage
        does not appear in the <em>Shema</em> paragraph and is not a verse from
        Tanakh, the Sages ordained its recitation as part of <em>Shema</em>
        based on an ancient tradition.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Talmud (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 56a) recounts that before the patriarch
        Yaakov died, all of his sons gathered around him. He wished to disclose
        the end of days, but at that moment the <em>Shekhina</em> left him and
        he could not tell them. He asked his sons, "Perhaps one of you is not
        righteous, like Yishmael who came from Avraham and Esav who came from
        my father Yitzĥak, and that is preventing me from disclosing the end of
        days to you?" They all replied as one: "‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our
        God, the Lord is One.’ Just like there is only One in your heart, there
is only One in our hearts." At that moment, Yaakov said, "        <em>Barukh Shem kevod malkhuto le-olam va-ed</em>." The Sages ask,
        "What should we do? Should we recite this sentence even though it is
        not written in the Torah? Should we omit it even though Yaakov said
        it?" Therefore they ordained that it is recited quietly.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        This sentence is considered a continuation of the acceptance of the
        yoke of heaven found in the first verse, and therefore also requires
        that one concentrate on the meaning of the words (MB 63:12). As we
learned, it is proper for women to recite the first two verses of        <em>Shema</em> daily.<em></em>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
One should pause briefly between "<em>le-olam va’ed</em>" and "        <em>Ve-ahavta</em>" ("You shall love") in order to distinguish between
        the acceptance of the yoke of heaven and the rest of the paragraph.
Also, it is proper to pause between the first verse and "        <em>Barukh shem</em>" to differentiate between the acceptance of the
        yoke of heaven as commanded by the Torah and the enactment of the Sages
        (SA and Rema 61:14).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Although God’s unity is extremely profound concept, we will nonetheless
briefly discuss its meaning. The first verse, <em>Shema</em>        <em>Yisrael</em>, expresses the greatest, most absolute, most unified
        form of belief and is called "<em>yiĥud elyon</em>" (the higher
        unification). In this conception, nothing other than God has any real
        existence; rather He is alone, and we are all non-existent in relation
        to Him. Since God’s omnipotence is not revealed in this world, it is
        difficult to grasp the higher unification on a permanent basis. But
        twice daily, when we recite <em>Shema</em> <em>Yisrael</em>, we are
commanded to rise to this level. The second verse is called "        <em>yiĥud taĥton</em>" (the lower unification). By reciting it, we
        accept upon ourselves the yoke of heaven according to the level of
        belief that remains paramount in this world: the belief that the world
        really, tangibly exists and God gives it life and rules over it. By His
        will He adds life to it, or heaven forbid, takes life away from it.
        This is the meaning of the statement that His name and sovereignty are
revealed in this world, as we say, "Blessed is the        <strong>name</strong> of His glorious <strong>kingdom</strong> for all
eternity" (<em>Tanya</em>,<em> Sha’ar Ha-yiĥud Ve-ha-emuna</em>;        <em>Nefesh Ha-ĥayim</em>, part 3).

        <a name="_Toc402175287">9. The Laws of Reciting <em>Shema</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must recite <em>Shema</em> with great <em>kavana</em>, with fear,
        awe, trembling, and sweat; she should contemplate in her heart that she
        is now reciting God’s word and focus on its meaning, as if they were
        new to her (SA<em> </em>61:1-2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
In addition to <em>kavana</em>, one must pronounce the words of        <em>Shema </em>precisely, taking care not to slur any letter, harden
        soft sounds, or soften hard ones. Therefore, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, one
should distinguish between an <em>alef</em> and an <em>ayin</em>, a<em>khaf</em> and a <em>ĥet</em>, a <em>kamatz</em> and a        <em>pataĥ</em>, and a <em>tzeirei</em> and a <em>segol</em> (SA
        61:14-23). The Sages say, "If one recites <em>Shema</em> and is careful
to pronounce its letters exactly, Hell is cooled for him" (<em>Berakhot</em> 15b). <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if she did not recite        <em>Shema</em> meticulously, she nevertheless fulfilled her obligation
        as long as she did not miss a word or a full syllable (SA 62:1; MB 1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must hear what she is saying. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if she read the
        words only with her lips but did not hear herself, since she mouthed
the words, she fulfilled her obligation. However, one who only recited        <em>Shema</em> in her mind, without mouthing the words, did not fulfill
        her obligation (SA 62:3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Technically, one fulfills the mitzva by reciting <em>Shema </em>or the        <em>Amida </em>in any language she understands, though it is proper to
        recite them in Hebrew (see above, 1:10). However, several major
        Aĥaronim write that nowadays one cannot fulfill the obligation by
        reciting <em>Shema</em> in a different language, because there are
        words that cannot be translated accurately. For example, the Hebrew
word "<em>ve-shinantam</em>" ("teach them") connotes both repetition (        <em>shinun</em>) and sharpening (<em>ĥidud</em>). No foreign word
        captures exactly these meanings. Since the <em>Shema</em> cannot be
        translated precisely, there is no option to recite it in a different
        language (MB 62:3; see also <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 15 n.
        7).

        <a name="_Toc402175288">10. The Way to Recite <em>Shema</em></a>
        <em> </em>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One may recite <em>Shema</em> while standing, sitting, or lying down on
        one’s side (<em>Berakhot</em> 10a; SA 63:1). We learn from this rule
        that faith is not something detached from this world, something that
        can only be achieved under specific circumstances. Rather, the faith
        expressed in the recitation of <em>Shema</em> is a part of every life
        situation in this world, and so one may recite <em>Shema</em> in any
        situation.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Technically, one may recite <em>Shema</em> even while walking, as the
        Torah says, "when you walk on your way." However, the Sages maintain
        that it is not proper for one to accept the yoke of heaven casually.
        Therefore, one who is walking should stand still while reciting first
        verse of <em>Shema</em> (SA 63:3; MB 9).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Because of the importance of the first paragraph, in which we accept
        the yoke of heaven, one must be careful not to occupy herself with
        anything else while saying it, nor gesture with her eyes, fingers, or
        lips (SA 63:6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is worth noting that <em>mitzvot</em> require <em>kavana</em> (SA
        60:4). That is, in addition to the actual performance of the mitzva,
        one must also intend this action or speech-act to be a mitzva; just as
        one has a body and a soul and one cannot live without the other, so
        too, the <em>mitzvot</em> have both body and soul. The act is the body
        and the accompanying intent is the soul.

        <a name="_Toc402175289">11. 248 Words</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Torah gives life and health to the world and to humanity. This is
        especially true of <em>Shema</em>, which contains the principles of
faith and the fulfillment of the <em>mitzvot</em>. The Sages teach that        <em>Shema</em> is comprised of 248 words, just as there are 248 limbs
        in the human body; when one recites <em>Shema</em> properly, each and
        every limb corresponds to one word and is healed by it. However, in the
        three paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> there are actually 245 words. In
order to reach 248, the <em>ĥazan</em> repeats the last three words, "        <em>Hashem Elokeikhem emet</em>" ("the Lord, your God, is true"),
        thereby completing the count to 248 (<em>Zohar Ĥadash Ruth</em> 95:1;
        see also <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 15:12).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Women, who do not pray in the synagogue, do not hear the <em>ĥazan</em>
        , and therefore must practice one would when praying individually. That
        is, according to Ashkenazic custom, before beginning <em>Shema</em> she
        says, "<em>Kel Melekh ne’eman</em>" ("God, faithful King"). Even though
women have 252 limbs, as the womb has two doors and two hinges (        <em>Bekhorot </em>45a), since all people have 248 limbs, perhaps it is
        most important to direct the blessings toward them, and the blessing
will then continue to the limbs unique to women (        <em>Minĥat Elazar </em>2:28; <em>Ha-elef Lekha Shlomo </em>OĤ 120).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        According to Sephardic custom, one praying individually should also
complete the three missing words on her own and repeat "<em>Hashem</em>        <em>Elokeikhem</em> <em>emet</em>" (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 61:15-16).
Some say that according to Sephardic custom a woman should say "<em>Kel Melekh Ne’eman</em>" before and also repeat "        <em>Hashem Elokeikhem emet</em>" after <em>Shema</em>, thereby reaching
        252 words, matching the number of her limbs (<em>She’eirit Yosef </em>
        vol. 2, p. 186).

12. The <em>Berakhot</em> Are an Extension of            <em>Keri’at Shema</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>
are unlike other <em>birkhot ha-mitzvot</em> instituted as preparation<em>mitzvot</em>, which contain the formula "        <em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu</em>…" (Who has sanctified
        us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us…"). Rather, they are
        formulated as praise, thanksgiving, and some petition, and their
        purpose is to express more expansively the themes of <em>Shema</em>,
        whose essence is the first verse.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In the <em>Shema</em> we say "<em>Hashem Eĥad</em>" ("God is One"),
        denoting that He is the single entity that brings the world into being
and sustains it and that there is none other than Him. In the first        <em>berakha</em> of <em>Keri’at Shema</em>, we expand on this
        principle, and by praising Him for the light that is renewed daily, we
        continue to extol God, "Who constantly renews the work of Creation
        every day." To emphasize His oneness, we praise Him as Creator of both
        light and darkness. At night, in the corresponding <em>berakha</em>, we
        praise him as "<em>Ma’ariv aravim</em>" ("the One Who brings on
        evening") and add that He is "<em>Borei yom va-laila</em>" ("the
        Creator of day and night"). Hence, the principle of belief in God’s
unity that appears in <em>Shema </em>is amplified in the first        <em>berakha</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The significance of the opening words, "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>," is
        that the belief in God’s unity is revealed to the world through the
        Jewish people, who were put in the world for that purpose. This idea is
        amplified in the second <em>berakha</em>, in which we thank God for
        loving us and for giving us the Torah out of love. We pray for the
        opportunity to understand the Torah and fulfilling it with love,
        thereby revealing God’s name in the world.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        "<em>Hashem Elokeinu</em>" ("Lord our God") means that God is
        omnipotent and rules the world according to His will. His control of
        the world, with all its forces and components, was revealed most
        clearly in the Exodus, which is mentioned at the end of the third
        paragraph of <em>Shema</em>. In the third <em>berakha</em> we expand on
        this further and praise God, "You are the first and You are the last,
        and aside from You we have no king, redeemer, or savior. You redeemed
        us from Egypt…" We also mention the slaying of the Egyptian firstborns
        and the splitting of the sea. We conclude, "Blessed are You, Lord, Who
        redeemed Israel" ("<em>Ga’al Yisrael</em>").
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        We thus see that all three <em>berakhot</em> are a continuation and
        expansion of the principles of faith that are found in <em>Shema</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Because these <em>berakhot</em> are unlike others which we recite
        before the performance of <em>mitzvot</em>, confusing their sequence
does not prevent fulfillment of the mitzva. Although certainly        <em>le-khatĥila</em> they must be recited in the order that the Sages
        ordained, <em>be-di’avad</em>, if one changed the order, she still
        fulfills the mitzva. Likewise, if she recited the <em>berakhot</em>
without reciting<em> Shema</em>, or if she only recited one of the<em>berakhot</em>, she is credited for what she recited (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 16 n. 1).

            13. The Laws of Reciting the <em>Berakhot</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
A woman who recites <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> must be careful not to interrupt by
        speaking between them. Since <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> serves as a
        preparation for prayer, she must take care not to interrupt from the
beginning of <em>Barukh She-amar </em>until the end of the        <em>Amida</em> (SA 54:3).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In <em>Yotzer Or</em>, we recite verses of <em>Kedusha</em>, and
although it is forbidden to say <em>Kedusha</em> without a<em>minyan</em>, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, the<em>Kedusha</em> in <em>Yotzer Or </em>does not require a        <em>minyan</em> for it is not our intention to sanctify God as
        individuals at that time; rather, the verses are a description of how
        angels sanctify God’s Name (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>, Rosh).
        However, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, in order to fulfill her obligation
according to all <em>poskim</em>, it is best that a woman who recites        <em>Yotzer Or</em> without a <em>minyan</em> says them in the ritual
        chant for verses of Tanakh, for then she is considered to be speaking
them in the manner of one studying, which all agree is permissible (        <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em>,<em> </em>SA 59:3). It is not necessary for
        her to know the precise cantillation melodies; rather, the main idea is
        that she tries to recite the words somewhat like a traditional chant so
        that it appears as if she is studying a book of the Prophets.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Although the recitation of <em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em> and
        the recitation of the <em>Amida</em> are two separate <em>mitzvot</em>,
        a woman who recites them both must adjoin them; immediately upon
        finishing <em>Ga’al Yisrael</em> she must begin the <em>Amida</em>. The
        Sages state that anyone who adjoins redemption to prayer indeed merits
        life in the next world (<em>Berakhot</em> 4b). If one adjoins them
        while praying <em>ke-vatikin </em>(at <em>hanetz ha-ĥama</em>), he is
        promised that he will not be harmed that whole day (<em>Berakhot</em>
        9b and <em>Tosafot</em> <em>ad loc.</em>). One who interrupts between
        redemption and prayer is like a king’s confidant who comes and knocks
        on the king’s door, and when the king emerges to find out what he
        wants, the confidant leaves to take care of another matter, which then
        results in the king’s withdrawal from him.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The mention of Israel’s redemption from Egypt is like the knock on the
        king’s door, because the redemption demonstrates the great love God has
        for Israel. The Exodus is considered God’s betrothal of Israel, as it
        were. It therefore forbidden to waste the opportunity. At this moment
        of closeness, we must achieve devotion through prayer and ask that God
bless and redeem us like He redeemed us from Egypt (see        <em>y. Berakhot </em>1:1).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In order to prevent hatred and insult, the Sages permitted offering
greetings in the middle of reciting <em>Shema</em> and its<em>berakhot</em> to one to whom courtesy demands doing so. The        <em>poskim</em> write that since it is accepted nowadays not to
        interrupt in the middle of prayer, honorable people are not insulted
        when they are not greeted and asked how they are. Therefore, no
        permission is granted to interrupt in the middle of <em>Shema </em>and
        its <em>berakhot</em> in order to address an honorable or revered
        person (MB 66:2, based on <em>Sefer Ha-ĥinukh</em>). However, if
        someone who does not understand the value of prayer approaches the
        woman praying, and if not answering will likely cause insult, it is
        permitted to initiate a greeting. Similarly, a newly religious person
        whose parents do not understand the value of prayer may greet them
succinctly. In the middle of the verses "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" and "        <em>Barukh Shem</em>" one must not interrupt, unless a life is at
        stake.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
One may interrupt by talking in the middle of <em>Shema</em> and its        <em>berakhot</em> in order to save herself from bodily harm or monetary

        or <em>berakha</em> she is reciting before doing so (see BHL 66:1).

the Sages permitted the interruption of <em>Keri’at Shema</em> and its        <em>berakhot</em> for the honor of a human being, one may certainly
        interrupt for God’s honor (Ritva, <em>Kaf Ha-Ĥayim</em> 66:7).
