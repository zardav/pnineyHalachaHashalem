    Chapter Eight: The Customs of the Three Weeks
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>8.1 – The Period of “Between the Straits” </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The three week period between the seventeenth of Tammuz and the ninth of Av is a painful time, about which it says,    <em>All her pursuers overtook her between the straits</em> (<em>Eichah</em> 1:3). Therefore, our Sages recommended that we take extra precautions on these
    days, which are prone to calamity. For example, even though one must always be careful and vigilant, hikers and ocean bathers must be extra careful during
    this period (see <em>Eichah Rabbah</em> 1:29).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to signify the nature of these days, <em>Chazal</em> instituted the reading of special <em>haftarot</em>, dealing with calamity, on the three
    Shabbatot “between the straits.” On the seven Shabbatot following Tish’a B’Av, we read seven <em>haftarot</em> of consolation (<em>S.A.</em> 428:8, based
    on the <em>Pesikta</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though <em>Chazal</em> did not make any special enactments to mark the suffering and mourning of the Three Weeks, a custom developed among the Jewish
    people to refrain from dancing and to avoid saying the <em>Shehechiyanu</em> blessing during this period.

</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are [other] customs of mourning that various communities have adopted. Ashkenazi Jews, along with some Sefardim, including Jews from Morocco and
    Gerba, refrain from taking haircuts during the Three Weeks. All other Sefardim are strict about this only during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls.
    Ashkenazim, Yemenites, and most Sefardim do not make weddings during the Three Weeks. The remaining Sefardim are more lenient, only avoiding weddings from
    the beginning of the month of Av (see below, sec. 7).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the following sections we will discuss at length the customs of the Three Weeks, the Nine Days, and the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>8.2 – Dancing and Music </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Acharonim write that it is forbidden to organize dances from the seventeenth of Tammuz to the ninth of Av (<em>M.A.</em> 551:10). This includes a
    prohibition against playing or listening to music. Therefore it is forbidden to hold or attend dance classes, concerts, and sing-alongs during the Three
    Weeks.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A Jew who makes a living playing music may play at non-Jewish events until the end of Tammuz. Even though he plays joyous music there, it does not make him
    so happy, because he is preoccupied with his work. From the beginning of Av, however, he should not play any music (<em>B.H.</em> 551:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since the reason music is prohibited is because it brings joy, music teachers may continue giving lessons until the week of Tish’a B’Av, because neither
    the teacher nor the students enjoy music lessons. In addition, canceling the lessons will cause the teacher financial loss, and the students will have to
    expend extra effort afterwards to return to their normal studies, possibly even requiring extra classes. It is best to learn sad melodies during the Three
    Weeks (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 16:19). If the teacher and students are, in any event, accustomed to taking a break from their lessons, it is preferable, if
    possible, to schedule the break for the Three Weeks.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>8.3 – Music at a Se’udat Mitzvah </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
It is permissible to sing happy songs at a <em>se’udat </em>mitzvah (a religious meal), like the meal at a <em>brit milah</em> (circumcision),    <em>pidyon ha-ben</em> (redemption of the firstborn son), or <em>sheva berachot</em> (seven blessings said after eating a meal in honor of newlyweds). It
    is also permissible to celebrate a bar- or bat-mitzvah [during this period], as long as the party is held on the actual day the youngster becomes obligated
    in <em>mitzvot</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>poskim</em> debate whether one may hire musicians to play at a <em>se’udat </em>mitzvah during the Three Weeks, in a place where people always hire
    bands for such occasions. Some say that it is permissible since the music is being played for the sake of a mitzvah. Others, however, forbid it. One who
    wants to act leniently has upon whom to rely, as long as this is the custom throughout the year.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, in a place where people always hire musicians for bar mitzvah celebrations, it is permissible to so during the Three Weeks. However, if some
    people hire two musicians and others hire three, it is proper to hire only two during the Three Weeks. The same is true of all mitzvah celebrations: we
    follow the custom of the rest of the year.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Once the month of Av arrives, one should not hire musicians for any celebration. Similarly, one should not play joyous songs on an electronic music player.
    The only songs that are permitted are those that relate to the celebration, and only when they are sung vocally. It is even permissible to dance a little
    in a circle, as many people are accustomed to doing at a <em>brit milah</em> celebration.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Bridegrooms who come from communities where they make weddings until the end of Tammuz may hire a regular band for their weddings, because there is no joy
    for a bride and groom without musical instruments. Even those who avoid getting married during these days may attend and dance at these weddings, for they
    are mitzvah celebrations.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>8.4 – Listening to Music on Household, Electronic Devices </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some [authorities] maintain that just as it is forbidden to listen to live music during the Three Weeks, it is also forbidden to listen to music played on
    household, electronic devices, like radios and music players. The only songs that one may listen to during <em>Sefirat HaOmer</em> and the Three Weeks are
those that have no musical accompaniment. This is how several of the greatest <em>poskim</em> rule (<em>Iggrot Moshe</em>, YD 2:137;    <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> 6:34). Some <em>poskim</em> even forbid listening to non-instrumental songs during these periods (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 15:33).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, there are those who permit listening to music on electronic devices, reasoning that the <em>Acharonim</em> only prohibited listening to a live
    musical performance, which entails some degree of festiveness. Listening to musical instruments by way of a radio or music player, on the other hand, is
    not particularly festive. Granted, when they first began manufacturing radios and tape recorders, people [truly] reveled in listening to songs on them.
    Today, however, when everyone listens to music on electronic devices all the time, people do not overly delight in doing so. Therefore, one is allowed to
    listen to them during the Three Weeks.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Furthermore, a distinction can be made between happy songs and regular ones. It is only fitting to prohibit happy songs during the Three Weeks, while
    regular tunes, and certainly sad ones, should be permitted. Similarly, the Gemara (<em>Shabbat</em> 151a) teaches that the custom was to play flutes at a
    funeral in order to arouse people to mourn and cry over the deceased, and this was part of the mitzvah of <em>levayat ha-meit</em>, accompanying the
    deceased to his final resting place. This shows that there is no sweeping prohibition against hearing musical instruments. Rather, it is forbidden to
    listen to happy tunes during times of mourning. I heard from my father and teacher that not only is it permissible to play sad, instrumental songs related
    to the <em>Churban</em> on the radio during the Nine Days, but it is actually good to do so, because it arouses people to mourn the <em>Churban</em> even
    more.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>8.5 – Practical Halachah</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice: it seems, according to the lenient opinion, that we should divide all songs into three categories. 1) Joyous songs, like those played at
    weddings; 2) songs that are neither especially joyous nor especially sad, which includes most contemporary music and most classical compositions; 3) sad
    songs, like those that mourn a person’s death or the destruction of the Temple.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    At the beginning of the Three Weeks, one should refrain from listening to the first category of music – joyous songs. Starting from the first of Av, one
    should cut out the middle category as well, listening only to sad songs, the third category. Arutz Sheva adopted this practice, broadcasting ordinary,
    neutral songs during the Three Weeks and sad songs that remind the listener of the mourning over the Temple, during the Nine Days.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It also seems [to me] that one should not listen to music – even permissible songs – at high volumes, because when someone listens to a song, even a
    neutral one, out loud, the force of the sound makes it more festive and practically transforms it into a joyous song.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Furthermore, it seems to be forbidden to attend a concert featuring sad music (a requiem). Even though the music is sorrowful, concerts are festive and
    joyous events, the proof being that people usually dress up for them. However, it would seem to be permissible to play a sad tune in commemoration of
    Jerusalem at a cultural event, even during the Nine Days (based on <em>Shabbat</em> 151a).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>8.6 – Hikes, Swimming, and Hotel Vacations </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some say that we must refrain from hiking and swimming in the ocean or a pool during the Three Weeks, in order to limit our enjoyment during this period of
    “between the straits.” Furthermore, since these days are prone to calamity, one must avoid potentially dangerous activities.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    From a halachic standpoint, however, these things are permissible. After all, <em>Chazal</em> instruct us to decrease our joy only beginning with Rosh
    Chodesh Av. They do not prohibit doing pleasurable and enjoyable things beforehand. The only thing one should avoid is special celebrations, like parties,
    concerts, and dances. Therefore, one may go hiking, swimming, and stay in a hotel until the end of Tammuz. And regarding the concern about [doing] things
    that are potentially dangerous: we are not dealing with such a [serious] concern for which one needs to avoid outings and the like. Indeed, one must be
    careful of dangerous activities throughout the year, and during this period it is appropriate to take extra precautions.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Once Av arrives, we curtail our joy. Therefore, one must refrain from hikes and recreational activities that are mainly designed to provide pleasure and
    joy. A trip or vacation that is designed primarily for educational or therapeutic purposes may be taken during the Nine Days. The same goes for bathing in
    an ocean or swimming pool: if the objective is to have a good time, it is forbidden. However, if someone’s [doctor] instructs him to swim for health
    reasons, he may do so even during the Nine Days.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>8.7 – Reciting <em>SheHechiyanu</em> during the Three Weeks </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
Some of the greatest <em>Rishonim</em> refrained from eating a new fruit or buying a new garment during the Three Weeks, in order to avoid reciting the    <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing. Their reasoning: how can we say, “[Blessed are You, O Lord…] Who has kept us alive, sustained us, and brought us to this
    time” during a period of [such] misfortune? (<em>Sefer Chasidim</em> 840). Even though some of the greatest <em>poskim</em> felt that one need not be
careful in this regard (Taz, Gra), over time the custom developed to act strictly and avoid reciting the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing during    <em>bein ha-metzarim</em>. Therefore, we are careful not to eat a new fruit that requires the recitation of <em>SheHechiyanu</em> or buy a new garment upon
    which the blessing is said.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, one may purchase items upon which the blessing is not recited, until the end of Tammuz. For example, one may buy socks or undershirts, because
they are not significant enough to warrant the recitation of <em>SheHechiyanu</em>. One may also purchase shoes, because the custom is not to recite    <em>SheHechiyanu</em> over them (<em>S.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 223:6). Similarly, a couple may buy a piece of furniture, because they
    recite the <em>HaTov VeHaMeitiv</em> blessing, since they are partners in the purchase. An individual, on the other hand, must refrain from buying
    furniture, because he or she recites <em>SheHechiyanu</em> (<em>S.A.</em> 223:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is also permissible to buy – until the end of Tammuz – a distinguished garment that needs alterations, to be worn after Tish’a B’Av. After all, since it
    cannot be worn at the time of purchase, one does not recite the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing at that time (<em>M.B.</em> 223:17). Furthermore, according
    to those who are accustomed to reciting <em>SheHechiyanu</em> [only] when they wear the clothing (which is the prevalent custom), one may buy a new garment
    during the Three Weeks, provided that he wears it, and recites the blessing, after Tish’a B’Av. But since we are supposed to curtail business dealings from
    the beginning of Av, it is preferable to avoid such a purchase, even though <em>SheHechiyanu</em> will not be said until afterwards (see below, sec. 18).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>8.8 – When is it Permissible to Recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em>? </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who is presented the opportunity to perform a mitzvah over which <em>SheHechiyanu</em> is recited, like a <em>brit milah</em> or <em>pidyon ha-ben</em>
, recites the blessing, because he did not determine the timing of the blessing. Rather, God granted him the opportunity to perform a mitzvah, over which    <em>SheHechiyanu</em> is recited, during the period of “between the straits” (<em>S.A.</em> 551:17).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, one who sees a close friend after a hiatus of thirty days, and is happy to see him, should recite the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing, for if he
    does not recite it immediately, he looses [the opportunity to say] the blessing [afterwards]. Likewise, when one sees his newborn baby daughter for the
first time, he should say <em>SheHechiyanu</em>, for if he fails to do so immediately, he forfeits the blessing (based on <em>S.A.</em> 225:1,    <em>M.B.</em> 223:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to most <em>poskim</em>, one may recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em> on the Shabbatot of the Three Weeks. Even though some rule strictly on this issue
    (based on the Ari z”l), in practice, one may be lenient and recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em> over a new fruit even on <em>Shabbat Chazon</em> [the Shabbat
    before Tish’a B’Av]. Therefore, if someone acquires a new fruit during the week, he should postpone eating it until Shabbat, and say <em>SheHechiyanu</em>
    then. And if he cannot delay its consumption – for example, he has no access to a refrigerator, and the fruit might rot by Shabbat – he should eat it
    immediately and recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em> (<em>Rama</em> 551:17, <em>M.B.</em> 551:98). The law is similar regarding a new article of clothing: one may
    say <em>SheHechiyanu</em> on the Shabbatot that occur before Rosh Chodesh Av, but after that one should act strictly and refrain from wearing the garment
    and saying <em>SheHechiyanu</em>, [even] on Shabbat (<em>M.B.</em> 551:98, <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:7).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>8.9 – Marriage and Engagement </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Most Jewish communities have a custom not to make weddings during the three week period of mourning over the Temple’s destruction. According to the letter
    of the law, the prohibition applies only to “optional” weddings – that of a man who already fathered a son and daughter and has thus fulfilled the mitzvah
    of procreation, but one who has yet to fulfill the mitzvah may get married even during the Nine Days. Nevertheless, the custom is not to make any weddings
    during this period, because it is a time of calamity. After all, it is fitting that a wedding be made with a good sign and good fortune, and these days do
    not have a good sign or good fortune. Some Sefardim avoid weddings only during the Nine Days.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Until Rosh Chodesh Av, one may make a modest, in-house engagement party, which is a celebration of the couple’s agreement to get married, because such an
    event contains a mitzvah component (see above, chap. 3, note 7, whether it is permissible to play music there). One may not, however, make a big engagement
    party during the Three Weeks. And during the Nine Days, when we must curtail our joy, it is forbidden to make even a modest, in-house party. However, the
    parents of the couple may get together, even during the Nine Days, in order to decide on the details of the wedding, and refreshments may be served. Even
    though this, too, involves joy, it is permissible because such a meeting transforms the couple’s relationship into an accomplished fact, which brings the
    mitzvah of marriage closer. It is also permissible for singles to meet for the sake of marriage during the Nine Days.

</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>8.10 – Haircuts</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Rabbis instituted a prohibition against taking haircuts and washing clothes during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls (<em>Ta’anit</em> 26b).
    Accordingly, the Shulchan Aruch (<em>O.C.</em> 551:3) rules that one may not take a haircut from the beginning of the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls, and
    many Sefardim follow this practice. It is forbidden to cut even children’s hair, if they have reached the age of <em>chinuch</em> (education), in order to
train them to mourn the Destruction. The custom, however, is to refrain from giving haircuts even to children who have yet to reach the age of    <em>chinuch</em>, in order to express the sorrow [we feel] during this period (<em>S.A.</em> 551:14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Ashkenazi Jews, as well as some Sefardim – including Jews from Morocco and Djerba, and those who follow the Ari’s customs – act strictly and avoid haircuts
    during the entire Three Week period (<em>Rama</em> 551:4; <em>K.H.C.</em> 80; <em>K.S.A.</em> Toledano, 387:8; <em>Brit Kehunah</em> 2:12. Jews from
    Tunisia and Algiers have a custom not to take haircuts starting Rosh Chodesh Av, based on [the ruling of] R. Yehudah Ayash.).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is debate whether [these communities] act strictly regarding children during the entire Three Week period or only during the week in which Tish’a
    B’Av falls. If needed, one may act leniently until the week of Tish’a B’Av (<em>M.B.</em> 551:82).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The prohibition does not apply only to head and facial hair. Rather, one may not cut any hair on the body. One may, however, cut moustache hair that
    interferes with one’s eating (<em>S.A.</em> 551:12-13).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A woman may cut her hair if it is beginning to slip out of her head covering due to its length. A woman may also remove facial or body hairs which mar her
    beauty (<em>M.B.</em> 79, <em>K.H.C.</em> 47).
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In honor of a <em>brit milah</em> (circumcision), the father [of the baby], the <em>sandek</em> (the one who holds the baby), and the <em>mohel</em> (the
    circumciser) may take haircuts, until the week of Tish’a B’Av.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is inappropriate for a bar mitzvah boy to take a haircut during the Three Weeks, because he can take one before the seventeenth of Tammuz. However, if
the father of the boy is accustomed to shaving every day, he may shave in honor of his son’s bar mitzvah celebration, until the week o f Tish’a B’Av (see    <em>K.H.C.</em> 551:10, <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may comb his or her hair even during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls (<em>M.B.</em> 551:20, <em>K.H.C.</em> 46). The <em>Acharonim</em> debate
    whether one may cut his or her nails during the Nine Days, but it is [certainly] permissible in honor of Shabbat (<em>M.B.</em> 551:20, <em>K.H.C.</em>
    48).
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>8.11 – Shaving One’s Beard during the Three Weeks </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    As we learned, the custom among Ashkenazim and some Sefardim is not to take haircuts during the entire Three Week period. When it comes to shaving the
    beard, however, a question arises.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to many <em>poskim</em>, there is no difference between taking a haircut and shaving – both are forbidden throughout this period (<em>K.H.C.</em>
    551:66, 493:19). This is the custom of most yeshiva students and those who observe <em>mitzvot</em> meticulously.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
However, some [authorities] maintain that it is fitting, <em>le-chatchilah</em>, to shave every Friday before Rosh Chodesh Av (based on <em>M.A.</em> and    <em>Pri Megadim</em>). Others permit one to shave every day until the first of Av, since doing so does not entail any joy. [According to them], the custom
    not to groom oneself applies only to haircuts, which are somewhat celebratory, not to shaving, which entails no festivity whatsoever, just the removal of
    unsightly [facial hairs]. One who acts leniently in this regard has upon whom to rely, and others should not rebuke him, especially in Israel, where people
    from all the communities live [side by side], and most Sefardim are lenient on this issue. And when there is a doubt regarding the Ashkenazi custom, one
    may take the Sefardi custom into account. In practice, everyone should follow his father’s custom – whether it is lenient or strict – to avoid diminishing
    his honor.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    After Rosh Chodesh Av, however, it is clear that Ashkenazim, and those Sefardim who follow this custom, should not shave, even in honor of Shabbat Chazon.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to all opinions and customs, one may not take a haircut during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls, nor is there any allowance to shave.

</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>8.12 – When Av Arrives, We Curtail our Joy </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages state in the Mishnah (<em>Ta’anit</em> 26b), “When Av arrives, we curtail our joy,” because these are days of mourning over the Temple’s
    destruction. Therefore, one should not engage in joyous activities, like hikes, hotel vacations, and social gatherings. Only events whose main purpose is
    educational or communal may be held. In addition, someone who needs to relax for health reasons may take a vacation in a hotel or a convalescent home (see
    above, sec. 6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom is to refrain from arranging the warp strings [on a weaving loom] during the Nine Days. The basis for this is the fact that the Foundation
    Stone, [upon which the Holy of Holies stood and] which is the foundation of the world, was abrogated. Therefore, we refrain from arranging the warp
    strings, which are the foundation of a garment. It is also forbidden to sew or knit new clothing or crochet a <em>kippah</em> (yarmulke) during the Nine
    Days (<em>S.A.</em> 551:7-8). However, it is permissible to mend old clothing. One who makes a living sewing clothing or manufacturing material, and he
    needs the income from the Nine Days, should ask a wise scholar how to act.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is best to cancel sewing lessons during the Nine Days, but if necessary, one may continue them, on condition that the students do not engage in the
    sewing of new garments. Rather, they should mend old ones or practice sewing on useless pieces of cloth.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Sages [also] say that one should curtail, during this period, business dealings that are joyous. It is even fitting to decrease our involvement in all
    types of transactions. We also stay away from building projects and plantings that are joyous; we will explain the details of this <em>halachah</em> later
    on (sec. 18). Since we curtail our joy during this period, the custom developed to refrain from meat and wine, which make one happy.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since these are days of calamity, our Sages recommend that one who is involved in a legal dispute with a gentile should avoid going to court in the month
    of Av, because the Jews have bad luck during this time and he is liable to lose the case (<em>S.A.</em> 551:1).
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="13"></a><h2>8.13 – Meat and Wine </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Rishonim</em> had a custom to refrain from eating meat and drinking wine during the days of mourning over the Destruction. Some kept this
    stringency every weekday throughout the Three Weeks, while others did so only during the week in which Tish’a B’Av fell. Most <em>Rishonim</em> held that
    the proper practice is to refrain from meat and wine during the Nine Days.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Mishnah</em> (<em>Ta’anit</em> 26b), one is forbidden to eat meat or drink wine only during the <em>se’udah ha-mafseket</em>, the last
    meal before the fast of Tish’a B’Av. Nonetheless, the <em>Rishonim</em> adopted the stringency of refraining from meat and wine during the [Nine] Days,
    because meat and wine are known to be joyous foods, and our Sages said, “When Av arrives, we curtail our joy.” Furthermore, when the Holy Temple was
    destroyed, we ceased offering meat sacrifices and pouring wine libations on the altar. Consequently, we should completely abstain from eating meat and
    drinking wine until the Temple is rebuilt, but we are unable to tolerate such a decree (see <em>Bava Batra</em> 60b). However, on the days that were
    established as times of mourning over the <em>Churban</em>, there is room to act strictly.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, Ashkenazim abstain from meat and wine all Nine Days, including Rosh Chodesh Av. This was also the Ari’s practice. According to the custom of
    most Sefardim, one is allowed to eat meat and drink wine on Rosh Chodesh; the prohibition starts when the day ends (<em>M.B.</em> 551:58, <em>K.H.C.</em>
    125). We are strict not to eat meat and drink wine on the tenth of Av, as well, because [most of] the Temple burned on that day. Ashkenazim abstain [only]
    until midday, while most Sefardim act strictly until the end of the day (<em>S.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em> 558:1, <em>K.H.C.</em> 10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Yemenite Jews are not strict about this [at all]; they eat meat and drink wine until the <em>se’udah ha-mafseket</em>, as the <em>Mishnah</em> rules.
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>8.14 – The Laws Pertaining to Eating Meat and Drinking Wine </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The prohibition against eating meat includes all types of meat: animal meat, fowl, fresh meat, and meat that was frozen and salted. Fish, however, is
    permitted.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom is to be particular even in regard to foods that were cooked together with meat. For example, if someone cooks potatoes with meat, one should
    not eat even the potatoes alone during the Nine Days, because the flavor of meat can be detected in them. It is, however, permissible to cook food in a pot
    usually used for meat, as long as there is no meat flavor in the food (<em>M.B.</em> 551:63, <em>K.H.C.</em> 142).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Grape juice is included in the prohibition against wine, but alcoholic beverages, like whisky and beer, are permitted. It is also permissible to season a
    dish with wine vinegar.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
If wine was added to dough, the resultant baked goods may be eaten during the Nine Days, because one cannot detect the flavor of wine in them. Ideally (    <em>le-chatchilah</em>), however, one should not mix wine into dough during this period.

    One who is sick, even just slightly, may eat meat and drink wine, if it helps him (<em>M.B.</em> 551:61). A woman who has given birth within the last
    thirty days may eat meat in order to regain her strength. Similarly, a nursing mother who needs meat in order to increase her milk supply may eat meat
    [during the Nine Days].
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to Sefardi custom, which some Ashkenazim follow as well, the person who recites <em>havdalah</em> after Shabbat Chazon may drink the wine over
    which he performed the service. In fact, he may drink the entire cup, but it is preferable to use grape juice, which does not cause joy. Other Ashkenazim
    follow a different custom: If there is a child who has reached the age of <em>chinuch</em> (religious training) in terms of reciting blessings before
    eating, but has yet to reach the age at which he understands why we mourn over Jerusalem (age six to nine), the person reciting <em>havdalah</em> has the
    child in mind when reciting the blessing over wine, and the child drinks it. If, however, no such child is available, the adult who performs the service
    drinks the wine.

<a name="15"></a><h2>8.15 – Meat and Wine on Shabbat Chazon and at a Se’udat Mitzvah </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We eat meat and drink wine on Shabbat Chazon, as we do every other Shabbat of the year. After all, even if Tish’a B’Av itself falls out on Shabbat,
    subsequently postponing the fast until Sunday, one may eat meat and drink wine that Shabbat; one may even adorn his table with a meal like that of [King]
    Solomon in his time, for there is no mourning on Shabbat (<em>S.A.</em> 552:10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is also permissible to taste the meat dishes that one is preparing in honor of Shabbat Chazon, to see if they need additional spices. When someone
    tastes food in this way, his or her intention is not to derive pleasure, rather to prepare for the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Oneg Shabbat</em> (delighting in
    the Sabbath).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, one may eat meat and drink wine at a <em>se’udat mitzvah</em>, like a meal in honor of a <em>brit milah</em>, <em>pidyon ha-ben</em>, or the
    completion of a Talmudic tractate. It is also permissible to eat meat and drink wine at a bar mitzvah celebration, provided that it takes place on the day
    the boy becomes obligated in <em>mitzvot</em> (see above, sec. 3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are different customs, however, regarding the number of people one may invite to such a meal. Some say that during the Nine Days one must limit [this
    number] and invite only the celebrants plus a <em>minyan</em> of men (a quorum of ten). Others maintain that one may invite… all those who he or she would
    have invited had it occurred a different time. According to the Rama, during the Nine Days, until Shabbat Chazon, one may invite anyone he would normally
    invite, but during the week of Tish’a B’Av, one should invite only a narrow <em>minyan</em> of men, in addition to the celebrants. In practice, the
    halachic ruling [one receives] varies according to circumstances and need.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Acharonim</em> write that one should not intentionally schedule the completion of a Talmudic tractate (a <em>siyum</em>) for the Nine Days, in
    order to permit the consumption of meat and wine, for doing so is a willful abrogation of the mourning over the Temple. Rather, only one who happens to
    complete a tractate during the Nine Days, in the course of his regular learning schedule, may organize a festive <em>siyum</em> meal, provided that he
    usually does so when completing a tractate similar to this one (<em>M.B.</em> 551:73).
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even one who regularly recites <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> over a cup of wine should say the blessings without wine during the Nine Days (<em>Rama</em>
    551:10, <em>K.H.C.</em> 152).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some have a custom to make a festive meal on the night before a <em>brit milah</em>, but it is not considered a <em>se’udat mitzvah</em>. Therefore, one
    may not eat meat or drink wine during such a meal [when it coincides with the Nine Days].
</p>
<a name="16"></a><h2>8.16 – Building and Planting during the Nine Days </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since we curtail our joy from the beginning of Av, one may not build a “joyous building” during the Nine Days. For example, one may not extend one’s house
    or widen one’s porch, unless there is a vital need for it. It is also forbidden to plaster or paint one’s walls, because these are considered luxuries that
    make a person happy. After all, one can live without them (S.A. 551:2). Similarly, one may not do renovations that are designed to beautify or embellish
    [one’s house], like replacing shutters (<em>trissim</em>), cabinets, curtains, or anything else that is precious, brings one joy, and is unnecessary.
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, one who lives with his family in a cramped apartment may build an additional room during the Nine Days. One may also do any type of construction
    that is designed to prevent damage. For example, if a wall is about to fall, one may knock it down in an orderly fashion and rebuild it, even if he does
    not need the room [in which it is found] and there is no danger involved, because [doing it this way] prevents damage.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is also permissible to build, plaster, or paint for the sake of a mitzvah, like building a synagogue or a school (<em>M.B.</em> 551:12, <em>K.H.C.</em>
    25). The author of <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> (551:7) believes that anything needed for the public good is considered a mitzvah-need and is permissible.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    During the [Nine Days], one may not plant anything that brings joy, like decorative trees, <em>hadasim</em> (myrtles), roses, or flowers (<em>S.A.</em>
    551:2). It is, however, permissible to upkeep a decorative garden – to water it, mow the lawn, and continue regular maintenance.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Any planting that has an actual purpose is permissible. Therefore, one may plant fruit-bearing trees during the Nine Days. Similarly, one who makes a
    living growing decorative bushes and flowers may plant them in his nursery in order to sell them.
</p>
<a name="17"></a><h2>8.17 – The Laws of Building during the Nine Days</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A Jewish contractor or Jewish workers may continue building apartments or houses during the Nine Days, in order to sell them, because the units are
    designed as living quarters not luxury suites. Besides which, this is their livelihood. And [if the houses are being built] in the Land of Israel, [there
    is an additional reason to rule leniently]: one fulfills a mitzvah by building houses there. Plastering and painting, however, should be postponed until
    after the Nine Days, unless this will cause excessive loss.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who plans on building or installing something superfluous must – <em>le’chatchila</em> – stipulate with the contractor that he will refrain from
    working during the Nine Days. If, however, he mistakenly neglected to do so, [simply] coming to an agreement with the contractor to do work for him, and
    the Nine Days arrive, he should ask him to stop working during this period. Then, if the contractor asserts his right to continue working, there is no need
    to break the contract with him (<em>M.B.</em> 551:12, <em>K.H.C.</em> 24).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A Jew who paints or plasters homes must stop working during the Nine Days, unless his customer is a non-Jew. And if, thinking that he can do the job
    quickly, he guarantees a fellow Jew that he will finish before the Nine Days, but is unable to do so in the end, he should ask the customer to exempt him
    from working during this period, and he should even offer to pay a small compensation fee. However, if the Jewish [customer] refuses to accept this, and
    the worker is afraid that he will sustain a great loss – like having to pay high compensation fees – he may continue working during the Nine Days.
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    [Halachic decisors] customarily rule that one should not enter a new apartment, owned or rented, during the Nine Days. However, if following such a ruling
    will cause great financial loss, one may enter [the apartment].
</p>
<a name="18"></a><h2>8.18 – The Laws of Transactions during the Nine Days</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We curtail joyous transactions during the Nine Days. That is to say, one may not buy extraneous items, like jewelry, clothing, fancy utensils, new
    furniture, and a family car. Actually, throughout the Three Weeks one may not purchase anything that requires the recitation of the <em>Shehechiyanu</em>
    blessing. But if it is something that does not require a <em>Shehechiyanu</em>, like a garment that still needs alterations, one may buy it until the first
    of Av (as explained above, sec. 7). During the Nine Days, however, one should refrain from purchasing joyous things. Therefore, one may not order a new
    garment from a tailor. The same applies to all items that bring one joy: if a <em>Shehechiyanu</em> blessing is recited over it, one may not purchase it
    throughout the Three Weeks, but if this blessing is not required, one may buy the item until the Nine Days begin.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, a person who comes across an opportunity to buy something joyful at a special price, and is afraid that he will miss out if he waits until after
    Tish’a B’Av, may purchase the item during the Nine Days. It is best, though, to bring it home or begin using it only after Tish’a B’Av.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is preferable to curtail even ordinary, non-joyous transactions. For example, one who usually makes a big shopping trip and stocks up on food and
    household items only once every few weeks should ideally do so before or after the Nine Days (<em>cf. S.A.</em> 551:2, <em>M.B.</em> 11:13).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may buy joyous items if they are needed for the sake of a mitzvah. Therefore, one may purchase <em>tefillin</em> or holy books during this period,
    because they are mitzvah accessories and because the custom is not to recite <em>Shehechiyanu</em> over them. One who does not have canvas or rubber shoes
    for Tish’a B’Av may – <em>be’di’avad</em> – buy them during the Nine Days (<em>Iggrot Moshe, O.C.</em> 3:80).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Merchants who deal in luxury items, like jewelry and [fancy] clothing, may do business during the Nine Days, in order to avoid losing their customers and
    thereby incurring great financial loss. They should, [however], try to engage mainly in preparations for transactions that will take place after the Nine
    Days. One who can close his store for the duration of the Nine Days without incurring significant financial loss must do so.

</p>
<a name="19"></a><h2>8.19 – The Prohibition of Washing Clothing</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Rabbis forbade us to wash clothes during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls (<em>Ta’anit</em> 26b). This is one of the ways we express mourning, for
    out of pain over and identification with the deceased or the destroyed Temple, we refrain from nurturing and pampering ourselves. Ironing and dry cleaning
    are included in this prohibition.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may not even wash clothing in order to wear them after Tish’a B’Av, because one who does laundry appears as though he is taking his mind off of
mourning over the <em>Churban</em>. It is also forbidden to give one’s clothes to a non-Jewish launderer [to have them washed] for use after Tish’a B’Av (    <em>S.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em> 551:3, M.B. 34).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Just as it is forbidden to wash clothing during this period, it is also forbidden to wear laundered clothing. This includes spreading fresh linens on a
    bed, putting a freshly laundered tablecloth on a table, and using clean towels or cloth napkins.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sefardim keep all the prohibitions against washing clothes as they appear in the Mishnah – that is, only during the week of Tish’a B’Av. Askenazim, on the
    other hand, forbid all these things from the beginning of Av. In honor of Shabbat Chazon, however, even Ashkenazim have a custom to wear laundered Shabbat
    clothes (Gra; see <em>M.B.</em> 551:6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since the prohibition against wearing laundered garments lasts several days, there is a custom to prepare a sufficient amount of “used” clothing for this
    period, as follows. Before the prohibited time begins, one wears several articles of clothing, each one for an hour or more. This way, the garments lose
    their status of “freshly laundered” and may be worn during the prohibited period. One who fails to do this may take a laundered garment, throw it on the
    floor, and even step on it. By doing so, it is no longer considered clean and may be worn.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    During this period, one may wear clean underwear and socks and change filthy hand towels. Since people are accustomed, nowadays, to changing these articles
    frequently, changing them does not entail any aspect of pleasure; rather, it is simply the removal of something repulsive. However, since it is hard to
    know exactly when the old ones have reached the point of being repulsive enough to be changed, it is preferable to place the fresh ones on the floor before
    wearing them, so that they will no longer be considered laundered.
    <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If someone soils his shirt with a stain that makes him look unpresentable, and he has no other shirt to wear, he may clean it with water, out of concern
    for human dignity. And if the stain does not come off with water [alone], he may avail himself of soap.
    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may not wear festive [lit., Sabbath] clothing during these days, even if they are not freshly laundered. This prohibition applies during the week of
    Tish’a B’Av, according to Sefardic Jews, and from the second day of Av, according to Ashkenazim. Therefore, one must remove his or her Sabbath clothes at
    the conclusion of Shabbat Chazon. For the sake of a <em>brit milah</em> (circumcision ceremony), however, the father, mother, circumciser, <em>sandak</em>,
    and the ones who escort the baby into the hall (<em>kvater</em>) wear festive clothing (<em>M.B.</em> 551:3).
</p>
<a name="20"></a><h2>8.20 – Children’s Clothing and Hospital Wear</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Baby clothing is not included in the prohibition, because babies regularly soil their outfits. It is also permissible to wash sheets and blankets of young
    children who wet themselves at night. In addition, many people act leniently, when necessary, with regard to washing older children’s clothing, because
they, too, soil their garments and there is no element of joy in doing laundry for them (<em>Rama</em> 551:14). Ashkenazi Jews may utilize this leniency,    <em>le’chatchilah</em>, until Shabbat Chazon (<em>M.B.</em> 551:82, based on <em>C.A.</em>). Afterwards, one may act leniently and wash [older children’s
    clothing only] if there is a pressing need, like when all of their clothing is soiled to the point where it would be unbecoming to dress the children in
    them.
    <button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may not add adults’ clothing to a load of children’s clothing that is being washed in a washing machine. And it is preferable, if possible, to dry even
    children’s clothing discreetly, inside the house, so as not to appear as one who is not mourning.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is permissible to change hospital sheets and wash the patients’ clothing, as one would do throughout the year, because the purpose of [laundering these
    items] is to maintain cleanliness and prevent infections, not to get pleasure or increase comfort. Guest houses and hotels may change their linens for
    incoming guests, because people nowadays are disgusted by previously used bedding (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:61). Ideally, a hotel guest should step on the
    sheets a little, to remove them from the category of “laundered.” Afterwards, he should ask [the attendants] not to change his bedding until after Tish’a
    B’Av.
    <button type="button" id="1018" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 18</button>
</p>
<a name="21"></a><h2>8.21 – Bathing</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though the Sages prohibited bathing on Tish’a B’Av alone, the <em>Rishonim</em> had a custom to refrain from bathing on the days preceding Tish’a
B’Av, as well. In Spain (<em>Sfarad</em>), many were strict not to wash themselves with hot water during the week of Tish’a B’Av. In Germany (    <em>Ashkenaz</em>), on the other hand, the custom was not to bathe at all during the Nine Days, even in cold water. They only rinsed themselves in cold
    water, in preparation for Shabbat Chazon (<em>S.A.</em> 551:16, <em>M.B.</em> ibid., <em>K.H.C.</em> 186).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Today, however, the routines of cleanliness and bathing have changed completely. In the past, people did not have running water in their homes. Therefore,
    bathing was considered a special occasion, a true pleasure and luxury, and people hardly suffered when they refrained from bathing. Nowadays, though,
    bathing has become a routine practice. Everyone is accustomed to washing themselves, and many bathe daily, with soap. If such a person goes a day without
    showering, he or she suffers, and some even have difficulty falling asleep as a result.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, anyone who feels pain when he refrains from washing himself – whether he is Sefardi or Ashkenazi – may bathe during the Nine Days and [even]
    during the week of Tish’a B’Av. The only restriction is that he should use lukewarm water, such that his only goal is to cleanse himself, not to enjoy the
    bath or shower. It is even permissible to use soap in order to remove a bad odor from one’s body. And if one cannot tolerate having unclean hair, he may
    wash his hair with shampoo.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If having a foul body odor due to lack of bathing does not bother a particular person, he should nonetheless shower during the Nine Days and the week of
    Tish’a B’Av…because human dignity is very important. Moreover, many people are sensitive to bad smells nowadays, and if one fails to clean himself, he will
    cause a desecration of God’s name.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Everyone bathes in preparation for Shabbat Chazon. The only distinction is that Ashkenazim use lukewarm water, [while Sefardim permit hot water]. Those who
    are accustomed to immersing in a <em>mikveh</em> [every day] may do so until the day before Tish’a B’Av, as long as the water is not hot.
    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Swimming for the sake of enjoyment is forbidden from Rosh Chodesh Av, because one must curtail joyous activities starting then. Swimming for health
    reasons, however, like those who swim half-an-hour a day, is permitted – according to Sefardi custom – until Shabbat Chazon. Afterwards, though, it is
    proper to refrain. According to Ashkenazi custom, [even this] is forbidden throughout the Nine Days. One who needs to swim for therapeutic purposes may
    swim up until the day before Tish’a B’Av (see above, sec. 6).
</p>
<a name="22"></a><h2>8.22 – Shabbat Chazon </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Shabbat Chazon is the Shabbat preceding Tish’a B’Av, on which we read the <em>Haftarah</em> of <em>Chazon Yeshayahu</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 1:1-27), which
    contains admonitions that [the prophet] pronounced to the Jewish people before the destruction of the Temple. According to Sefardic custom, the main
    expressions of mourning – like the prohibitions against laundering and bathing – begin immediately after that Shabbat, for that is when the week of Tish’a
    B’Av commences. Therefore, there are no signs of mourning on Shabbat Chazon in Sefardic circles. According to Ashkenazi tradition, however, several customs
    of mourning begin on Rosh Chodesh Av, making Shabbat Chazon part of the mourning period. Therefore, many Ashkenazim have a custom not to bathe in hot water
    or wear Sabbath clothing in honor of Shabbat Chazon, as the Rama writes (551:1, 16). Several great Ashkenazi rabbis, however, disagree with this custom,
    because one is not supposed to exhibit signs of mourning on the Sabbath day. Today, the prevalent custom among Askenazi Jews is to bathe in lukewarm water,
    with soap and shampoo, and to dress in laundered Shabbat clothing in anticipation of Shabbat Chazon. Some are stricter and leave out, or replace, one
    article of clothing, in order to express their sorrow over the <em>Churban</em> (<em>M.B.</em> 551:6).
    <button type="button" id="1020" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 20</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If a bar mitzvah boy is called up to the Torah on Shabbat Chazon, his parents may make a <em>kiddush</em> in his honor, as is done every other Shabbat of
    the year, for one should not exhibit signs of mourning on Shabbat. The same is true of a <em>Shabbat Chatan</em> (the Sabbath before a wedding, when the
    bridegroom is called up to the Torah): [the family and friends] may eat their meals together and serve a <em>kiddush</em>, as is customarily done.
    Similarly, when a baby boy is born, those who have a custom to make a <em>Shalom Zachor</em> party may do so in normal fashion. [The laws of Tish’a B’Av
    that falls out on Shabbat or Sunday will be explained later on, in chapter 9, section 4.]
</p>
<a name="23"></a><h2>8.23 – “The Week of Tish’a B’Av” When Tish’a B’Av is Postponed until Sunday </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The laws of the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls pertain [only] to Sefardim. According to their custom, one may not take a haircut or do laundry during that
    week, as the <em>Mishnah</em> states (<em>Ta’anit</em> 26b). Ashkenazim, however, follow a stricter custom and refrain from washing clothes starting Rosh
    Chodesh Av (above, sec. 19). And in terms of taking haircuts, Ashkenazim – and some Sefarding – are strict throughout the Three Weeks (above, sec. 10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A year in which Tish’a B’Av falls out on a Sunday does not have a “week in which Tish’a B’Av falls.” After all, the fast begins immediately after Shabbat
    and when the customs of mourning of the tenth of Av end, so do all the customs of mourning that pertain to the Three Weeks.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When Tish’a B’Av falls out on Shabbat, the fast is postponed until Sunday. Some say that since Tish’a B’Av is essentially on Shabbat, the entire week
    beforehand is considered “the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls” (Smag). Most <em>poskim</em>, however, hold that since the fast is actually observed on
    Sunday, that year does not have a “week in which Tish’a B’Av falls” (Rosh, Ran). This is how most Sefardim conduct themselves (see <em>S.A.</em> 551:4).
    Therefore, they may do laundry the entire week before Shabbat Chazon. However, even Sefardim should act strictly with regard to shaving. [That is], they
    should refrain from shaving during the week before Tish’a B’Av, in order to enter the fast with a recognizable sign of mourning on their faces (as
    explained above, note 7). Those who act leniently have upon whom to rely.

            Even though the fast [of the seventeenth of Tammuz] begins at daybreak, the mournful customs of the Three Weeks begin already the night before. For
            we learned above that the fast was originally supposed to start at night. The reason we begin fasting in the morning is because there are no harsh
            decrees against Israel nowadays. Therefore, it is up to the Jews to decide whether or not they want to fast, and they have decided to fast only
from daybreak. However, the Three Weeks begin on the night of the seventeenth of Tammuz. The Chida writes in this vein in            <em>Responsa Chayim Sha’al</em> 1:24, based on the Ramban. The author of <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 1:168), however, rules leniently,
            permitting weddings [on the night of the seventeenth of Tammuz]. Elsewhere (<em>O.C.</em> 4:112:2), he allows one to take a haircut then, if the
            need is great. The Tzitz Eliezer (10:26) disagrees, forbidding even weddings – which fulfill a <em>mitzvah</em> – on the night of the seventeenth,
            because the Three Weeks have already begun. This seems [correct to me]. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:7.

            <em>K.H.C.</em>
(551:40) cites a dispute among the <em>Acharonim</em> as to whether one may have music at a mitzvah-oriented celebration. The author of            <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> (25:6) rules stringently. <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (5:4) cites several <em>Acharonim</em> who are lenient on this issue.
            See also <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:13; he writes there that one should not act leniently after the first of Av.

            Among those who prohibit listening to music on the radio are [the following]: In <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> (<em>Y.D.</em> 2:137, <em>O.C.</em> 1:166),
[Rav Moshe Feinstein] leans towards ruling strictly, forbidding a person to listen to musical instruments [at any time] in our day and age. In            <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> (6:34), Rav Ovadyah Yosef permits musical instruments in general but forbids one to listen to them on the radio and the
            like during <em>Sefirat HaOmer</em> and the Three Weeks. (In private conversation, however, he allowed Arutz Sheva [to play music during these
periods], to avoid having to cancel the Torah-oriented segments.) The author of <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> (15:33) even forbids one to listen to            <em>a cappella</em> music on the radio during these [mournful] periods. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:13. However, the arguments of those who
            rule leniently are strong, especially seeing that the entire custom of refraining from listening to musical instruments and dancing during these
times is first mentioned in the works of the <em>Acharonim</em>; it is not an ancient institution. Similarly, the author of            <em>Responsa Chelkat Ya’akov</em> (1:62) concludes that listening [to music] on the radio or a music player is not included in the decree (or the
            custom of mourning), because these devices did not exist when [the decree was first enacted]. Rather, the <em>halachah</em> depends on [whether or
            not the music] gives one joy. We can also derive this from the fact that the <em>Acharonim</em> permit one to take music lessons during these
            periods [of communal mourning] because [such music] does not make one happy. Clearly, then, it all depends on the joy [the music provides]. The
            Maharam Schick (<em>Y.D.</em> 368) distinguishes between joyous music and sad music, [ruling] that sad music is not forbidden during times of
            mourning. This can also be inferred from the wording of the Rambam in <em>Hilchot Ta’aniyot</em> 5:14, where he discusses the prohibition of
            playing music after the <em>Churban</em>: “[The Rabbis] also made a decree against playing musical instruments… It is forbidden to rejoice in them
            or listen to them, because of the [Temple’s] destruction.” According to this, it appears that the prohibition relates mainly to listening to joyous
            music, which is associated with dancing, while regular songs and certainly sad ones are permissible. Others do not make any distinction between
            joyous and sad songs, being careful not to hear or play musical instruments during the Three Weeks or Sefirat HaOmer, but at the same time they
play joyous vocal songs, with no musical accompaniment. They are mistaken, however; for one should be stricter about hearing happy songs, even            <em>a cappella</em>, than hearing sad songs with musical accompaniment, concerning which one can rely on the lenient opinion. See R. Shmuel David’s
            article in<em> Techumin</em> 13. Also see above, 3.10.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Even according to the more stringent opinion, one who is listening to a radio talk show, which occasionally plays musical selections, is not
            obligated to turn the radio off. However, one who is careful to turn it off when the music comes on will be blessed (<em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 25:9).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            It seems that even according to the stricter <em>poskim</em>, one may act leniently on Friday afternoon and Saturday night, because the sanctity
            and joy of Shabbat surround these times. After all, we do not say the <em>Tachanun</em> prayer on Friday afternoons, and we wear Shabbat clothing
            after Shabbat.

            </a>
            The author of <em>Yesod VeShoresh HaAvodah</em> writes that it is fitting to refrain from enjoying oneself during the period of “between the
            straits” (<em>bein ha-metzarim</em>). R. Chayim Palagi writes (in <em>Masa Chayim</em>) that the [Rabbis of] his city instituted a prohibition
against taking a stroll through the orchards, on the beach, or along the banks of the river during <em>bein ha-metzarim</em> (quoted in            <em>S’dei Chemed</em>, <em>Ma’arechet Bein HaMetzarim</em> 1:10). The other <em>Acharonim</em>, however, did not cite this stringency. It is
            mentioned only in contemporary works (<em>Am KeLavi</em>, p. 170; <em>Nit’ei Gavriel</em> 23:3, as a subordinate opinion; <em>Mekra’ei Kodesh</em>,
Harari 5:1). It appears that this is [simply] a custom of [extra] piety, which is why most <em>Acharonim</em> do not cite it. In terms of practical            <em>halachah</em>: only during the Nine Days must one curtail pleasurable activities that bring joy. We find the same idea with regard to consuming
            meat and wine and engaging in joyous business transactions: they are forbidden [only] beginning with Rosh Chodesh Av. Similarly, there is no reason
            to prohibit hiking based on the danger factor. After all, the very [obligation] to avoid danger is a biblical command; we are simply extra cautious
            during these days; we do not set new safety rules. (See [<em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em>] 3:21, where R. Karp writes that although many people avoid
            [certain activities] because of danger, they are not forbidden by law. See also <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 25:14-15.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The same applies to bathing in an ocean or a river. It is similar to hiking both in terms of the pleasure [derived] and the danger [involved].
            Actually, there is a [<em>posek</em>] who is strict about this (<em>Makor Chayim</em> by the author of <em>Chavot Yair</em>, 551:4). However, many
            [authorities] permit it, as we find in <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> 150, [where the author writes] that they used to bathe in rivers during the Nine
            Days, and no one protested. The author of <em>Shulchan Gavo’ah</em> (end of 551) writes that the custom in Salonika was to swim in the ocean even
            on the day before Tish’a B’Av. [R. Ovadya Yosef] similarly writes in <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> (1:38) that it is permissible to swim in a pool or the
            ocean even during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls. It seems [more proper] to act strictly regarding bathing for pleasure during the Nine Days,
            not because of the bathing per se, but because we are supposed to limit our joy [once Av begins], as we will explain below. Nevertheless, we can
            derive [from the opinions quoted above], based on a <em>kal va-chomer</em>, that swimming and hiking are permissible during the Three Weeks.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            However, it is preferable, <em>le-chatchillah</em>, not to go with a large group on a hike or organize a summer camp during the Three Weeks,
            because these activities are extra joyous, being somewhat similar to folk dances. Nevertheless, <em>be-di’avad</em>, if it is very difficult to
            schedule the hike or camp for a different time, it may be done until Rosh Chodesh Av, for these activities are not [really] similar to dances,
            whose main purpose is merrymaking. The goal of a trip, on the other hand, is to acquaint [the participants] with a new place and let them enjoy the
            company.
            <strong>
                [Indeed], it would be fitting to change the scholastic calendar such that schools would be in session during the Three Weeks. This way, less
                people would take trips and go swimming during this period.
            </strong>
            As things stand today, however, [the Three Weeks] is when the camps operate and the yearly vacation falls out. Therefore, one should not be
            stricter than the law and forbid trips or swimming, until the first of Av. In terms of daily swimming, which is not considered recreational, but an
            [important] part of a healthy lifestyle: see below, sec. 21, [where we explain] that according to Sefardi custom it is proper to act strictly
            during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls, and according to Ashkenazim, from Rosh Chodesh Av. (See <em>Rav Po’alim</em> 4:29, which states that
            even though a person who begins swimming lessons before <em>bein ha-metzarim</em> should act strictly during the Nine Days, one should not rebuke
            him if he acts leniently and continues his lessons during the Nine Days and the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls. It is written in the name of the
            Chazon Ish that one is permitted to swim during the Nine Days for reasons of health. See also <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 3:21.)

            The Beit Yosef and Mishnah Berurah (551:14) explain that even marriages that fulfill a mitzvah are prohibited during this period, because they are
            inauspicious. The Gra (551:69) adds a novel idea, [explaining] that even from the standpoint of mourning the Destruction one should refrain from
            getting married during this period. After all, the Talmud (<em>Bava Batra</em> 60b) states that if it were possible, it would be appropriate to
            avoid marriage [altogether, after the Destruction]. Therefore, it is proper to refrain from getting married at least during the Three Weeks.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <strong>The Sefardi custom</strong>
            : Yemenite Jews do not make weddings starting from the seventeenth of Tammuz. The author of <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em> (from Turkey) rules that one
            may not even get engaged during the Three Weeks, and indeed, Moroccan Jews follow such a custom. The Ben Ish Chai (<em>Devarim</em> 4) forbids
weddings and writes concerning engagements that it is fitting to act strictly, in accordance with the words of <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em>.            <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> (551:44) also cites these words. R. [Mordechai] Eliyahu concurs in <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 25:3. The Shulchan Aruch (551:2),
            however, forbids weddings only during the Nine Days, and [the author of] <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (6:43) reinforces his words, adding that one should
            not be strict when it comes to restricting a mitzvah, especially in our generation.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            One may perform what the Torah defines as “engagement,” i.e., <em>kiddushin</em> without <em>chupah</em>, during the Nine Days, and even on Tish’a
            B’Av [itself], to ensure that no one else [takes the girl you want to marry] before you. This is permissible only on condition that no [festive]
            meal is served during the Nine Days. Nowadays, we perform the engagement (<em>eirusin</em>) and marriage (<em>nisu’in</em>) together. Nonetheless,
            we learn from the fact that <em>eirusin</em> is permitted that the parents of the couple may meet during the Nine Days in order to agree upon the
            conditions of the marriage. And light refreshments may be served there. This is found in <em>M.B.</em> 551:16.

            There are [<em>poskim</em>] who are [even more] lenient and hold that the prohibition against haircuts does not apply to woman [at all], in

            Regarding shaving during the Three Weeks: The Magen Avraham (551:14) writes in the name of Hagahot Ashri that according to Ashkenazi practice one
            should not get a haircut even before Shabbat, because people do not usually cut their hair every week. This implies that those who shave regularly
            may shave in honor of Shabbat. The Pri Megadim (<em>E.A.</em> 14) similarly writes that one may take a haircut for the sake of Shabbat, before Rosh
            Chodesh Av. True, the author of <em>Mateh Yehudah</em> (4) rules stringently, but the Pri Megadim’s opinion seems more correct in the case of
            shaving, because one who refrains from shaving looks unsightly on Shabbat. See also <em>B.H.</em> 551:3, [where the author says that] the
            Yerushalmi indicates that [haircutting] is permissible in honor of Shabbat even during the Nine Days. R. Akiva Eiger concurs. Another reason to be
            lenient: those who shave regularly generally feel great distress when they go several days without shaving. Perhaps this is similar to cutting
moustache hairs that interfere with eating, or applying ointment on Tish’a B’Av, which is permitted for someone who suffers from head sores (<em>S.A.</em> 554:15). It also coincides with what I heard, that one may cut hairs that cause sores or headaches. In a book called            <em>Nefesh HaRav</em>, R. [Hershel] Schachter writes in the name of R. [Joseph B.] Soloveitchik that the Three Weeks have the same status as the
            year-long mourning period [for a deceased parent], during which shaving is permissible; the customs of the Nine Days are like those of the
            thirty-day mourning period [over the death of a close relative], when shaving is prohibited; and Tish’a B’Av is equivalent to <em>shiva</em> (the
            first seven days of mourning). Based on this, he allows one to shave every day, until Rosh Chodesh Av, because not doing so makes a person look
disgraceful. See <em>Tzohar</em>, vol. 3, p. 39, where difficulties are raised on [R. Soloveitchik’s] opinion, but they can be dismissed. Also see            <em>Responsa Ner Ezra</em>, vol. 2, pp. 155-58, where the author concludes that one may shave before Shabbat, stating that this is the opinion of
            Rabbi Min-HaHar and R. Lichtenstein.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            However, many [<em>poskim</em>] rule strictly, forbidding shaving altogether. So writes the author of <em>K.H.C.</em>, 551:66. In section 493:19;
            he quotes <em>Acharonim</em> who say that one may shave if not doing so will cause a loss of income. Most Jews who observe the <em>mitzvot</em>
            meticulously follow this viewpoint. In <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 4:102), as well, [R. Moshe Feinstein] allows one to shave in order to
            avoid financial loss.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In my humble opinion, it seems that according to the letter of the law, it is appropriate even for those who follow Ashkenazi custom to shave every
            Friday, until the first of Av. On weekdays, however, it is preferable to be strict. Nevertheless, one who acts leniently has upon whom to rely. One
            may be lenient for <em>parnasah</em> (livelihood) purposes, as well. Starting the first of Av, it is proper to act strictly, both on weekdays and
            on Friday. Even though one could argue that it is imperative to shave in honor of Shabbat – as the <em>Yerushalmi</em> and R. Akiva Eiger imply, as
            cited in <em>B.H.</em> 551:3 – nevertheless, we find in the writings of the <em>Rishonim</em> (<em>Kol Bo</em>, cited in <em>B.Y.</em> 551:4) that
the custom is not to shave before Shabbat Chazon, in order to enter Tish’a B’Av as mourners. We also find that the prevalent custom in Germany (            <em>Ashkenaz</em>) was not to wear Shabbat clothing on Shabbat Chazon, as the Rama states in section 551:2. Now, even though we do not follow this
            custom, we can still learn from it that according to Ashkenazi practice, one need not be so concerned about the honor of Shabbat Chazon. Therefore,
            during the Nine Days, it is better not to shave before Shabbat. In my humble opinion, it is appropriate to recommend to Sefardim that they, too,
            refrain from shaving during the Nine Days. Firstly, this is the law for those who forbid haircuts throughout the Three Weeks (Jews from Morocco,
            Djerba, and those who follow the Ari’s customs; Tunisian and Algerian Jews avoid haircuts starting Rosh Chodesh). In addition, we find that this
            was the Sefardi custom, as cited in <em>Kol Bo</em> (by R. Aharon of Lunel, in Provence), that one must enter Tish’a B’Av in an uncomely state.
            Today, the most prevalent sign of mourning is being unshaven; and shaving, on the other hand, is a tangible expression of lack of mourning.
            Therefore, it is proper to display this sign of mourning during the Nine Days and on Tish’a B’Av. Furthermore, it is fitting to minimize discord,
when possible. [Accordingly], several contemporary authors write that Sefardim learning in Ashkenazi yeshivas should adopt Ashkenazi stringencies (            <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> 4:36). Even though our yeshivas today are not defined as Ashkenazi, rather as multi-cultural, it is preferable, when
            possible, to minimize variant customs. Therefore, when it comes to shaving for Shabbat before Rosh Chodesh Av, it is preferable to lean towards the
            custom of most Sefardim, who shave during the Three Weeks. During the Nine Days, however, it is better to lean towards the custom of the Ashkenazim
            and some Sefardim, who do not shave. Nonetheless, one should not rebuke someone who wants to rely on the logic found in <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> and
            the custom of some Sefardim, who shave in anticipation of Shabbat Chazon. During the week of Tish’a B’Av, everyone agrees that it is forbidden to
            shave.

            Practically speaking, I heard proper guidance from R. Rabinowitz, the head of Yeshivat Ma’aleh Adumim. He suggests that everyone follow his own
            father’s custom, to avoid a situation in which a father is shaven and his son is not, or vice versa, because that could be an affront to the
            father’s honor. I would add that if the father follows the stricter custom, there is reason to fear that if his son shaves, people will think that
            he is doing so for reasons of convenience, not for the sake of Shabbat, which will result in an affront to God’s honor. Furthermore, one should not
            ignore the fact that a man who refrains from shaving for three weeks demonstrates that observing Jewish customs is very important to him, and by
            doing so he sanctifies God’s name. See above, 3.7, note 9.

            The simple understanding is that one should avoid the gentile until Tish’a B’Av, but afterwards one may contend with him as he would throughout the
            year. The author of <em>Korban Netan’el</em> quotes this in the name of the <em>Zohar</em>. The Magen Avraham, however, cites Rabbeinu Yerucham as
            saying that one should be careful about this throughout the month of Av. See <em>M.B.</em> 551:2, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 2.

See <em>Sha’arei Teshuvah</em> 551:9. With regard to mixing wine or meat into a recipe: see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:39-40,<em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:49. Some [<em>poskim</em>] permit cognac made from wine and other ingredients, while others prohibit it; see            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:48. <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:42 mentions only the lenient opinion, because the drink is considered a new entity.

            According to many <em>poskim</em>, it is permissible to eat meat that is left over from Shabbat Chazon or from before Rosh Chodesh, because it will
            spoil if no one eats it. [R. Mordechai Eliyahu] writes in this vein in <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:46. Some <em>Acharonim</em> rule strictly on the
            matter, as cited in <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:34. Apparently, though, today, when the issue of wasting food is of no concern, because it is
            possible to freeze the meat, there is no allowance to eat meat left over from the Shabbat meals.

In terms of <strong>Melaveh Malka</strong> (the festive meal eaten after Shabbat): <em>K.H.C.</em> (551:144) cites opinions among the            <em>Acharonim</em> who permit one to eat Shabbat leftovers at the “fourth meal,” as long as one does not buy more than usual for Shabbat. The
            author of <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> writes that some [authorities] allow one who is accustomed to eating meat every Saturday night at the Melaveh
            Malka meal to do so after Shabbat Chazon, as well. There are those who rule strictly on this issue, too.

            Shulchan Aruch (551:10) states that one may drink the wine from <em>havdalah</em>. The Rama and M.B. (70) write that one should give it to a minor.
In <em>Darkei Moshe</em> (9), [the Rama] quotes the Maharil as saying that an adult may drink the wine from <em>havdalah</em> without hesitation (            <em>le-chatchilah</em>), all the more so [wine] from a <em>se’udat mitzvah</em>. Other <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> of Ashkenazi
descent followed this practice; see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:35 and <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4, note 74. It is preferable to recite<em>havdalah</em> over grape juice, because even though it is included in the prohibition against wine, it does not make one happy.            <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> (Harari, 1:14) quotes this in the name of R. Eliyahu. The author of <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> (loc. cit.) writes that
            it is possible that an adult may drink [the <em>havdalah</em> cup] <em>le-chatchilah</em>, if it is grape juice. <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> (p. 574)
            cites <em>Responsa Zechor LeAvraham Avigdor</em> (50) as saying that one may drink the entire cup.

            What is the age at which we train children to recite blessings but not to mourn over the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em>? The Eshel Avraham of Buchach
            explains that it is when they can understand the reason for the prohibition against eating meat, which is [to commemorate the fact] that the
            sacrifices were annulled. According to many [<em>poskim</em>], this occurs between the ages of six and nine, or ten. Others say that [it extends]
            until the age of thirteen (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:35:180).

According to <em>M.A.</em> and <em>C.A.</em>, one may – <em>le-chatcilah</em> – feed meat and wine to children who have not yet reached the age of            <em>chinuch</em>. Basing himself on <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, <em>Dagul Merivavah</em>, and <em>Derech HaChayim</em>, the author of <em>M.B.</em>
            (551:70) writes that this is permissible only in the case of <em>havdalah</em> or when they are weak.

            Regarding the number of invitees: See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:49, where [R. Eliyahu] summarizes the three opinions and leans towards the more
            lenient one. <em>M.B.</em> (77) and <em>K.H.C.</em> (165) indicate that there are two opinions as to what it means to limit the number of guests.
            According to the Levush, it means [inviting] ten people in addition to the ones actually celebrating the event and their relatives who may not
            testify for or against them. And the Levush believes that one must act this way throughout the Nine Days. The Rama, on the other hand, rules
            strictly only in regard to the week of Tish’a B’Av, but regarding that period he is even stricter [than the Levush is], [ruling that] in addition
            to the celebrants themselves, one may invite only a narrow minyan of people, including relatives. The author of <em>K.H.C.</em> further writes,
            citing <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, that some people have a custom not to eat meat or drink wine even at a <em>se’udat mitzvah</em>. Instead, they eat
            fish and serve other drinks, in order to avoid doubts regarding who may be invited. One certainly recites <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> (Grace After
            Meals) over wine after a <em>se’udat mitzvah</em>. Some people (Lubavitch Chassidim) are accustomed to completing Talmudic tractates specifically
            during the Nine Days, and they invite as many people as possible to the festive <em>siyum</em> meal, claiming that rejoicing over the Torah and
            increasing camaraderie are restorative. However, their opinion has not been accepted as final <em>halachah</em>. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em>
            551:38, <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:53 (p. 82), and <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:52. In actuality, the summer session in yeshivas ends on Tish’a
            B’Av, which means that the students [usually] complete the summer tractate during the Nine Days. But this is not done in order to cancel the
            mourning; therefore, the yeshiva may serve a distinguished meal, as befits the completion of a tractate that the students toiled over an entire
            trimester.

[Making or repairing] shutters and inessential cabinets is considered “joyous building.” This can be derived from <em>Iggrot Moshe</em>,            <em> O.C.</em> 3:82, regarding a cabinet. It also seems [appropriate] to forbid the putting up of wallpaper for decorative purposes, as the author
            of <em>B’Tzel HaChochmah</em> (4:54) writes (and contrary to what <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> cites, ibid.). Similarly, one may not install curtains that
            are [purely] ornamental; so writes the author of <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:4. If, however, the main goal of installing curtains or shutters is
            to ensure privacy, it would seem to be permissible. The example given in <em>Ta’anit</em> (14b) for a “joyous building” is a “wedding house” for
            one’s son. This is not practical today, which is why I did not mention it above.

            The authors of <em>K.H.C.</em> (551:28) and <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (5:19; see also 5:20) write in this vein. Investigation is needed to determine
            whether one is permitted to plaster or paint houses that are up for sale, or to build fancy villas in order to sell them. Apparently, one may be
            lenient on this issue if he is liable to suffer a loss. After all, building luxury items is prohibited only if it is being done for a specific Jew,
            because it entails joy. Preparing houses for sale, however, is considered working in order to make a living.

            The Beit Yosef explains that there are two types of prohibitions: It is clear from Tosafot in <em>Megillah</em> (5b) that one may not trade in
            luxury items that bring a person joy. In <em>Yevamot</em> (43a), however, Tosafot cite an opinion which states that one should curtail all business
            dealings. From [the Beit Yosef’s formulation in] <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, it seems that he holds that one must heed both opinions, and they do not
            contradict each other. Section 551:2 deals mainly with joyous transactions, while section 554:22 implies that one should curtail all business
            dealings. The Mishnah Berurah (551:11) writes that the custom is to be lenient regarding regular transactions, because of the difficulty of making
            a living. This is why I presented the main prohibition as applying to joyous items and added that one should, ideally, curtail all business
            dealings. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:16, where the author allows regular transactions altogether, even defining cabinets and appliances as
            non-joyous items. However, the author of <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 3:82) writes that purchasing bookcases brings one joy, and one
            should, therefore, avoid doing so during the Nine Days. It also seems [to me] that one should refrain from buying anything that brings joy, unless
            there is concern of financial loss. Under such circumstances, the Rabbis permit [transactions], just as they permit building a “joyous” wall, if
            there is concern that [not doing so] will cause damage (<em>M.B.</em> 551:13). This is why I wrote that merchants may continue business [as usual],
even if they deal in luxury items, because they are liable to sustain a loss if they stop working. Several <em>Acharonim</em> concur with this; see            <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 13. (These merchants are not helping others commit a sin, because perhaps their customers are buying for the sake of a
            mitzvah and cannot postpone their purchase. And even those who are buying sinfully: since they can buy elsewhere, there are those who say that the
            prohibition of <em>lifnei iver</em> [putting a stumbling block in front of the “blind”] does not apply to Rabbinic commandments.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            If [the postponement of] buying furniture and clothing for a soon-to-be-wed couple would delay the wedding, it is permissible to purchase these
            items during the Nine Days, because doing so is for the sake of the mitzvah of marriage. This is allowed [only] on condition that the groom has not
            yet fulfilled the mitzvah of procreation (<em>Rama</em> 551:2, <em>M.B.</em> 14). Nowadays, however, postponing these purchases does not delay the
            wedding, because people book a hall and send out invitations around two months in advance and it is possible to buy everything before or after the
            Nine Days. Either way, no one will cancel the wedding on account of these purchases. Only in rare cases, when the families are under great
            pressure, may we permit them to buy clothing, just like we permit [many things] in situations of great need.

            Ashkenazim wear laundered clothing on Shabbat Chazon, according to the Gra’s opinion, as cited in <em>M.B.</em> 551:6. Nonetheless, one should not
            change linens, because that is unnecessary. This can be found in <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:26.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The suggestion of throwing laundered clothes on the floor is cited in <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 10:44, in the name of <em>Kerem Shlomo</em>.
Regarding underwear and socks: in earlier generations, the custom was to forbid [changing them], as one can infer from <em>M.B.</em> 551:6 and            <em>K.H.C.</em> 91 in the name of the Ben Ish Chai. Today, however, we are more particular, and we find it very difficult to tolerate the odor that
            emanates from these garments. In addition, the Ben Ish Chai himself (<em>Devarim</em> 6) permits one to wash handkerchiefs because people are
            repulsed by them. Therefore, the accepted practice is to use laundered underwear and socks. This is also mentioned in <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em>
            551:17. See <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:27, where the author writes that one should throw them on the floor for an hour.

            <strong>Shining shoes:</strong>
            According to most <em>poskim</em>, this is not in the same category as washing clothes and is permissible [even] during the week of Tish’a B’Av. So
write the authors of <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 3:31) and <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> (4:23). The author of <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> (            <em>O.C.</em> 3:80) allows one to polish shoes as long as he does not shine them. In <em>O.C.</em> 3:79, he forbids dry cleaning, equating it to
            regular laundering.

            It is important to note that the Jews of Djerba (<em>Brit Kehunah</em>), as well as some Moroccan Jews, refrain from washing clothes from Rosh
            Chodesh Av.

            It seems that cleaning a local stain with water alone is not included in the prohibition of doing laundry [during the Nine Days]. Accordingly, the
            author of <em>Gesher HaChayim</em> (21:10-11) writes, with regard to the seven day mourning period [for the death of a close relative], that one
            may wash out a stain with water. The author of <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> (4:14) concurs. And if the person cannot go out [in public] without
            cleaning the stain with a little soap, he may do so. Firstly, it is possible that rubbing out a stain while wearing the garment is not the type of
clothes-washing that was prohibited. Furthermore, “Human dignity is so important that it overrides a biblically ordained negative commandment” (            <em>Berachot</em> 19b).

            The Rama writes (551:14) that the [prevailing] custom is not to refrain from washing children’s clothing. We act leniently in this regard until the
            age of <em>chinuch</em>, i.e., six years old, and when necessary, we are even more lenient. The author of <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> (4:16)
            writes in the name of Rav Elyashiv that the custom is to regard eight year olds as small children. It seems [to me] that when dealing with children
            who get themselves very dirty, even older children are considered “youngsters.”

            A Jew may not do laundry for a gentile during the Nine Days. This is prohibited because of <em>mar’it ayin</em> (appearances) – i.e., people will
            think that he is washing a Jew’s clothing. If, however, it is clear that the clothing belongs to a gentile, he may wash them. A Jewish launderer
            who has nothing to eat may wash clothing for non-Jews during this period (<em>M.B.</em> 551:42). Even Ashkenazim are strict about doing laundry for
            gentiles only during the week of Tish’a B’Av (<em>M.B.</em> 551:43). <strong>One who runs a laundry service for a living</strong> may operate it
            until Shabbat Chazon, even if he is Ashkenazi, because Sefardim are allowed to wash clothes until then, and the Ashkenazi custom is to allow
            [laundering] for one who owns just one garment or in honor of the Sabbath. (See <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 4:20, where the author permits one who
            is afraid he might lose his job to work even during the week in which Tish’a B’Av falls. This requires further investigation. See also ibid. 4:28.)

            In relation to Yom Kippur, the Shulchan Aruch (<em>O.C.</em> 613:1) states explicitly that one may wash his hands or body if they get soiled,
            because [the Rabbis] prohibited only washing for the sake of enjoyment. The Mishnah Berurah (2) infers from his language that one who sweats
            profusely may wash himself in order to remove the filth, because such washing is not for pleasure. In the end, though, the M.B. permits this only
            for an <em>istanis</em> – a delicate and sensitive individual. However, if [the <em>poskim</em>] permit this on Yom Kippur, which is biblically
            ordained – and several <em>Rishonim</em> hold that even the prohibition against washing is Torah based – [one may] certainly [act leniently] during
            the Nine Days, when the prohibition against washing is less stringent and is based on the custom of the <em>Rishonim</em>.

        <p dir="LTR">
            Today, almost everyone is an <em>istanis</em> with regard to foul odors. For not only do we have water faucets for washing, we also have sewage
            pipes that remove excrement and urine. In the past, these waste products would flow in trenches in between the houses, or they were buried near the
            villages. Therefore, foul odors were commonplace. It is evident that all the laws relating to foul odors are determined based on what is accepted.
            Therefore, we are stricter nowadays [SHOULDN’T IT SAY “more lenient”???] (see <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 3:10). In addition, the
            routines of bathing have changed completely, and we bathe much more frequently than in the past. We are <em>istanis</em>es in this area, and we are
            permitted to bathe for the sake of cleanliness. The only qualification is that one use lukewarm water, so as not to derive pleasure from it. One
            should not be strict and wash exclusively in cold water, because most people are used to pampering themselves with hot water, and bathing in cold
            water would cause them great pain. Therefore, one should use water that causes neither suffering nor pleasure. It is also fitting to note that the
            difference between the Ashkenazi and Sefardi customs apparently stems from the difference in climate [in the areas in which each of these groups
            lived]. There is a greater need to bathe [frequently] in the hotter, southern lands than there is in the colder, northern lands. Moreover, the
            conventional wisdom among the non-Jews in Ashkenaz (Germany) at the time was that bathing is detrimental to one’s health, and they would bathe only
            once every few months. The Jews who lived there were also influenced by this viewpoint to some degree. Therefore, they acted strictly during the
            Nine Days. Today, however, [especially] in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, people suffer greatly from not bathing, and the custom, therefore, is to be
            lenient. (See also <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:48-49; as well as <em>Hilchot Chag B’Chag</em> 4:56-61 [pp. 83-89], where the author elaborates
            upon the stringency of the Ashkenazic custom while explaining the laws of an <em>istanis</em> only briefly. See also <em>Aveilut HaChurban</em> p.
            155.)

Ashkenazim read some of the verses of the <em>Haftarah</em> of Shabbat Chazon and one verse of <em>Parashat Devarim </em>in the tune of            <em>Eichah</em> (even when that Shabbat does not fall out on the ninth of Av). Sefardim, however, refrain from doing so, to avoid any expression of
            mourning on Shabbat.
