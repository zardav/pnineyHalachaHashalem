Chapter Thirteen: The Laws and Customs of Erev Pesah
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. The Prohibition against Work (<em>Melakha</em>) on Erev Pesah
</h2>
<p>
    When the Temple stood, one who offered a sacrifice was prohibited from performing <em>melakha</em> (doing productive work) that day, as it was like a
    holiday for him, and it is inappropriate to perform <em>melakha</em> while one's sacrifice is being offered up on the altar. The same applies to Erev
    Pesah, a day on which Israel is obligated to offer the <em>korban Pesah </em>(Paschal sacrifice), and which is consequently like a holiday for everyone.
    But since the time for offering the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em> does not begin until midday, the prohibition against <em>melakha</em> also does not
    begin until midday. In some places, people adopted the stringent practice of refraining from <em>melakha</em> from the morning of the fourteenth of Nisan,
    and in such places this custom was binding. Even now, after the destruction of the Temple, this prohibition remains in effect, and it is forbidden do
    perform significant <em>melakha</em> after midday on the fourteenth of Nisan. This custom also prevents one from becoming preoccupied with work and
    forgetting to destroy his <em>hametz</em> and prepare matza, wine, and other necessities for the Seder<em> </em>night.
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, the Sages instituted a ban on significant <em>melakha</em> every Erev Shabbat so that people would be free to prepare for Shabbat. However, the
    prohibition on Erev Pesah is more severe, for while the Sages taught that whoever performs <em>melakha</em> on Erev Shabbat will see no sign of blessing
    from it, those who performed <em>melakha</em> on Erev Pesah were actually excommunicated.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, the <em>halakha</em> is that <em>melakha</em> is forbidden on Erev Shabbat from the time of <em>minha</em> <em>ketana</em> (two and a half
    seasonal hours before sunset), while the prohibition on Erev Pesah begins at midday.

2. Which <em>Melakhot</em> Are Forbidden?    
</h2>
<p>
    The ban on <em>melakha</em> after midday on Erev Pesah applies to full-fledged work that people typically do for a living, such as sewing, building
    furniture, and gardening. However, one may cook, clean the house, or travel before the holiday. As a rule, the ban on <em>melakha</em> on Erev Pesah is
    similar to the ban on <em>melakha</em> during <em>Hol</em> <em>Ha-mo'ed</em>, and in certain cases is even slightly more lenient. Therefore, everything the
    Sages permit on <em>Hol</em> <em>Ha-mo'ed</em> is also permitted on Erev Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    There are three types of <em>melakha</em>: <em>melakha gemura</em> (full-fledged work), professional repair work, and the simple work of a
    non-professional. <em>Melakha gemura</em> like sewing garments, building furniture, and cutting hair, is always forbidden, even if it is done for free.
    However, mending clothes, even if it demands professional expertise, is not considered <em>melakha gemura</em>. Therefore, if the mender receives payment,
    it is forbidden, but if he works for free and the mending is needed for the festival, it is permitted. Simple work like sewing a button, if needed for the
    festival, is permitted even for pay on a temporary basis. It is likewise permissible for one to summarize his ideas in writing as he studies, but if he
    earns a living from typing or copying, it is a <em>melakha</em> <em>gemura</em> and thus forbidden (SA 468:1, 2).

</p>
<p>
    Though it is forbidden to have one's hair cut after midday on Erev Pesah, it is permitted to shave with one's own shaver, because this is non-professional
    work. It is likewise permitted to iron clothes, shine shoes, and cut fingernails after midday in preparation for the festival. However, some are stringent
    to shave and cut fingernails before midday.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    As noted, all <em>melakhot</em> permitted by the Sages on <em>Hol</em> <em>Ha-mo'ed</em> are also permitted after midday on Erev Pesah. This, in short,
    includes five types of <em>melakhot</em>: 1) <em>melakha</em> to prepare food for the festival; 2) non-professional work for pay and impromptu skilled
labor for free; 3) <em>melakha</em> to prevent substantial loss; 4) <em>melakha</em> done for public benefit or for the sake of a mitzva; 5)    <em>melakha</em> performed by a poor person who lacks the money to buy festival necessities.

3. <em>Ta'anit Bekhorot</em> - the Fast of the Firstborns    
</h2>
<p>
    Firstborn males have a custom to fast on Erev Pesah to commemorate the miracle performed for them: all Egyptian firstborn males died while firstborn
    Israelites were saved.
</p>
<p>
    In order to give some sense of the significance of <em>Makat</em> <em>Bekhorot</em> (the Plague of the Firstborn), we must first note that besides being
    the eldest male child, the firstborn embodies something primal, for with his birth the new life of the next generation begins to unfold. The firstborn thus
    bears great responsibility. If he chooses the path of virtue, he will express that primal root - faith in the Creator of the universe - and the rest of the
    children in the family will follow in his path. But if he chooses the path of evil, denying God and viewing himself as great and significant, he will
    always be striving to enhance his own glory and satisfy his appetites. This was the sin of the Egyptians, who considered themselves the lords of the earth
    and denied God's existence. When they were commanded to send Israel away to worship God, they stubbornly refused to let them go. Pharaoh, himself a
    firstborn, led them in their pride and heresy.
</p>
<p>
    The first day of Pesah is itself a kind of "firstborn": it is the first day on which God began to reveal Himself in the world. Until this time, individual
    miracles were performed for special people, but not on a national level, via an entire people, the people of Israel. When the great day arrived, the day
    designated for the revelation of the root of faith in the world, a severe accusation against the firstborns of Egypt, who denied God<em>'s</em> existence,
    was aroused. Upon God's revelation at midnight, they were all broken and slain. In contrast, the <em>bekhorim</em> of Israel, who expressed their faith in
    God by obeying His commandment, on the eve of the Exodus, to slaughter a lamb, which was an Egyptian god, risking their lives by smearing its blood on the
    doorposts, were saved and sanctified.
</p>
<p>
    Each year, we relive the special time of Seder night, when the source of our faith was revealed. However, as this holy night approaches, the accusation
    against the <em>bekhorim </em>is reawakened: are they as committed to the Torah and the <em>mitzvot</em> as they should be? Are they expressing God's name
    in the world as they should? Firstborns therefore have a custom to fast and repent on Erev Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    This fast is less strict than other fasts. All of the other fasts were instituted by the Sages, but <em>Ta'anit</em> <em>Bekhorot</em>, a custom adopted by
    many <em>bekhorim</em>, was never instituted as a binding obligation by the Sages. It is therefore customary to be lenient. For example, if one suffers
    from a headache, or from a pain in his eye, he is exempt from <em>Ta'anit</em> <em>Bekhorot</em>, even though he is not considered sick and would not be
    exempt from other fasts. Likewise, if one thinks that by fasting he will not be able to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza and recount the story of the
Exodus, it is better that he not fast. Furthermore, the custom is that whoever participates in a <em>se'udat</em> <em>mitzva</em> is exempt from    <em>Ta'anit</em> <em>Bekhorot</em> (<em>Birkei</em> <em>Yosef</em> �470; MB 470:2, 10).

</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Who Is Included in the Custom to Fast?
</h2>
<p>
There are two types of <em>bekhorim</em>, and both are included in this custom, because both types of <em>bekhorim</em> died in Egypt. The first type is a    <em>bekhor</em> to one's father, the <em>bekhor</em> who inherits a double portion of his father's estate. Even if his mother bore children from a previous
husband, or had an earlier miscarriage (and he is therefore not considered his mother's firstborn and need not be redeemed by <em>pidyon ha-ben</em>),    <em> </em>the custom of fasting applies to him, because he is a <em>bekhor</em> to his father with regard to the law of inheritance.
</p>
<p>
The second type is a <em>bekhor</em> to one's mother, the <em>bekhor</em> to whom <em>pidyon ha-ben </em>applies. Customarily, he too observes    <em>Ta'anit</em> <em>Bekhorot</em>, even if his father already had children with another woman and he will not inherit the double portion. He has the
    status of "<em>petter</em> <em>rehem</em>" (the first to emerge from his mother's womb). The firstborn to a mother who was born via Caesarean section lacks
the status of <em>bekhor</em> both with regard to inheritance and with regard to <em>pidyon ha-ben</em>, and therefore need not fast on Erev Pesah (    <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 470:3; however, some are scrupulous about participating in a <em>siyum</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Firstborn Kohanim and Levi'im also observe the custom of fasting. Although the Torah exempts them from <em>pidyon</em> <em>ha-ben</em>, they are
    nonetheless <em>bekhorim</em> (MB 470:2).
</p>
<p>
    A firstborn female need not fast. While it is true that some authorities maintain that female <em>bekhorot</em> also died in Egypt, the prevailing custom
    is that they do not fast (Rema, Hida, <em>Bah</em>, and <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 470:17).
</p>
<p>
    Customarily the father of a <em>bekhor</em>, even if he himself is not a <em>bekhor</em>, fasts instead of his son until the boy grows up (Rema 470:2). If
    the father is also a <em>bekhor</em>, his own fast counts for his son, and if he participates in a <em>se'udat</em> <em>mitzva</em>, he is exempt from
    fasting for his son as well. This is the custom according to many <em>poskim</em>, but Rema takes a more stringent position.
</p>
<p>
    When Pesah falls on Shabbat, the custom is to move <em>Ta'anit</em> <em>Bekhorot</em> up two days, to Thursday.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. The Custom to Rely on a <em>Siyum Masekhet</em>     
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Bekhorim</em>
    customarily participate in a <em>siyum</em> <em>masekhet</em> (a festive ceremonial meal occasioned by the completion of a tractate of the Talmud) on Erev
    Pesah after <em>Shaharit</em>. Afterward, refreshments are served to everyone in attendance, and the <em>bekhorim</em> present are permitted to partake,
    sharing in the joy of a <em>se'udat</em> <em>mitzva</em> and celebrating the mitzva of Torah study and the completion of the tractate. Having already
    broken their fast with the <em>se'udat</em> <em>mitzva</em>, <em>bekhorim</em> are no longer obligated to fast.
</p>
<p>
    However, <em>poskim</em> of past generations were divided over this custom. Some took a stringent position, ruling that only a <em>bekhor</em> who himself
    completed a tractate may partake of the <em>se'udat mitzva</em>, while other firstborns, who are not so connected to the joy of the <em>siyum</em>, may not
break the fast by partaking in someone else's <em>se'uda</em>. This is especially true when those completing the tractate do not hold a<em>se'udat mitzva</em> on such occasions during the course of the year, and the <em>bekhorim</em> as well do not generally attend their friends'    <em>siyumim</em>. By arranging a <em>siyum</em> for firstborns once a year on Erev Pesah<em>,</em> it appears as though they are<em> </em>coming not to
    celebrate the mitzva, but to exempt themselves from the fast. Moreover, often the person making the <em>siyum </em>completed the tractate a week or two
    earlier and postponed the <em>siyum </em>until Erev Pesah in order to exempt himself from fasting. According to the stringent opinion, it is improper to
    act in this manner, because the real joy is felt when one completes his study, not when he recites the last few lines so that he can make a <em>siyum </em>
    on Erev Pesah (<em>Teshuva</em> <em>Me-ahava</em> vol. 2 p. 261; <em>Noda</em> <em>Bi-Yehuda</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, the custom nowadays is to rely on the lenient <em>poskim</em> who rule that anyone who participates in the <em>se'udat mitzva</em> is exempt
    from fasting, even if he does not usually make or attend <em>siyumim </em>during the course of the year, and even if the <em>siyum </em>was delayed until
Erev Pesah. The simple reason for this is that when a <em>masekhet</em> is completed, it is fitting to celebrate, and this is therefore a <em>se'udat</em>    <em>mitzva</em>. Moreover, <em>Ta'anit</em> <em>Bekhorot</em> is predicated entirely on custom, not on a binding enactment, and is not mentioned at all in
    the Bavli or by Rambam. Furthermore, some leading Rishonim were of the opinion that <em>bekhorim</em> are not obligated to fast on Erev Pesah. This being
    the case, whenever there is a halakhic disagreement, the lenient <em>poskim</em> have the upper hand. What is more, in recent generations we no longer fast
    often, and if the <em>bekhorim</em> fast, their preparations for Pesah will most likely suffer from the weakness it induces; they will even want to rush
    through the Hagada in order to get to the meal. Therefore, many leading rabbis would exempt themselves from the fast via a <em>siyum</em>. Only one who
    knows that the fast will not impair his preparations for Pesah or his fulfillment of the <em>mitzvot</em> of Seder<em> </em>night may act stringently and
    fast on Erev Pesah. Indeed, Rav Kook and his son R. Zvi Yehuda, both of whom were firstborns, customarily fasted on Erev Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    The type of <em>siyum</em> that exempts its participants from fasting is one that marks the completion of a tractate of the Bavli or Yerushalmi, or an
    entire <em>seder</em> of Mishna. The study must involve understanding and not mere rote reading.

<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. The Prohibition on Eating Matza on Erev Pesah
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages forbade eating matza on Erev Pesah, in order to increase our desire to eat it during the Seder and in order to distinguish between matza eaten
    before Pesah and the matza eaten as a mitzva during the Seder. This prohibition applies even to children who understand the idea that the matza
    commemorates the Exodus from Egypt<em>.</em> It is permissible to feed matza on Erev Pesah to small children who do not understand this.
</p>
<p>
    The prohibition begins at dawn on the fourteenth of Nisan, though some choose to be stringent and refrain from eating matza from the beginning of Nisan.
    Others refrain from eating matza thirty days before Pesah. However, the letter of the law only requires one to refrain from eating matza on the fourteenth
    of Nisan (MB 471:12).
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Israeli hospitals and army bases ordinarily destroy <em>hametz</em> several days before Pesah, because otherwise there is concern that <em>hametz</em> will
remain in the kitchens and camps during Pesah. Matza is served so that the soldiers and patients have what to eat, so they should refrain from eating such    <em>matzot</em> on Erev Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    The prohibition against eating matza on Erev Pesah includes even small pieces of matza that have been kneaded with wine or oil. Even if such a mixture is
    baked, as long as the pieces are identifiable as matza, the blessing before eating them is "<em>ha-motzi</em>" and it is forbidden to eat them on Erev
    Pesah. However, if after being kneaded and baked the pieces are no longer identifiable as matza, their <em>berakha</em> is "<em>mezonot</em>" and they may
    be eaten on Erev Pesah (implied in Rema 461:2 and MB <em>ad loc.</em> 19-20). Some <em>poskim</em> are more stringent, maintaining that even if the matza
    is crumbled like matza meal, kneaded with oil or wine, and baked into cake or cookies so that they are no longer identifiable as matza, it is forbidden to
eat them. This is because one who eats enough of them to constitute a meal ("<em>kevi'at</em> <em>se'uda</em>") still must recite the <em>berakha </em>of "    <em>ha-motzi.</em>" Thus, it is apparent that they have not yet lost the status of matza, and consequently the prohibition applies to pastries made of
    matza meal (Gra, Rav Kook, and<em> Hazon Ish</em>).
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    However, all <em>poskim</em> agree that it is permissible to eat matza balls on Erev Pesah, because after being cooked they no longer carry the status of
    matza. Even if one eats enough of them to constitute a meal, their <em>berakha</em> is "<em>mezonot</em>," because they are a cooked food, not a baked good
    (MB <em>ad loc. </em>20). Moreover, even if one cooks a whole piece of matza the size of a <em>kezayit </em>or more, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that
    although its <em>berakha</em> is "<em>ha-motzi,</em>" one may eat it on Erev Pesah (as explained below 14:1).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. Summary: What Can Be Eaten on Erev Pesah
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, the Torah prohibits eating <em>hametz</em> after midday on the fourteenth of Nisan, and the Sages extended the prohibition by two hours
    as a safeguard. Hence, one may eat <em>hametz</em> on Erev Pesah until the end of the fourth seasonal hour (i.e., the first third of the day). There are,
    as is evident from Jewish calendars, two approaches to calculating these hours. According to <em>Magen</em> <em>Avraham</em>, we begin calculating them
from dawn; according to the Vilna Gaon, from sunrise. Ideally, one should be stringent and calculate the onset of the prohibition according to    <em>Magen</em> <em>Avraham</em>. However, when necessary, since the prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> after the fourth hour is rabbinic, one may
    be lenient and finish one's <em>hametz</em> meal by the end of the fourth hour according to Gra's<em> </em>calculation (see above 3:6).
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
After four hours, a problem arises for those who customarily refrain from eating <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesah: what can one eat to satisfy his hunger?    <em>Hametz</em> and <em>kitniyot</em> are forbidden, and even matza is rabbinically forbidden on the fourteenth of Nisan. We have seen that even matza
    meal-based cakes and cookies are subject to dispute among <em>poskim</em>. In practice, since this disagreement pertains to a rabbinic prohibition, one may
    be lenient, though stringency is commendable. According to all opinions, one may eat matza balls.
</p>
<p>
    Egg matza (or <em>matza ashira</em>, which includes matza kneaded with oil, wine, or any other fruit juice) may be eaten on Erev Pesah and Pesah according
to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, but according to the custom of Rema it is forbidden (SA 461:1-4). Nowadays, serious concerns have arisen about the way    <em>matza ashira</em> is produced, and according to most <em>poskim</em>, even Sephardic Jews must refrain from <em>matza ashira</em>, even on Erev Pesah
    after midday (see above 8:1).
</p>
<p>
    Even those whose custom it is to eat <em>matza ashira</em> (when produced in a completely halakhic way) may eat it only until the end of the ninth seasonal
    hour of the day. With the onset of the tenth hour, three hours before the beginning of the holiday, the Sages forbid eating any sort of baked goods, so
    that one's appetite is whet for the matza and festive meal of the Seder. If one is hungry during these hours, he may eat fruit, vegetables, meat, or fish,
    as long as he is careful to eat a small amount so that he will be hungry in the evening. If one is so sensitive that if he eats meat or some other food in
    the afternoon he will not be hungry at night, he must plan his meals on Erev Pesah so that he has an appetite when he eats the matza that evening (SA
    471:1-2).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. Baking Matza and Reciting <em>Seder Korban Pesah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Some practice the enhancement of baking the <em>matzot</em> to be used for the Seder night mitzva after midday on the fourteenth of Nisan, at the time of
    day when the Paschal sacrifice would be offered (SA 458:1). Many do not do so because it is labor intensive and this is the time when people are usually
    busy preparing the house for the Seder. Some <em>poskim</em> say that the possibility of the dough becoming <em>hametz </em>also makes it preferable to
    bake the matza beforehand, because some authorities are of the opinion that, at this time of day, even a drop of <em>hametz</em> renders everything
    forbidden, whereas if a drop of dough becomes <em>hametz </em>before midday, it is <em>batel be-shishim</em> and it will not "reawaken" later with the
onset of Pesah<em> </em>(MB 458:3; see above ch. 7 n. 1). Indeed, Rav Kook's custom was not to bake matza on Erev Pesah after midday (<em>Mo'adei</em>    <em>Ha-Re'aya</em> p. 284).
</p>
<p>
    After the <em>minha </em>prayer on Erev Pesah, people customarily recite the <em>seder korban Pesah</em>, a description of the procedure of offering the
    Paschal sacrifice, including relevant biblical verses. The Sages teach (<em>Megilla</em> 31b) that after the destruction of the Temple, reciting and
    studying the sacrificial procedures are considered a substitute for the <em>korban</em> itself.
</p>
<p>
    Maharal of Prague (<em>Gevurot Hashem</em> chs. 36, 37) explains that the significance of the Paschal sacrifice lies in the expression it gives to the
    unity of the Creator, and consequently the unity of Israel, whose purpose it is to reveal His name in the world. It is therefore eaten in groups, whose
    membership is predetermined, so that the <em>korban</em> is offered by a group of people who have united for this purpose. It is also forbidden to go from
    one group to another during the Seder, because this would disrupt the unity of the group. The offering is eaten with matza and <em>maror</em> in order to
    express the inner unity of all of the values alluded to by Paschal sacrifice, matza, and <em>maror</em>. We are commanded to roast the Paschal sacrifice
    because roasting solidifies and unifies the meat. It is forbidden to break any of its bones, because breaking is an expression of division.
</p>
<p>
    When the Paschal sacrifice cannot be offered, the unity of the Creator is not revealed in the world, and the people of Israel are scattered and divided.
    May it be God<em>'s</em> will that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and that we merit to offer the Paschal sacrifice together, as in the days of
    yore.

. The "<em>korban"</em> reason is explained in <em>y. Pesahim </em>4:1 and is the opinion of <em>Tosafot, </em>Rambam<em>, </em>and most            <em>poskim</em>. <em>Tosafot </em>implies that this prohibition is biblical in nature, but according to Rambam and many other <em>poskim</em>, the
            prohibition is rabbinic. All agree that after the destruction of the Temple the prohibition is only rabbinic. The first reason is the primary one;
            therefore, if the first night of Pesah coincides with <em>Motza'ei </em>Shabbat, one may work until <em>minha ketana</em> on Friday just like on a
regular week, even though he burns the <em>hametz</em> and takes care of other Pesah preparations on Friday (BHL<em> </em>468:1; see also<em>Hazon Ovadia</em> vol. 2 p. 82 and <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 14:8). The prohibition against work on Friday afternoon<em> </em>is explained in            <em>Pesahim</em> 50b, and the Rishonim are divided as to whether the prohibition refers to <em>minha gedola</em> (5.5 seasonal hours before sunset)
            or <em>minha ketana</em> (2.5 seasonal hours before sunset). Because this constitutes a doubt about a rabbinic law, <em>halakha</em> follows the
            lenient opinion (see SA 251:1 and MB <em>ad loc.</em>;<em> Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em> 2:8).
        </p>
        <p>
            See MB<em> </em>468:12 and <em>Kaf Ha-hayim </em>32 <em>ad loc.</em> regarding the modern day custom regarding Erev Pesah before midday. The fact
            that they wonder about the custom in Jerusalem makes it clear that there is no fixed custom to prohibit work, since where work is prohibited, it is
            also prohibited for guests, and certainly for the residents of the community. There are no communities nowadays that prohibit work on Erev Pesah
            before midday.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            However, according to SA 468:5 in the name of Rambam<em>, </em>even where there is no custom to prohibit work, only three types of craftsmen are
            permitted to begin working before midday: tailors, barbers, and launderers, since their work is done expressly for the holiday. For everyone else,
            if one began a task before the morning of the fourteenth and the work is necessary for Pesah, he may work until midday, but if he did not begin
before the morning of the fourteenth, he may not start. According to Rema, based on the opinion of most Rishonim, including Rashi<em>, </em>Raavad<em>, </em>Rosh<em>, </em>Ran, and others, the aforementioned distinction only applies where the custom is to refrain from work (like in Rema            <em>'s</em> community), but where the custom is to permit work until midday (like in our communities), everything is permissible. This is the
            custom of the Ashkenazic communities. Even some Sephardic communities follow Rema; see <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>32. In any event, we
            follow the lenient view when there is uncertainty regarding a rabbinic law.

it. In this regard, Erev Pesah is less strict than <em>Hol Ha-mo'ed</em>, since according to SHT 541:21 this type of work is prohibited on            <em>Hol Ha-mo'ed</em> but permitted on Erev Pesah as it is on Friday after <em>minha ketana</em>. However, SAH rules stringently on this matter
            vis-a-vis Erev Pesah as well.

. MB<em> </em>468:5 states that preferably one should cut his nails before midday, although many permit one to cut his nails even on            <em>Hol Ha-mo'ed </em>(SA<em> </em>�532 and <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> vol. 2 pp. 89-91). <em>She'arim Metzuyanim Be-halakha</em> 113:6 also permits
            polishing shoes. According to R. Mordechai Eliyahu (<em>Kitzur </em>SA 113:5), one may shave even after midday, although it is better to shave
            before midday.

            If one forgot to get a haircut before midday and his appearance is not appropriate for the holiday, he may get his hair cut by a gentile, since the
            ban on work applies only to Jews. Even though the Jew getting his hair cut helps the gentile do his job, it is permissible so that he will have his
            hair cut for the festival.

            . <em>Y. Pesahim </em>10:1 has two versions of this. According to one version, the custom of the firstborns is to fast on Erev Pesah; this also
            appears in <em>Sofrim</em> 21:3 (compiled at the end of the savoraic period in Eretz Yisrael). This is also the version quoted by Ramban<em> </em>
            and<em> </em>Ran<em>.</em> According to the second version of the Yerushalmi, they did not have the custom to fast; this is the version quoted by
            Raavya and is also the opinion of the Vilna Gaon<em>.</em> Me'iri states that the custom in Germany and France was to fast, although the fast was
not mandatory, and <em>Birkei Yosef</em> quotes Rishonim who echo this idea. Therefore, one may be lenient about this fast and rely on a            <em>siyum</em> in order to eat. <em>Mordechai</em> states in the name of Rabbeinu Yehiel that the custom of the firstborns is only to refrain from
            eating bread and other baked goods, but meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, and the like are permissible. Practically, SA<em> </em>470:1 states that
            the custom is to fast. However, MB<em> </em>2, SHT<em> </em>6 <em>ad loc. </em>state that when necessary, such as if the firstborn has great
difficulty fasting, one may rely on Rabbeinu Yehiel. The book <em>Ta'anit Bekhorot</em> discusses all of the opinions and laws in this matter; see            <em>Yabi'a Omer</em> 1:25 for a shorter summary.

            . As mentioned in the previous note, this custom is universally accepted. Even according to the opinions that this is a binding custom, it is still
            of rabbinic origin, so one may be lenient. This is especially true since there are authorities, Gra among them, who maintain that this custom is
            not binding at all. There is certainly room to be lenient when observing this custom conflicts with fulfilling the <em>mitzvot</em><em> </em>of the
            Seder, as is the case nowadays when most people are not accustomed to fasting (<em>Responsa</em> <em>Olat Shmuel</em> �28). Therefore, our custom
is to rely on a <em>siyum</em>, which in turn reminds firstborns that they are inherently holy and have great responsibilities.            <em>Arugot Ha-bosem</em> has a similar opinion in �139.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            A <em>siyum </em>on a book of Nevi'im is a <em>se'udat mitzva</em> (<em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 1:157). It seems that anyone who finishes one of the
            four sections of <em>Shulhan Arukh </em>or an important book can also make a <em>se'udat mitzva</em>, since making a <em>siyum</em> was never
            essentially limited just to a tractate of the Bavli; see <em>Havot Ya'ir</em> �70. Someone who completes one tractate of Mishna with commentaries
            can make a <em>siyum</em> for himself, but it would not exempt others (<em>Yabi'a Omer </em>OH 26; see also <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 470:9).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            In sum, a <em>siyum </em>on a significant work exempts all participants from fasting. When the <em>siyum</em> is on a work that is significant to
            the one who studied it but not so significant in the eyes of the public, the one who makes the <em>siyum</em> can make a <em>se'udat mitzva</em>
            and exempt himself from fasting. Thus, one who is just beginning to study Torah and has difficulty learning a tractate of Mishna in depth may make
a <em>siyum </em>on completing a superficial study of a tractate of Mishna or a book from Tanakh, but others are not exempted from fasting by his            <em>siyum </em>and <em>se'uda</em>.

            . Let us briefly summarize the opinions: According to Rosh and <em>Ha-ma'or</em><em>, </em>the prohibition begins at midday. According to Maharam
Halawa,<em> Tashbetz, </em>and Rambam in <em>Magid Mishneh</em>'s reading,<em> </em>the prohibition begins at dawn<em>.</em> According to            <em>Orhot Hayim</em>, the prohibition begins at from the time of <em>bedikat hametz</em> on the night of the fourteenth. Rema rules that the
            prohibition begins at dawn, and this is the opinion of most Aharonim. However, <em>Ben Ish Hai</em> (Tzav 26) states that the prohibition begins on
            the night of the fourteenth (see <em>Birur Halakha </em>99b).

            . Some authorities maintain that any matza that is not fit for the mitzva is permissible on Erev Pesah; this is the opinion of Me'iri<em>, </em>R.
            Yeshaya di Trani (Rid), and Rivash. Others maintain that anything that has the taste of matza is forbidden on Erev Pesah, even if it is unfit for
the mitzva. This position can be imputed to several Rishonim who permitted only egg matza (Rabbeinu Tam in <em>Tosafot</em> on <em>Pesahim</em><em> </em>99b, Rosh<em>, Mordechai, Tashbetz, </em>and Maharsha). In practice, however, the custom is to follow Rema and refrain from eating            <em>matza ashira</em><em>.</em> If one crumbles the matza and kneads it with oil or something sweet, whether he bakes it or not, there are some who
maintain that as long as the <em>berakha</em> is "<em>ha-motzi,</em>" the mixture is forbidden, but if the <em>berakha </em>becomes "            <em>mezonot"</em> it is permissible (SA<em> </em>168:10). According to the stringent opinions, including <em>Olat Re'iyah</em> (vol. 2 p. 243 �22),
any baked matza meal is forbidden on Erev Pesah, since any products made from matza meal would still require the <em>berakha</em> of            <em>ha-motzi</em> if eaten in the requisite quantities (they have the status of "<em>pat ha-ba'ah be-kisnin</em>"). If one cooked the matza meal,
            even if the cooked dish still requires <em>berakha</em> of <em>ha-motzi</em> if eaten in the requisite quantities, he may eat in on Erev Pesah
since its taste has changed. This is the opinion of MB 471:20 and SHT 19 <em>ad loc</em>. Some authorities are stringent; see below 14:1 and<em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 1:91, n. 10. Nonetheless, all agree that one may eat less than a <em>kezayit</em> of cooked matza, as I wrote above. See            <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 3:26, which allows hospitals to serve non-<em>shmura </em>matza on Erev Pesah in extenuating circumstances, since in these
            types of situations we can rely on the Rishonim who maintain that only matza that is fit for the mitzva is forbidden on Erev Pesah. Practically,
            however, this does not apply, since all <em>matzot</em> nowadays are guarded at least from the time of grinding, are made for the purpose of
            fulfilling the mitzva, and are thus acceptable to fulfill the mitzva (SA 453:4).
