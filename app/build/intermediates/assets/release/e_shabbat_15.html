1. The Principles of <em>Boneh</em>, <em>Soter</em>, and        <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Boneh</em> (building) is the        <em>melakha </em>through which the <em>Mishkan</em><em> </em>was
        constructed. The <em>melakha </em>includes leveling the ground in
        preparation for erecting the <em>Mishkan </em>upon it and so that
        people can walk easily in its courtyard. It also includes putting up
        the walls of the <em>Mishkan</em>, its roofing, and its courtyard gate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Building anything on the ground or in a house, or adding anything onto
        a pre-existing structure, is a transgression of a Torah prohibition.
        Therefore, if one fills in a small hole in a wall or a yard, adds
        cement or plaster to a wall, or adds water to freshly poured concrete
        to strengthen it (a process known as curing), he has transgressed a
        Torah prohibition (<em>Shabbat</em> 102b; 73b).
    </p>
    <p>
        Any activity that is forbidden on account of <em>Boneh</em> may not be
        undone, on account of the <em>melakha </em>of <em>Soter </em>
        (demolishing), assuming that there is a purpose to the demolition. If
        the act of undoing is destructive, it is rabbinically prohibited.
        Examples of purposeful demolition include destroying something in order
        to rebuild it more effectively, digging a hole in the ground in order
        to lay foundations, or drilling a hole in a wall in order to insert a
        screw (<em>Shabbat</em> 31b; MT 10:15).
    </p>
    <p>
        At times, demolition may be purposeful in itself. In such cases, even
if there is no intention to build, one still transgresses        <em>Boneh</em>. Examples of this include removing extra cement that is
        stuck on the floor or wall, digging a hole in order to hide things in
it, or creating a hole in a wall in order to conceal things there (        <em>Shabbat</em> 102b).
    </p>
    <p>
An additional <em>melakha</em> connected to building is        <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em> (applying the finishing touch). For example,
        after completing the construction of a house, sometimes there are
        stones protruding from the wall. They are then often hammered down to
        make the wall’s surface uniform. Similarly, after completing the
        manufacture of a metal tool, there are sometimes rough edges remaining
        that are smoothed out using a hammer. Both of these actions are
        prohibited on account of <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>. <em>Toladot</em> of
        this <em>melakha</em> include fixing broken tools, improving tools
        whose manufacture is complete, and installing a window to allow air to
        circulate and light to enter (MT 10:16). There are different opinions
        in the Gemara regarding whether certain construction-related activities
are prohibited on account of <em>Boneh</em> or on account of        <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 102b). We will not explore
        these types of disagreements, since the primary purpose of this work is
        to teach people what is permitted and prohibited rabbinically and by
        Torah law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Making cheese on Shabbat is prohibited by Torah law because it causes
        component parts to solidify and coalesce, in the manner of construction
        (MT 7:6). Making snowballs or snowmen is also prohibited; but since
        these do not last, the prohibition is rabbinic.
    </p>

        2. <em>Boneh </em>on the Ground, and Safeguards against it
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, <em>Boneh</em> includes the prohibition of leveling
        the ground, whether in order to make it easier to walk on, enable
        chairs and benches to be placed upon it, or to build upon it.
        Therefore, one who levels a mound of earth or fills in a hole
        transgresses a Torah prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a yard was flooded by rain, one may not spread sand or gravel over
        it in order to cover the mud. Since those materials are normally left
in the ground, this is considered leveling the ground, a violation of        <em>Boneh</em>. However, one may spread straw that is designated for
        animal food over the mud, since he does not intend to leave it there.
        This is on condition that the straw is spread with a <em>shinui</em>,
        such as using the back of a shovel to distribute it. Otherwise, the act
        of spreading looks like a weekday activity (<em>Eruvin</em> 104a; SA
        313:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may cover excrement or saliva with sand, since one who does this
does not intend to improve the yard, but only to cover the filth (        <em>Beitza</em> 8b; MB 313:55). Similarly, if oil spilled on the
        sidewalk or the floor, one may cover it with sand to prevent people
        from slipping. This is on condition that the sand was designated for
        this purpose and thus is not <em>muktzeh</em> (below 23:3). One may
        similarly spread salt on ice in order to prevent people from slipping
        (SSK 25:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not sweep the yard lest he level indentations and thereby
        transgress a Torah prohibition. However, if the yard is floored with
        tiles or pavement, he may sweep it.

    </p>
    <p>
        One who has clay stuck to his shoes should not try to rub it off
        against the ground, because he may end up leveling the ground (SA
        302:6). Some are not worried about this possibility, and permit rubbing
        off the clay (Rema, <em>Taz</em>). One who so wishes may be lenient,
        but it is preferable to be stringent. In contrast, one may rub off the
        clay against a grate, tiles, or stones even <em>le-khatĥila</em> (MB
        302:28).
    </p>
    <p>
        One should not rub saliva that is on the ground into the dirt with
        one’s shoes, to avoid leveling the ground. If one finds the saliva
        disgusting, he may step on it in the natural course of his walking, as
        long as his intention is not to spread it and level the ground (SA
        316:11).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not play marbles on the ground lest he level the ground so that
        the marbles roll smoothly. Similarly, one may not play any game on the
        ground that requires completely flat ground, lest he end up leveling
        it. Even if the ground is paved, one may not play there, as there is a
        concern that one might then end up playing on unpaved ground (SA 338:5
        and MB <em>ad loc</em>. 20; MB 308:158). However, one may play on the
        floor inside one’s home; since all homes today have flooring, we are
        not worried that, as a result of playing there, anyone will end up
        playing outside on unpaved ground (SSK 16:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        Children may play in a sandbox containing fine, dry sand, for as long
        as the sand is dry, the sand will pour back into any indentations made.
        However, if the sand is wet enough to make holes in it, one may not to
        play with it (MB 308:143). Wetting the sand is also forbidden, as it
        constitutes <em>Lash</em> (MB 321:50). If the sand has not been
        designated for play it is <em>muktzeh</em>, and thus playing with it is
        forbidden (SA 308:38; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 144).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Attaching Things to a House or the Ground
    </h2>
    <p>
        Permanently affixing something useful to a house or the ground violates
        the Torah prohibition of <em>Boneh</em>. Removing such fixtures
        violates the Torah prohibition of <em>Soter</em>. This is the case even
        if the attachment is not tight and the objects can easily be detached
        and reattached, as is the case with hinged or sliding windows or doors.
        Since these are permanently attached to the house, they become part of
        it, and installing them or removing them is a transgression of a Torah
        prohibition. Therefore, even if a room is hot, one may not remove a
        window from the wall or from its frame (<em>Shabbat</em> 122b; SA
        308:9; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 39). Similarly, one may not attach or detach
        a filter that is screwed onto a faucet, rubber pipes attached to the
        sink, or light bulbs screwed into their sockets, since their attachment
        to the house is permanent. Similarly, pounding a nail into the wall or
        gluing a hook to the wall violates a Torah prohibition, since these
        additions are permanent (<em>Shabbat</em> 103a; MB 314:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may similarly not attach curtain hooks to a curtain track or the
        curtains themselves to the hooks on the track. Fastening a curtain rod
        to brackets that protrude from the wall is also prohibited. Even though
        all these attachments are loose, since the items are being attached to
        the building, these actions are prohibited by Torah law. If the rod is
        not truly attached to the brackets, but rather simply rests upon or
        inside them and can move back and forth easily, then the rod may be
        placed on the brackets. In such a case, one may also thread the loops
        at the top of the curtain through the rod.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the object being attached to the house or the ground will not last
        long, the prohibition is rabbinic. For example, it is only rabbinically
        forbidden to attach a vacuum hook to a wall, since its suction cup will
        not keep the hook anchored for long.
    </p>
    <p>
        When something may not be attached to the ground or a house, it is also
        forbidden to tighten its existing attachment. Therefore, one may not
        tighten the loose screws of a sink, door handle, or closet handle.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, objects that are not really attached and do not become
        part of the house may be put up or taken down. For example, one may
        hang a picture on a nail, because the picture is not considered part of
        the wall. If a window breaks and cold wind is blowing through the
        house, the broken window may be covered with cloth to keep out the
        wind. This is because the cloth does not become part of the wall, but
        is placed there only temporarily (MB 313:3 and 315:7; SSK 23:41 and
        23:44). Similarly, one may stick papers to a refrigerator using
        magnets, because the magnets are not considered part of the
        refrigerator. For the same reason, one may hang a colander over the lip
        of the sink. Inserting a plug in a socket or removing it is also not
        considered <em>Boneh</em> or <em>Soter</em>, because the plug is not
        considered part of the house.
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is self-evident that one may open and close doors, windows, and
        faucets. This is the case even when the door is not usually opened, or
        when the faucet in question is the water main, which is rarely shut
        off. Since they remain attached to the building and this type of
        opening or closing is the way they are normally used, it is not
        considered <em>Boneh</em> or <em>Soter</em>. Similarly, one may open
        and close a porch’s sliding roof that is attached with hinges or that
        slides on a track, as it is considered the same as a window (Rema
        626:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is prohibited by Torah law to use a nail or a screw to reattach a
        door handle that has fallen off. Reattaching it without a nail or a
        screw in a way that joins the handles of both sides of the door to each
        other is rabbinically prohibited, since the attachment is only
        temporary. In contrast, one may insert one of the two handles into the
        door without using nails or screws. This is not considered an
        attachment at all, since the handle is just resting there with nothing
        to support it. However, there is still a concern that one might forget
        that it is Shabbat and decide to reattach it properly with nails.
        Therefore, the door handle should be replaced awkwardly, tilted upward
        or downward, so there is no concern that anyone will tighten the
        connection. A handle that has begun to come loose from its attachment
        to the corresponding handle may not be pushed back into place.

        4. Making a Tent (<em>Ohel</em>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Making an <em>ohel</em><em> </em>is a <em>tolada</em> of <em>Boneh</em>
        . In contrast to the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Boneh</em>, which involves
        attaching different components, such as stone, wood, cement, and metal,
        to construct a house or implement, making an <em>ohel </em>does not
        involve the attachment of various components but the erection of
        something that separates between different areas. The roof of a tent
        serves as a barrier between the sky and those who are inside the tent,
        protecting them from the elements. Therefore, pitching a tent on
        Shabbat using sheets or other things that are not considered
        construction materials is prohibited by Torah law if the tent is stable
        and will last for a long time (at least eight days). This is the case
        even if one tied no knots and used no screws or nails, but only loops
and pegs. Even if he only made a roof or a wall, or even simply added a        <em>tefaĥ </em>to an existing roof or wall, he has transgressed a Torah
prohibition (<em>Pri Megadim</em>, <em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 315:8; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 1; SHT <em>ad loc</em>. 6).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition is limited to a permanent, durable <em>ohel</em>.
        The Sages further forbid making a temporary <em>ohel</em>. Therefore,
        one may not spread a curtain or netting over a bed, whether for privacy
        or for protection against insects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the critical part of an <em>ohel</em> is the roof, one may not
        make any sort of temporary roof to protect a person beneath it, even if
it is only a <em>tefaĥ</em> wide. But one may put up a temporary        <em>meĥitza</em>. For example, one may erect a <em>meĥitza</em> between
men and women attending a Torah lecture. However, one may not erect a        <em>meĥitza</em> that serves to render something halakhically permitted
        (<em>meĥitza ha-materet</em>) even on a temporary basis. For example,
        if a <em>sukka</em> has only two walls, a third wall may not be
        erected, even if it is temporary, since erecting this <em>meĥitza</em>
        renders the <em>sukka</em> kosher. Similarly, one may not erect a
        temporary <em>meĥitza</em> in order to close a gap in an <em>eruv</em>,
        because this renders the <em>eruv</em> kosher (SA 315:1; below 29:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        The rabbinic prohibition of making a temporary <em>ohel</em> is limited
        to the case of a new <em>ohel</em>, but one may make a temporary
        addition to a pre-existing <em>ohel</em>. Therefore, one who wishes to
        spread an awning in his garden on Shabbat to protect himself from the
        sun should make sure to spread it at least a <em>tefaĥ</em> before
        Shabbat. He may then extend it fully on Shabbat. Similarly, if the
        beginning of a permanent roof is already in place, one may put up an
        awning to serve as a temporary continuation of the roof. One may also
take down whatever was temporarily added on Shabbat (SA 315:2; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 38).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if no one had actually begun to spread out the awning before
        Shabbat, but it contains a pull-string that is designed for extending
        it, this string is considered the beginning of the extension, and thus
        one may complete the extension of the awning on Shabbat (MB 315:37).
    </p>
    <p>
        A porch’s sliding roof that is attached with hinges or that slides on a
        track may be opened and closed on Shabbat. This is because it is not
        considered an <em>ohel</em>, but rather is comparable to opening and
        closing a door (Rema 626:3). Similarly, one may open a patio umbrella
        that is permanently affixed in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hinged hood or canopy of a baby carriage or stroller may be opened
        and closed on Shabbat. Furthermore, since it may be opened, it is
        considered the beginning of an <em>ohel</em>, and one may add to it as
        well. Thus, if one wishes to protect more of the carriage by extending
        the hood using a cloth diaper or a plastic sheet, he may do so (SSK
        24:13).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Additional Laws Pertaining <em>Ohel</em> <em></em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, making even a temporary <em>ohel</em> is rabbinically
        prohibited. Included in this prohibition is placing a wide board or a
        sheet across vertical supports to protect oneself from the elements.
        However, when the supports are not permanent, this can be permitted if
        the <em>ohel</em><em> </em>is erected in a manner that differs
        significantly from the normal way of doing it. The Sages forbade
        putting up a temporary <em>ohel</em> in the usual order - first putting
        up the walls or supports, and only then putting up the roof. However,
if the order is reversed, the Sages permit one to put up a temporary        <em>ohel</em>. Thus, if the roof is first held up in the air and then
        walls or supports are placed underneath it, this would be permitted.
        Usually a second person is necessary in order to erect a tent in this
way (<em>Shabbat</em> 43b; SA 311:6; <em>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</em>        <em>ad loc</em>.).
    </p>
    <p>
        These rules apply to children’s games as well. Children who are of an
        age where they can understand the laws of Shabbat may not spread
        blankets over chairs in order to create a tent in which to play, but
        they may hold the blanket in the air and then place chairs underneath
        it. Similarly, they may not use interlocking toy bricks (like Lego) to
        build a house or garage whose inside area is a square <em>tefaĥ</em> or
        more, but they may hold the roof up and then attach the walls from
        underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as one may not put up a temporary <em>ohel</em>, one may not take
        one down. Just as one may put up a temporary <em>ohel</em> if he
        changes the order of construction, so too he may take one down if he
        changes the order. The walls must be removed first, and only afterward
        the roof (SSK 24:22).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if there is no intention to erect an <em>ohel </em>in order to
        take shelter under it, nevertheless, if in actuality one makes
        something in the form of an <em>ohel</em><em> </em>and the space
        underneath serves a purpose, it may not be erected in that form. For
        example, one may not take two barrels of wine and place a third one
        across the top. Since it is necessary to have airflow between the
        barrels so that the wine will not get overheated and spoil, this
        structure is considered a temporary <em>ohel</em>: the two barrels are
        considered walls, and the barrel atop them is considered a roof.
        However, the Sages permit doing so if the order is reversed; one person
        may hold up the top barrel while someone else slips the other two
        barrels underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
One may place a tabletop on legs as long as each leg is less than a<em>tefaĥ</em> wide. In such a case, the legs are not considered        <em>meĥitzot</em>, and one may set the legs first and then place the
        tabletop on top of them. If each of the legs is a <em>tefaĥ</em> wide,
        they are considered <em>meĥitzot</em>. If one wishes to set up such a
        table, he must hold the tabletop in the air and then have someone else
        slip the legs underneath it.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
        In contrast, when opening a folding crib, one may place the board and
        mattress normally, as there are no walls beneath them and there is no
        purpose served by the space underneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may open a baby carriage or stroller, a folding table, a folding
        chair, a cot, or a playpen on Shabbat because the entire structure is
        already completed and connected before Shabbat. The only part that is
        done on Shabbat is opening it (SA 315:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not cover a very large barrel (whose diameter is close to a
        meter), as this resembles making an <em>ohel</em> if a <em>tefaĥ </em>
        of open space remains (<em>Shabbat </em>139b; SA 315:13). However, if
        the cover of the barrel has a handle on it, then it is clear that this
        is simply the cover of a receptacle and not the roof of a tent, and
        thus one may place it on top of the barrel (SSK ch. 24 n. 72). One may
        overturn a large pot and use it to cover food and protect it from the
sun or insects, because overturning a pot is not considered making an        <em>ohel</em>. Similarly, one may overturn a recliner or couch even
        though space is created underneath it, because overturning furniture is
        not considered making an <em>ohel</em> (BHL 315:5, s.v. "kisei").
    </p>
    <p>
        Many maintain that it is rabbinically forbidden to put on a hat with a
        hard brim a <em>tefaĥ</em> wide, because doing so is considered making
        a temporary <em>ohel</em>. This is despite the fact that one may use a
        hand fan to shield himself from the sun and hold a <em>talit</em>
        horizontally over one who is called up to the Torah in honor of his
        marriage. Nevertheless, a hat that remains on one’s head without moving
        is more similar to a temporary <em>ohel</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 138b;
        Rabbeinu Ĥananel; Rambam; SA 301:40). The custom, though, is to be
        lenient and to allow one to wear a black hat, since it is worn
        primarily for the sake of honor and not to provide shade. It is also
        possible that the brims of today’s hats are not considered hard (MB
        301:151). Alternatively, perhaps the custom relies on Rashi, who
        maintains that a hat is never comparable to an <em>ohel</em>; the only
        concern is that if one’s hat is blown off, people might chase after it
        and end up carrying it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The universal custom is to forbid using an umbrella on Shabbat because
        it resembles an <em>ohel</em> (see BHL 315:8, s.v. "tefaĥ"; SSK 24:15).

        6. Permitted and Prohibited Implements<em></em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as <em>Boneh</em> and <em>Soter</em> apply to building or
        demolishing a house, the ground, or an <em>ohel</em>, they also apply
        to building or demolishing an implement.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
        Therefore, one may not insert the handle of a hammer into the hammer
        head or a broom handle into the broom shaft. A permanent insertion is
        prohibited by Torah law, while a temporary insertion is forbidden
        rabbinically. Similarly, it is prohibited by Torah law to put together
        a bed or chair using nails, screws, or glue, since such attachments are
        full and permanent. Fixing a chair leg or table leg that has fallen off
        is also forbidden, as is attaching or removing a rubber chair tip or
        table tip (a rubber protector that goes underneath a chair leg or table
        leg).
    </p>
    <p>
        If there is a possibility that people will forget it is Shabbat and end
        up fixing the implement, the Sages forbid moving it. For example, if a
        leg falls off a chair or table, one may not move the item and prop it
        up on another piece of furniture, because someone might see it and
        decide to repair it. However, if the implement would be complicated to
        fix, or if it had already been used in this manner before Shabbat,
        there is no concern that he will forget and repair it on Shabbat, so it
        may be moved (SA 313:8; Rema 308:16; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 69; SSK
        20:44).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use implements on Shabbat whose normal usage involves screwing
        or unscrewing. Thus, one may screw a lid on a jar, salt shaker, or
        pressure cooker, put on jewelry whose ends screw together, or look
        through binoculars that are focused by turning a knob. Since this is
        the normal way of using these devices, screwing and unscrewing them is
        not considered a <em>melakha</em>. However, one may not unscrew
        something if it unusual to do so. For example, one may not unscrew the
        knob of a pot cover (SHT 313:32; MA<em> </em>states that the
        prohibition is by Torah law, while <em>Taz</em> maintains that it is
        rabbinic).
    </p>
    <p>
Most <em>poskim</em> allow adjusting the height of a lectern ("        <em>shtender</em>") by loosening a knob and tightening it at the
        desired height, as this is the normal usage and the lectern remains
        usable at every stage of the adjustment (<em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 8:9
citing R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv;        <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 314:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may adjust a baby carriage or stroller with hinges or latches from
        an upright position to a horizontal one and vice versa. However, if
        doing so involves removing screws that hold the seat in position and
        then screwing them back in, it is forbidden because it entails making a
        strong attachment that is adjusted only infrequently (SSK 28:50).
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Permissible Assembly and Disassembly of Implements
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is a difference between attaching things to a house and attaching
        things to an implement. One may not add anything to (or remove anything
        from) a house even if it is attached loosely, since the house is
        considered permanent. For example, one may not install a window on its
        hinges or remove it from its hinges. Although it is attached loosely
        and it is easy to make or break this attachment, it is forbidden
        because the window is part of the house. Note that if a wardrobe or
free-standing closet has a volume of forty <em>se’ah</em> (three cubic        <em>amot</em>, or just over ten cubic feet) it has the same status as a
        house. Thus, one may not connect anything to a large wardrobe, even
        loosely (Rema 314:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, devices, which are less permanent, may be assembled using
        temporary attachments that do not require craftsmanship or strength.
        Therefore, one may assemble and disassemble a portable cot of the type
        travelers use, which can be assembled and disassembled daily, and which
        is loosely attached (<em>Shabbat</em> 47a-b; SA 313:6). Similarly, one
        may remove the door of an implement<em> </em>that is easily assembled
        and disassembled and that turns easily on its hinges. Technically, one
        should be permitted to place this door on its hinges as well. However
        if the hinge is attached to the implement with nails or screws, the
        Sages forbid it out of concern lest one tighten the attachment and
        thereby transgress a Torah prohibition. Only if nothing can be
        tightened, such as if the hinge is part of the implement, may the door
        then be attached to the implement (<em>Shabbat</em> 122b; SA 308:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        The general principle here is that if an implement is normally
        assembled with a firm attachment, the Sages forbid even attaching it
        loosely. They were concerned that one might forget and attach it
        firmly, thus transgressing a Torah prohibition. However, if an
        implement is assembled with temporary and easy attachments, there is no
        reason to fear that one will attach it firmly and thus transgress a
        Torah prohibition, and it may be assembled and disassembled. Therefore,
        one may extend a table by adding a leaf designed for this purpose, and
        one may remove a leaf as well, since the leaves are clearly temporary.
        Similarly, the feeding tray on a child’s high chair, which is
        constantly attached and detached, may be used freely on Shabbat, since
        the attachment is loose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on this, many maintain that the prohibitions of <em>Boneh</em>
        and <em>Soter</em> do not apply to building with interlocking toy
        bricks (like Lego) and the like, since the pieces are attached to each
other temporarily and are designed to be disassembled (        <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:31; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:55; but SSK
        16:19 is stringent).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some Aĥaronim maintain that it is rabbinically forbidden to make paper
        airplanes or boats or to fold napkins into special shapes because this
        resembles <em>Boneh</em> (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach cited in SSK 11:41;
16:21). Others permit this on the basis that the prohibition of        <em>Boneh</em> does not apply to things that are temporary and will
        soon be disassembled (<em>Rivevot Ephraim</em> 1:223:8 quoting R. Moshe
        Feinstein). One who is lenient has an opinion to rely on, and one who
is stringent is commendable. Children may be lenient even        <em>le-khatĥila</em> (see <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. Fixing Broken Implements
    </h2>
    <p>
        Some items are sturdily assembled initially but loosen over time. If
        people are used to using these items in their loosened state, it is not
        prohibited to assemble or disassemble them. As noted, assembling
        implements loosely is not considered <em>Boneh</em>. Furthermore, since
        people are used to using them this way, we are not concerned that they
        will end up fixing them with nails or glue (see Rema 308:16; SA 313:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, if a wheel falls off a baby’s crib and people are comfortable
        using the crib after replacing the wheel loosely, it may be replaced.
        Similarly, rubber chair tips and table tips may be replaced if they are
        only loosely attached. This is also the case if the leg of a child’s
        doll has come off: if the leg is attached to the doll tightly, it may
        not be snapped back into place, but if it is connected loosely, it may
        be replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a temple fell off a pair of glasses, it may not be screwed back into
        place, since generally it is screwed on tightly. One may not even
        attach it loosely, because one may forget and tighten it, thus
        transgressing a Torah prohibition. However, if the screw is lost, there
        is no longer a concern that anyone will tighten it. Thus, one may
        reattach the temple using a safety pin, as this is a weak attachment
        that is permitted for implements (<em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 314:11:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a lens fell out of the glasses’ frame and replacing it requires
        screwing it back in, it may not be replaced at all, even if the screw
        is left loose. This is because we are concerned that later on one will
        forget and tighten it. But if there is no screw, but rather the frame
        has expanded a bit so that the lens sometimes falls out, then the lens
        may be replaced in the frame. We are not concerned that one will
permanently reattach it, as that would require expertise (        <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:23:35; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 8:49-50).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not straighten a spoon, knife, or glasses temple on Shabbat by
        hand, because this is considered <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em> (MA 340:11;
        MB 509:1, 7; see <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition of <em>Boneh</em> does not apply to compressing a
        spring on a toy car so that the car will move forward. One may do so as
        long as the car does not make noise or light up (see SSK 16:14).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may inflate an air mattress, air pillow, or rubber ball that had
        been previously inflated. Since this is permissible, it may be done in
        the usual fashion, using a manual pump. However, one may not inflate
these items for the first time on Shabbat, because many        <em>poskim </em>maintain that inflating them for the first time makes
        them into viable implements for the first time, which is prohibited.
        One may not blow up a balloon even if it had previously been inflated,
        lest one tie a knot at the bottom. However, if the balloon is sealed
        with a valve instead of a knot, and it had previously been inflated, it
        may be inflated on Shabbat (SSK 15:89; 16:7; 34:24).
    </p>
    <a name="9"></a><h2>
        9. Cleaning the Floor and Making Repairs
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the floor is dirty, and leaving it in such a state dishonors
        Shabbat, one may sweep the floor. A yard, though, may not be swept,
because one may end up leveling the ground and thus transgressing        <em>Boneh</em> (see section 2 above, n. 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, one may not wash the floor, since leaving the floor
        unwashed does not dishonor Shabbat as leaving it unswept does, and
        there is concern that one who washed an area with a hard floor will end
        up washing a dirt floor as well, which would involve leveling the
ground and thus transgressing <em>Boneh</em> (SA 337:3; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 3). However, if water spilled on the floor, one may
        remove the water using a squeegee (SSK 23:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a particular spot on the floor has become especially filthy, for
        example, if juice spilled on it, one may pour a bit of water on it and
        then either wipe it away with a squeegee or soak it up with something
        that would not normally be wrung out (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach cited
        in SSK ch. 23 n. 30; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 337:2). If the entire floor
        is filthy, one who is lenient and pours water on it and wipes it away
with a squeegee has an opinion upon which to rely (        <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 43:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        If clumps of grass are blocking a drainage pipe, causing water to back
        up onto the roof and leak into the house, the Sages permit stepping on
        the clump to break up and remove the blockage. Normally, even fixing
        something with a <em>shinui</em> is rabbinically prohibited, but in
this case, where otherwise a loss will be incurred, the Sages permit (        <em>Ketubot</em> 60a; SA 336:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on this, some prohibit unclogging a sink using a plunger. They
maintain that the Sages permit removing blockages only if a        <em>shinui</em> is used, but using a plunger to break up a blockage is
        the normal way to deal with this problem. Thus it is forbidden by Torah
law, and even in a time of need one may not be lenient (        <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 5:33; R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv). In contrast,
        others permit this, maintaining that a blockage that can be broken up
        using a plunger is not a total blockage, and thus breaking it up is not
        considered a true repair. Furthermore, the improvement that is made is
        not to the pipe itself. Rather, one is simply dislodging the sludge
        that clogged it (<em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 5:75; R. Shlomo Zalman
        Auerbach cited in SSK 12:18; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:24:29). In
        practice, in a case of need, it is proper for two people to hold the
        plunger and unclog the drain together. This way, even according to the
        stringent opinion, the prohibition would only be rabbinic; and when in
        doubt about a rabbinic mitzva, the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient
        position. (See above 9:3 and n. 1.)
    </p>
    <p>
        All agree that one may not remove a blockage using professional
        equipment like a plumber’s snake. It is also forbidden by Torah law to
        take apart the pipe under the sink in order to empty it of sludge and
        then reassemble it.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may remove garbage that accumulates in the sink strainer. It is not
        necessary to do this with a <em>shinui</em>, because this action does
        not fix anything; one is simply removing filth (SA 308:34; SSK 12:17;
        below 22:12).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not oil a door’s squeaky hinge or a baby carriage’s wheel, as
        this is considered a repair (SSK 23:43; 28:53). If pantyhose start to
        tear (or "run"), one may not put nail polish or soap at the tip of the
        run to prevent further ripping, because this reinforces the hose (SSK
        15:77).
    </p>
    <a name="10"></a><h2>
        10. <em>Meĥatekh</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>melakha </em>of <em>Meĥatekh</em> is instrumental in
        transforming raw material into houses, implements, clothing, etc. For
        example, if one wishes to make leather clothing, he must first cut the
        leather to the right size. If one wishes to build a house, he must cut
        the stones, metal, and panels to the right size. If one wishes to
        install a window, he must cut the glass to the right size. The general
        principle is that one who cuts something to a specific size on Shabbat
        transgresses the Torah prohibition of <em>Meĥatekh</em>. Similarly, it
        is forbidden by Torah law to cut off the soft part of feathers in order
        to make pillows and blankets, since one must cut precisely between the
        hard and soft sections (<em>Shabbat</em> 74b). This is the distinction
between <em>Meĥatekh</em> and <em>Kore’a</em>: the primary purpose of        <em>Kore’a</em> is to separate two distinct parts, whereas the primary
        purpose of <em>Meĥatekh</em> is to cut with precision in order to
        create something new.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Meĥatekh</em> does not apply to foods.
        Therefore one may cut a cake into equal-sized pieces. Similarly, one
        may cut grooves into an orange in order to peel it. Pills and
        suppositories used by sick people are also considered food for this
        purpose, and may be cut where scored (SSK 33:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        Items that animals would consume are considered food and thus not
        subject to <em>Meĥatekh</em>. Therefore, one may use a knife to cut
        straw or hay to use as a toothpick. However, one may not fashion a
        toothpick from hard wood. Since it is inedible to animals, cutting it
        to size constitutes <em>Meĥatekh</em>: if by means of a tool, one
violates a Torah prohibition, and if by hand, which is considered a        <em>shinui</em>, a rabbinic prohibition (<em>Beitza</em> 33a-b; MT
        11:7; SA 322:4; MB 322:13, 18).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may take fragrant branches of hard wood that were harvested before
        Shabbat and trim or rub them so that their aroma spreads. One may also
        break them into smaller pieces so that more people can smell them. Even
        though the branches are hard and animals would not eat them, one may
        break them, since the size of the pieces does not matter. One may only
        do so on condition that they are broken by hand. If he uses a tool, we
        are concerned that he will forget and fashion a toothpick, thus
        transgressing Torah law (<em>Beitza</em>, <em>loc. cit</em>.; SA 322:5;
        MB <em>ad loc</em>. 17-18; Rema 336:8).
    </p>
    <a name="11"></a><h2>
        11. Opening Cans
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may open cans on Shabbat in order to eat the food inside them.
        Since cans are disposable and meant for single use, they are not
        considered true receptacles and are more akin to shells that are broken
        to get at the nut within.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, we read in the Mishna: "One may break a barrel in order to
        eat the dried figs inside it, as long as he does not intend to create a
receptacle" (<em>Shabbat</em> 146a). Many explain that this        <em>mishna</em> refers to a <em>mustekei</em>, an inferior sort of
        barrel meant for a single use. Because the barrel was unimportant, it
        was secondary to the food inside it, just as a nutshell is secondary to
        the nut inside it. Thus, one may break the barrel in order to eat its
        figs. They would not break the barrel in a way that scatters the figs;
        rather they would break off the top, and the figs would remain within
        for several days, until they were all eaten. The Sages did make one
        condition: "As long as he does not intend to create a receptacle." If
        one makes a neat opening and plans to reuse the barrel to store other
        things, then he is truly creating a receptacle when he opens it, and is
        thus transgressing<em> </em>(SA 314:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The same applies to cans. One may open them on Shabbat if one plans to
        eat their contents, even if it will take several days to finish the
        food. Once the food is finished, the can is thrown out; therefore it is
        considered unimportant and may be opened on Shabbat. However, one who
        intends to reuse the can for other items may not open the can on
        Shabbat, since he is creating an opening and rendering it usable, which
        amounts to creating a receptacle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are stringent and do not open cans on Shabbat even when they
        intend to throw them out. Since the can is in fact capable of storing
        additional items, creating an opening for it essentially makes it into
a receptacle (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 51:11). However, in practice the        <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient position. Since we are dealing
        with cans and containers that are designed to be disposable, it is not
        forbidden to open them. Those who wish to be stringent should open cans
        before Shabbat. If they need to open a can on Shabbat, they should
        immediately empty it of its contents.

        12. Opening Bags and Wrappers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Many dairy products are sold in plastic containers. One may peel the
        cover of such a plastic container. Similarly, packages of wafers and
        chocolate bars may be opened. Since the wrapper is meant to be
        disposable, it is secondary to the food inside it, just as an orange
        peel is secondary to the orange and may be removed in order to eat the
        orange.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may make a hole in the top of a bag of milk or juice in order to
        pour out the liquid, open the top of a bag of sugar that is glued shut,
        and rip open bags of candies or other foods.
    </p>
    <p>
Similarly, we find that the Sages permitted cutting open        <em>ĥotalot</em> (palm leaves used to protect unripe dates) on Shabbat.
        They permitted this because these leaves lacked importance, as they
        were considered entirely secondary to the dates inside them, similar to
        an orange peel. (<em>Shabbat</em> 146a; <em>Kol Bo</em>; SA 314:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are stringent and do not open bags or packages if the food will
        remain inside for a while, as is the case with a bag of sugar. They
        maintain that one who makes a neat opening is not ruining the bag, but
        rather is creating a receptacle (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 51:10). According
        to this approach, the only way to open such bags is to tear them apart
        entirely and transfer their contents to a different container.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient position, because
        these bags have no importance and are thrown out after the food they
        contain is finished. Therefore, one may open them in whatever way
        enables easy removal of their contents, and he may use them until the
        food inside is used up.
        <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        It should also be mentioned that when opening these bags, one should
        try not to tear any letters. However, if necessary, one may open the
        bag even if it is clear that doing so will tear letters (as explained

    <p>
        Similarly, one may open packages that contain items that are necessary
        for Shabbat, such as tissues and diapers. It is proper to open them
        more messily than one would during the week. Those who follow the
        stringent opinion would need to destroy the packaging so that it can no
        longer hold its original contents. The <em>halakha</em> is in
        accordance with those who are lenient.

        13. Opening Bottles
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Poskim</em>
        disagree about whether one may open a wine bottle that has a metal
        screw cap. Some prohibit opening it, maintaining that before the bottle
        is opened, the cap is simply a cover, but after it is opened and
        separated from the little metal rim that is left behind on the bottle,
        it becomes an implement, because it has become a screw cap that aids in
        opening and closing the bottle (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, most <em>poskim</em> are not concerned about opening such a
        cap. They maintain that even before it is opened it is already
        considered a bottle cap. Opening it does not create a new entity.
        Separating the metal rim from the cap is comparable to cracking open a
        nutshell in order to eat the nut. Additionally, the one who opens the
        bottle has no intention of making an implement; he just wants to open
        the bottle. Even though it happens to be that a screw cap is created,
        there is no prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although one who wishes may be lenient may do so, and there are many
        who are lenient in practice, <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is preferable to
        defer to the stringent opinion and open such a bottle before Shabbat.
        An additional solution is to keep around old bottle caps and then
        immediately throw out the new cap after opening a bottle on Shabbat.
        Since in this case there is no intention to use the bottle cap that was
        opened on Shabbat, even those who are stringent would concede that one
        may open it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If no old bottle cap is available and a bottle was not opened before
        Shabbat, another solution for those who are stringent is to puncture
        the bottle cap before opening it. This effectively ruins the bottle cap
        so that after it is opened it is not considered an implement (SSK
        9:18). According to those who are lenient, it is preferable to open the
        cap without puncturing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even most of those who are stringent regarding a metal bottle cap
        maintain that a plastic cap may be opened, as this is considered a
        bottle cap even before it is opened. Thus, opening a plastic bottle cap
        does not make it an implement (SSK 9:21). This is the custom. One may
        also use a corkscrew to remove a cork on Shabbat.

        14. Opening Soda Cans and Separating Attached Plastic Containers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Some forbid opening a pop-top can on Shabbat. They are concerned that
        this action may constitute <em>Boneh</em>, because it creates a neat
        opening that allows one to drink. They are also concerned that one may
        be transgressing <em>Meĥatekh</em>, because the tab is pre-scored and
        produces a very precise opening.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, many permit this, maintaining that because the can is meant to
        be disposable, opening the top does not create a receptacle. Rather, it
        is comparable to breaking a barrel in order to remove the wine inside
        it. <em>Meĥatekh</em> is also not an issue, because that applies only
        when material must be cut to an exact size. Since it does not matter
        where a cut is made on the can, and the only goal is to create an
        opening for drinking, the can may be opened in the most convenient way
        possible - by lifting the tab.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may be lenient if he wishes. If one wishes to be stringent, he
        should not drink from the opening formed by popping the top, but rather
        should pour the drink from the can into his cup. This makes it clear
        that he is not interested in the neat opening of the can. If one wishes
        to be more stringent, he should be careful to lift the tab only
        slightly, less than he would on a weekday. This way the act of cutting
        is not completed, and the opening is not as good as it is usually.
        <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is another case that is subject to debate. Many dairy products
        (yogurts, puddings, and the like) come in containers that are loosely
        connected to each other. May one separate them by applying light
        pressure to that connection?
    </p>
    <p>
        Some maintain that breaking the containers apart along score lines that
are made for this purpose is a violation of the Torah prohibition of<em>Meĥatekh</em>. They are also concerned that this might be        <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>, since separating the containers makes them
        usable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others are lenient, maintaining that cutting is forbidden only when it
        is precise, and here the goal is simply to separate the containers from
        one another. No one cares exactly how precise the cut is. Furthermore,
        it is not <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>, since the containers were
        completely ready for use even beforehand. Separating them simply
        removes an external impediment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, one who wishes to be lenient has an opinion to rely upon,
        and one who chooses to be stringent should be commended. It is proper
        to separate such containers before Shabbat.

            Rif maintains that one may sweep the unfloored ground because one
            will not necessarily level the ground, and thus if one does so it
            is unintentional, a <em>davar she-eino mitkaven</em>. Rambam
            permits sweeping an area that is floored. However, if it is
            unfloored, he is concerned that one might intend to level the
            ground. Rosh maintains that even a floored area may not be swept
            because one may come to sweep an unfloored area and level the
            ground. SA 337:2 rules in accordance with Rambam, while Rema
            follows Rosh. However, BHL s.v. "ve-yesh" states that in a place
            where all homes have flooring, Rosh’s prohibition does not apply.
            R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach adds that a paved area outside a house,
            even if it is not covered by a roof, is considered part of the
            house, and even the Rema would permit sweeping such an area (SSK

            Some are stringent in the case of a plug that is plugged or
unplugged only infrequently, such as a refrigerator plug (            <em>Ĥut S</em><em>hani</em> 36:1). However, it would seem that all
            plugs should be treated in the same way, since plugs in general are
            plugged and unplugged frequently. Furthermore, their primary
            connection is to the electrical appliance, and thus they are not
considered part of the wall. (See SSK 13:33, n. 112;            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 8:17; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:24:20.)
            However, because a plug is <em>muktzeh</em>, it should be grasped

            If the handle had already fallen off multiple times before Shabbat,
            and everyone is accustomed to using the door with only one of the
            two handles attached, one may push that one handle back into its
            normal place, with no awkwardness (<em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> vol. 3
            ch. 23 n. 71). The permissive rationale of attaching it awkwardly
            is cited in <em>Ĥut S</em><em>hani</em> 36:4:7. When it is
            impossible to insert even one handle, one may open the door with
            the help of a screwdriver or the like (SSK 23:37). Water tanks,
            septic tanks, and electrical or telephone junction panels boxes are
            considered part of the building, and thus it is rabbinically
            prohibited to place a permanent cover on such a structure or to
            open such a cover. If the tank’s cover has a handle, one may open
and close it on Shabbat (<em>Shabbat</em> 126b; SA 308:10; MB            <em>ad loc</em>. 42; SSK ch. 23 n. 146).

According to Rabbeinu Tam, Rosh, <em>Smak</em>, and            <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em>, if the <em>meĥitzot </em>(that is,
            legs that are more than a <em>tefaĥ </em>wide)<em> </em>were set up
            before Shabbat, it is not forbidden to place the tabletop on them.
            If the legs were set up on Shabbat, then one may not place the
            tabletop on them even if the space underneath is not being used.
            However, according to Rashba, Ran, and <em>Magid Mishneh</em>, even
            when the legs are narrower than a <em>tefaĥ</em>, if the space
            underneath is needed then one may not place the tabletop on them.
            According to <em>Tosafot</em> (as quoted by Rashba) and Tur, two
            conditions must be met in order for the placement to be prohibited:
            1) the <em>meĥitzot</em> must be put into place on Shabbat; and 2)
            the space underneath must serve a purpose. Since this law is
            rabbinic, SA 315:3 follows this lenient position. Therefore, if the
            legs are less than a <em>tefaĥ</em> wide, even if the space
            underneath it is used, for example, as a place for people to put
            their feet, one may set the table up in the usual way. Some,
            however, beautify Shabbat by changing the order of the setup even
            in this case, as explained in <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            <em>Beitza</em>
22a states that "Beit Shammai maintains that <em>Boneh</em> and            <em>Soter</em> apply to <em>kelim</em>, while Beit Hillel maintains
that <em>Boneh</em> and <em>Soter</em> do not apply to            <em>kelim</em>." The <em>halakha</em> follows Beit Hillel, as Rava
rules in <em>Shabbat</em> 122b. However, we find in            <em>Shabbat</em> 102b that according to Rav, one may not insert the
wooden handle into the metal blade of a scythe as it constitutes            <em>Boneh</em>. <em>Tosafot</em> <em>ad loc.</em><em> </em>(s.v.
"hai") explain that in a case of bona fide assembly,            <em>Boneh </em>and <em>Soter </em>apply to implements as well. The
            statement that <em>Boneh</em> does not apply to implements refers
            to loose attachments, as I wrote in the main text. This is also the
            opinion of <em>Smag</em>, Rosh, and Tur. Ramban, Rashba, and Ritva
            (on <em>Shabbat</em> 102b) maintain that one may not build an
            implement in its entirety because of <em>Boneh</em>, but adding
            onto an implement is prohibited because of <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>
            . Rashi <em>Shabbat</em> 74b and <em>Yere’im</em> maintain that
even creating an implement is prohibited on account of            <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>, not <em>Boneh</em>. The practical
significance of this halakhic disagreement is when it comes to<em>Soter</em>. If the prohibition is on account of            <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>, then undoing one’s actions is not
            prohibited by Torah law, as <em>Soter</em> is defined as undoing an
            act of <em>Boneh</em>. Therefore, if undoing what was done to an
            implement is necessary for Shabbat, according to Ramban and those
            who follow his approach one may do so, while according to Rashi and
            those who follow his approach it would even be permitted to take
            the entire implement apart. However, according to <em>Tosafot</em>
            and Rosh, this would be forbidden even for a Shabbat need. Only
when dealing with a low-quality implement (such as a            <em>mustekei</em> - a barrel made of an inferior material) would it
            be permissible to take it apart for a Shabbat need, as explained
below in section 11. SA 314:1 rules in accordance with            <em>Tosafot</em> and Rosh. However, in 314:7, in the context of
            asking a non-Jew to break a vessel for a Shabbat need, it is
            lenient in accordance with Rashi and those who follow him. The
            justification for this leniency is that two mitigating factors are
            involved: asking a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat (which
            is only a rabbinic prohibition) and a Shabbat need (for example, if
the fruits in the vessel are otherwise inaccessible). See<em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:23:32. Rambam (MT 10:13) follows            <em>Tosafot</em>, maintaining that <em>Boneh</em> applies to
            implements. On the other hand, he permits breaking a barrel to get
to the food inside it, even if the barrel is not considered a<em>mustekei</em> (MT 23:2). See <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 314:5.            <em></em>

Along the same lines as the dispensation quoted in the            <em>mishna</em> above, a <em>beraita</em> cites R. Shimon b.
            Gamliel as stating: "One may bring a barrel of wine and chop off
            the top with a sword" (<em>Shabbat</em> 146a). This is because the
            person does not intend to make a neat opening. He simply wants to
            get to the wine. This is the ruling of SA 314:1 and 314:6. However,
            Rishonim disagree regarding the type of barrel to which the
            dispensation applies. <em>Tosafot</em> and Rosh understand that the
            dispensation refers to a <em>mustekei</em> barrel, which broke and
            was then put back together using tar. In contrast, Ran maintains
            that even a high-quality barrel may be broken in order to reach the
            food inside it. This would also seem to be the opinion of Rambam
            (MT 23:2). SA 314:1 is stringent like <em>Tosafot</em> and Rosh. In
            any event, even according to the more stringent opinion, today’s
            cans would not be considered better than the <em>mustekei </em>
            barrels of the Talmud, which were meant to be used only once. For
            example, the <em>mustekei</em> barrel that was broken open could
            not be reused. In order to store dried figs or wine in the barrel,
            its top would have to be reattached.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>
            51:11 is concerned that a can becomes a receptacle upon being
            opened. If so, opening it is not breaking it but rather creating a
            receptacle (<em>kli</em>), because it can now be used repeatedly.
            However, many maintain that the can was already a <em>kli</em>
prior to being opened, as in fact it preserved the food within it (            <em>Tehila Le-David</em> 314:12). Opening it thus destroys it, as
            it can no longer be used. Even if, 60 years ago, many people used
cans to store nails and the like, today almost no one does this (            <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 1:24). Those who are lenient here include R.
Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (SSK 9:3 and <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 314:5);<em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 4:82; R. Ovadia Yosef (            <em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4, p. 250); and R. Mordechai Eliyahu.
            However, in order to avoid the problem raised by <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>
            that one might be creating a receptacle, some suggest puncturing
            the bottom of a can before opening it. Then, when it is opened, it
            does not become a receptacle because there is a hole in the bottom
            (SSK 9:3). On the other hand, many who follow <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>
feel that one may not even make this first hole (            <em>Minĥat Ish</em> 17:3). Additionally, those who feel one may
            open a can should not make the hole because it is a destructive
            act, which is rabbinically forbidden. Moreover, sometimes
            puncturing the can may cause a violation of <em>Borer</em>. Thus,
            it is preferable to open a can in the normal way. One who wishes to
            comply with the stringent opinion as well should open cans before
            Shabbat, or at least empty them out immediately after opening them.

            The dispensation to tear <em>ĥotalot</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 146a)
            is not limited, so even if the opening allows the dates to be
removed easily, there is no prohibition. Even in the case of a            <em>mustekei</em> barrel (<em>Shabbat</em> 146a; <em>Beitza</em>
            33b), one may make an opening through which the contents can be
            removed over the course of a few days, on condition that there is
            no possibility that it is a neat opening, which would allow the
barrel to be used repeatedly. Therefore, the <em>mishna</em> in            <em>Shabbat</em> allows making an opening in the top of a barrel
            even if it is made to pour out wine. Only if the hole is made in
            the side of the barrel, where it is clear that the opening is meant
            to be used multiple times, is it forbidden (<em>Shabbat</em> 146a).
            Indeed, this is the ruling of SA 314:6. The reasoning behind all
            these permissive rulings is that since we are dealing with
            packaging that is meant to be used only once, the container is
            secondary to the food within it. Thus, it is comparable to the peel
            of a fruit, which may be cut up and removed with no limitations.
            Even when the package is large and it will take days to finish up
            what is inside, as is the case with a milk carton or a bag of
            sugar, there is no prohibition, as the Sages permitted opening a
            wine barrel or <em>ĥotalot</em> even though they were not
            immediately emptied out. (This is also implied in <em>m. Kelim</em>
            16:5, according to the explanation of Rash.) It is only if a neat
            hole is made in the package, in order to allow multiple uses after
            the current contents of the package are finished, that there is a
            prohibition. In contrast, when dealing with containers of milk,
            packages of sugar, and the like, it would never dawn on anyone to
reuse them, so there is no issue of <em>Boneh</em> or            <em>Kore’a</em> when opening them. Those who are stringent maintain
            that the dispensation to make an opening is limited to something
            that is not part of the packaging itself but only adheres to it,
            like the lid of a barrel; but if one makes a neat opening in the
            package itself to pour the milk or measure out the sugar, it is
            like making a receptacle. However, the prohibition is only
            rabbinic, since the opening only serves for the contents’ removal,
not their reinsertion (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 51:10; see<em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 12:6). They are also concerned about            <em>Kore’a</em> when opening a bag of sugar, since many maintain
            that tearing is prohibited if it serves a constructive purpose.
            However, we have already seen that the law pertaining to a package
            of food is the same as that of <em>ĥotalot</em>, where the
            prohibition of <em>Kore’a</em> is completely irrelevant. Some of
            the lenient opinions<em> </em>concede that ideally one should
            comply with the stringent position and open packages before
Shabbat. If it is necessary to open a bag of milk on Shabbat,            <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is better to make a smaller opening than
            one normally would during the week or to tear the plastic with
            one’s teeth, so that it is clear that one does not mean to make a
            neat opening. This way, even some of the stringent opinions would
            concede that it is permissible.

            The law of opening packages of clothing and the like is the same as
that of packages of food (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach,            <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 314:7:6). Just as one may use packages of
            food until their contents have been finished, so too when opening
            packages of tissues or diapers he may use the packages until their
            contents have been finished. Those who are stringent require
destroying the packaging entirely (<em>Minĥat Ish</em> 17:22;            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 12:23). According to <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
            314 n. 22, one should not rip the wrapping paper off a book or
            picture, because those who are lenient only permit tearing a
            package when the item is needed for Shabbat, and that is not the
            case here. It would seem in practice that one may do so if there is
            a need. However, MB 340:41 and BHL s.v. "ha-niyar" prohibit opening
            a letter even if there is a great need. On the other hand, Maharil,
            MA 519:4, and <em>Taz</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 5 permit it. Since the
            prohibition is rabbinic and there is a need, one may be lenient.

            The stringent opinion of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach regarding the
            removal of metal bottle caps is quoted in <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em>
(314:9:4-5). It is also recorded in SSK 9:18 and<em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 12:17. <em>Responsa</em>            <em>Devar Yehoshua</em> 2:45 disagrees with R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach, based on <em>Magid Mishneh</em> 12:2, which explains that
            as long as one does not intend to create an implement, we do not
            consider it a <em>psik reisha</em>. Therefore, one may pour a large
            quantity of cold water into a very hot kettle. Since he does not
            intend to temper the kettle and thus apply one of the final stages
            of the metal forging process, it is not prohibited even though in
            fact he is doing so. MA 318:36, <em>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</em> 314:11, and
            MB 318:80 follow this position. Here too, one’s intention is to
            open the bottle, not to produce a bottle cap. R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach disagrees with this position, maintaining that even though
            one’s primary intention is to open the bottle, he also wishes to
            produce a bottle cap. However, many believe that the bottle cap was
            considered functional even before the bottle is opened, but could
            not be used in practice because it was attached to the bottle by
            the metal rim. This is the approach of<em> Tzitz Eliezer</em>
            14:45:1, <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:42, and <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em>
            2:27:8; R. Mordechai Eliyahu ruled this way as well. If one intends
            to throw away the bottle cap, R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach agrees that
one may open the bottle (as explained by <em>Devar Yehoshua</em>            <em>ad loc.</em>). If one needs the cap, R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach
            allows him to puncture it and then open it, because by doing so he
            renders it less functional as a bottle cap. However, according to
            those who are lenient, since it is not necessary to puncture the
            cap, it is questionable whether one may do so. If it is considered
            an implement even before it is opened, it is rabbinically
prohibited to destroy it. If it is comparable to a            <em>mustekei</em>, it might be permitted to destroy it (even if it
            is not necessary). Those who take into account the opinion of R.
            Auerbach and his followers do so in an attempt to avoid a possible
            Torah prohibition.

        <p>
            According to R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, one may remove the ring
            that remains on a metal or plastic bottle cap, since the cap is
already functional without it. Others forbid this on account of            <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em>. R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv maintains that
this is forbidden because of <em>Meĥatekh</em> (            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 12:19-20). It would seem that even those who
            prohibit this would agree that the prohibition is rabbinic.

            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
            11:43 and 12:5 cite R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv as forbidding opening
            a pop-top can in the normal manner and R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach as
            permitting this. R. Meir Mazuz and <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:24:5
            permit this on condition that one pours the drink into the cup.
This approach is also recorded in <em>Eshmera Shabbat</em> 1:1:17.            <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:27:6 permits this on condition that the pop
            top is not opened entirely, so that the can will not be easily
            usable. Accordingly, even those who are stringent would concede
that a complete <em>melakha</em> was not performed.            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 314:23 states in the name of R. Ovadia Yosef
            that technically one may open a pop top, but it is proper to be
            stringent and not open it entirely.

            Included among the permissive <em>poskim</em> are: R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach (<em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 314:13:3); <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em>
2:27, n. 7; <em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4, p. 254; and<em>Binyan Shabbat</em> 11:3. Included among the stringent<em>poskim</em> are: R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (quoted in            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 12 n. 22); <em>Ĥut</em><em> Shani</em>
vol. 1, pp. 128-129; R. Mordechai Eliyahu; and            <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:16:14. Even though some state that this is
            a Torah prohibition, it seems that Rambam (MT Laws of Yom Tov 4:8)
            maintains that if there is a prohibition at all, it is only
            rabbinic. Therefore, I wrote in the main text that one who wishes
            to be lenient has an opinion to rely upon.

            There is a debate about tearing open small sugar packets that are
            often perforated to facilitate tearing them. According to R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach, one may tear along the dotted lines, because no
            one cares exactly where the cut is; the point of the perforation is
            to make it easier to tear open. R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, however,
            maintains that the prohibition of <em>Meĥatekh</em> applies because
            one is cutting precisely. Therefore, the packet must be torn at a
            different place (<em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 11:41).
