        1. The Mitzva to Preserve Shabbat as a Day of Rest
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Torah commands us to refrain from <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat: "But
the seventh day is Shabbat of the Lord your God; you shall not do any<em>melakha</em>" (Shemot 20:9), that is, any of the 39 types of        <em>melakha</em> done while erecting the <em>Mishkan</em>, as explained
        to Moshe at Sinai (see above, 9:1-2). The Sages added safeguards
        ("fences") so that no one would do anything that might then lead to the
        violation of a Torah prohibition (see above, 9:3-4). There is an
        additional commandment in the Torah to rest on Shabbat: "Six days you
        shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease" (Shemot
        23:12). The point here is that in addition to avoiding <em>melakha</em>
        on Shabbat, we are also meant to cease and rest from toils and
        troubles. Thus one should not open his store or move heavy objects in
        preparation for the workweek. Even though these are not included in the
        39 prohibited categories of <em>melakha</em>, nevertheless acting in
        these ways negates the mitzva of resting on Shabbat (Ramban, Vayikra
        23:24; see MT 21:1 and the next section below).
    </p>
    <p>
        Continuing with this line of thought, we find the prophets enjoining us
        to preserve the holy and sanctified atmosphere of Shabbat, a day on
        which one must avoid mundane activities. One who is careful to follow
        this merits great rewards, as Yeshayahu proclaims:
    </p>
    <p>
        If you refrain from trampling the Shabbat, from pursuing your affairs
        on My holy day; if you call Shabbat "delight," the Lord’s holy [day]
        "honored," and if you honor it, and not go in your own way, nor look to
        your affairs, nor speak of them - then you will seek the Lord’s
        delight. I will set you astride the heights of the earth, and let you
        enjoy the heritage of your father Yaakov - for the mouth of the Lord
        has spoken. (Yeshayahu 58:13-14)
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages derive many guidelines about Shabbat from this verse, and the
        common denominator is that one should not behave on Shabbat as one does
        during the week. The Gemara elaborates:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Honor it" - your Shabbat clothes should not be like your weekday
        clothes…. "Not go in your own way" - the way you walk on Shabbat should
        not be like the way you walk on weekdays. "Nor look to your affairs" -
        it is forbidden to look after your own affairs on Shabbat, but one may
        look after the affairs of heaven [i.e., religious matters]. "Nor speak
        of them" - your speech on Shabbat should not be like your speech on
        weekdays. Speaking [about mundane matters] is forbidden, but thinking
        about them is permitted. (<em>Shabbat</em> 113a).
    </p>
    <p>
        These directives have a higher status than general rabbinic enactments
        since they are rooted in the Torah’s commandment to rest and are
        elaborated upon by the prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have already explained the <em>mitzvot</em> connected to honoring
and delighting in Shabbat (chs. 2, 4, 5, 7). Honor (<em>kavod</em>)        <em> </em>is expressed by wearing special Shabbat clothes, showering,
cleaning the house, and lighting candles. Delight (<em>oneg</em>)        <em> </em>is expressed by making Shabbat enjoyable through meals,
sleep, and Torah study. In this chapter, we will explain the        <em>mitzvot</em> and the rabbinic safeguards meant to protect Shabbat’s
        atmosphere as a holy day of rest. These <em>mitzvot</em> are at the
        root of everything that the Sages through the ages forbade as a weekday
        activity. Any activity that is unquestionably mundane is prohibited on
        Shabbat. This includes ball-playing for adults, swimming, working out,
        and bike-riding. To protect the spirit of Shabbat, the Sages also
        introduced the prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em> (as explained in the
        next chapter) and ordained that one may not play musical instruments
        (sections 17-19 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though the <em>mitzvot</em> to preserve Shabbat’s spirit and avoid
        weekday activity (<em>uvdin de-ĥol</em>)<em> </em>are of a higher
status than the safeguards of the Sages, nevertheless the        <em>halakha</em> is stricter in demanding adherence to the safeguards,
        such as the prohibition to do <em>melakha</em> with a <em>shinui</em>
        or to ask a non-Jew to do a <em>melakha</em>, which are forbidden even
        for the sake of a mitzva (as explained above 9:3-4, 11), whereas the
        prohibitions connected to preserving the spirit of Shabbat may be
        disregarded in the service of a mitzva (as explained below). There are
        some prohibitions that are comprised of both of these elements: if
        prohibited solely to preserve the spirit of Shabbat, it might have been
        permitted for the sake of a mitzva, but since the Sages decreed that it
        is prohibited, it remains prohibited even for the sake of a mitzva.
    </p>

        2. Business
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not engage in commerce on Shabbat. One who opens his store,
        buying and selling on Shabbat just as he does on weekdays, negates a
        Torah commandment. This prohibition applies even if he is careful to
        avoid transgressing any of the 39 <em>melakhot</em>. The Torah commands
        that Shabbat be a "<em>shabbaton</em>" (Shemot 31:15), a complete
        cessation. One who does business in his store is not<em> </em>resting
        (Ramban, Vayikra 23:24; Ritva; <em>Ĥatam Sofer</em>). Neĥemia faced
        this problem when he arrived in Jerusalem and found that people were
        holding a market day on Shabbat. He recounts:
    </p>
    <p>
        Tyrians (merchants) who lived there brought fish and all sorts of wares
        and sold them on Shabbat to the Judahites in Jerusalem. I censured the
        nobles of Judah, saying to them, "What evil thing is this that you are
        doing, profaning Shabbat day! This is just what your ancestors did, and
        for it God brought all this misfortune on this city; and now you give
        cause for further wrath against Israel by profaning Shabbat!" (Neĥemia
        13:15-18)
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, the merchants began selling their goods outside the city
        walls on Shabbat. In response, Neĥemia ordered that the gates of the
        city be closed over Shabbat. "Once or twice the merchants and the
        vendors of all sorts of wares spent the night outside Jerusalem, but I
        warned them, saying, ‘What do you mean by spending the night alongside
        the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands upon you!’ From then on,
        they did not come on Shabbat" (<em>ibid.</em> 19-21).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition on commerce applies to one who regularly does
        business on Shabbat. However, one who buys or sells on Shabbat
        occasionally still transgresses the words of the prophets, as Yeshayahu
        said: "if you honor it, and not go in your own way, nor look to your
        affairs, nor speak of them" (58:13), and the Sages explained this to
mean that one should not deal in mundane matters on Shabbat (        <em>Shabbat </em>113a).
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be noted that those verses do not record a prohibition on
        buying and selling for the sake of a mitzva. Nevertheless, as a
        safeguard, the Sages prohibited all business dealings, even in service
of a mitzva, out of concern lest one write (Rashi and <em>Tosafot</em>,        <em>Beitza</em> 37a; MB 306:11). The only exception to this prohibition
        is the mitzva of settling the land of Israel, for which one may
        purchase land from a non-Jew on Shabbat. The non-Jew should write the
contract and take the money on his own (SA 306:11; <em>Eliya Rabba</em><em>ad loc.</em> 22; <em>Mor U-ketzi’a</em>; as opposed to MA        <em> ad loc.</em> 19; see above 9:12).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are stringent and do not sell <em>aliyot</em> on Shabbat, because
        of the prohibition of doing business on Shabbat. However, many are
        customarily lenient, and they have grounds for their leniency. This is
        because, in this case, there is no acquisition (<em>kinyan</em>) or
payment on Shabbat, and the assumption of the obligation to pay for the<em>aliyot</em> is deemed to be for the sake of a mitzva (MB 306:33;        <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:41). However, if the synagogue’s income from
        this practice is minimal, it is improper to be lenient and waste the
        congregation’s time.
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Obtaining Products from Stores
    </h2>
    <p>
        One who finds himself short of food on Shabbat for the Shabbat meals,
        whether on account of poor planning or the arrival of unexpected
        guests, may approach the owner of a store and ask him for food from his
        store, with the unspoken understanding that the customer will pay for
        the food after Shabbat. Payment is not mentioned explicitly. Rather,
        the customer should request the item from the owner in the same way
        that he would borrow the food from a neighbor. He should not use the
        words "buy," "sell," or "pay." He may assure the store owner that
        later, whether Saturday night or afterward, they will discuss what was
        taken and settle up. Even though the store owner understands from this
        assurance that the customer intends to pay him, as long as payment has
        not been explicitly mentioned (but only hinted at), this is not
        forbidden.
    </p>
    <p>
        The store owner and customer should both be careful not to mention the
        price of a product, nor should they measure it or weigh it out as one
        would do during the week to determine its price. However, they may fill
        up a container (not a measuring cup) and agree that the container will
        be measured on Sunday, with the understanding that the price will be
        determined based on the amount it holds. One may use a measuring cup to
        transport food but not to measure out the exact amount to be poured
        into the customer’s container, because then it is clear that the
        intention is to measure. For example, one may ask a store owner for
        five oranges or five bottles because that is the normal way to describe
        the required quantity. This terminology is not used exclusively for a
        sale. If this customer has received items from the store owner in the
        past, the owner may not refer to the accumulating tab nor calculate its
        updated amount (SA 323:1-4; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 20; SSK 29:18-25).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the store owner does not trust the customer to remember to pay him
        after Shabbat, he may ask him to leave an article of clothing or an
        object, but he should not refer to it as "collateral," "security
        deposit," or the like (Rema 307:11).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who takes food from a store on Shabbat should not carry it out in a
        large box, as one would normally do during the week, so that witnesses
        do not think that he is transporting the food for commercial purposes.
        Rather, he should hold the items in his hands or place them on his
        shoulders, as one would normally do when bringing food to a meal. Even
        if this means he will have to make multiple trips in order to bring all
        the necessary food, this extra walking is preferable to giving the
        appearance of doing business. However, if one’s guests are waiting for
        the meal, then he should hurry and bring all the food at once, even if
        it means carrying the food as he would during the week. Additionally,
        if he is walking in a place where there is no chance that anyone will
        suspect him of doing business, he may carry the food in the normal way
in order to minimize the walking ("<em>yesh omrim</em>" in SA 323:5; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 25; Rema 510:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a store or hotel owner would like to make food available on Shabbat
        for his customers, before Shabbat he may sell different-colored cards
        or tickets that entitle their bearers to various items. For example, a
        yellow card presented to a waiter will entitle a guest to Friday night
        dinner; a green card to lunch on Shabbat day; a red card to a drink; a
        blue card to cake, etc. If there are not enough different colors for
        the different options, the names of the options may be written on the
        cards. However, the prices may not be written on the cards because this
        would make the cards the equivalent of monetary contracts, which may
        not be read on Shabbat (MB 307:50 and 323:20; SSK 29:26).
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Lending, Borrowing, and Giving Gifts
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as one may not buy and sell on Shabbat, one may not lend anything
        or repay a loan. Since these activities often involve writing
        contracts, there is a concern that engaging in them may lead one to
        write. Therefore, one who needs to borrow food, clothing, or chairs for
        Shabbat should formulate his request in a way that makes it clear that
        he is borrowing the objects as one would borrow from a friend, not as
        one would borrow money from a bank, as it is unusual keep a written
        record when borrowing from a friend. Since English does not distinguish
between these two types of borrowing (unlike Hebrew, which has "        <em>hashala</em>" to refer to borrowing objects and "<em>halva’ah</em>"
        to refer to monetary lending), one should simply say "Give me" or "Can
        I have." If the owner of the item is concerned that the borrower will
        forget to return it, he may request that the borrower leave something
        with him, but he should not refer to it as a deposit or collateral, as
        he would during the week (<em>Shabbat</em> 148a; Rema 307:11). If the
        borrower mistakenly asked for a loan, the owner may give it to him
        while clarifying that he may use it temporarily though one may not make
        a loan on Shabbat (<em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 307:15:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        According to many <em>poskim</em>, one may not give or receive presents
        on Shabbat because by doing so one transfers ownership of the gift,
which resembles commerce (MA 306:15; <em>Birkei Yosef</em>        <em>ad loc.</em> 7; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 33). Others maintain that one
may give a gift on Shabbat because nobody writes contracts for gifts (        <em>Beit Meir</em> based on Rif and Rambam). In practice, we are
        stringent <em>le-khatĥila</em> and avoid giving gifts on Shabbat, but
        if it is necessary to fulfill a mitzva, everyone agrees that one may
        give a gift (SA 658:3-4). Therefore, one may give a gift of utensils or
        food for a Shabbat meal (MB 306:33). One may also give prizes to
        children for participating in Torah study, as this is for the sake of a
        mitzva - to encourage the children to study Torah.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is proper for one who wants to give a bar mitzva present on Shabbat
        to perform the act of acquisition (<em>kinyan</em>) before Shabbat.
        That is, he should request someone else to take the gift, lifting it up
        (<em>hagbaha</em>) in order to acquire it on behalf of the bar mitzva
        boy. Thus, the gift is transferred to the boy’s ownership before
        Shabbat. On Shabbat it may be presented to him, as it already belonged
        to him prior to Shabbat. If <em>hagbaha</em> was not done, the gift can
        be left with the boy (who should have in mind not to acquire it) for
        the duration of Shabbat, and after Shabbat he may officially acquire it
        (SSK 29:31). Some are lenient and give gifts to a groom on Shabbat, as
there is an element of mitzva involved in bringing him happiness (        <em>Eliya Rabba</em>; <em>Ĥatam Sofer</em>). In a time of need, one may
        rely upon them (<em>Seridei Esh</em> 2:26).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not use a lottery or other random selection mechanism on
        Shabbat in order to decide who will receive each portion of food. Since
        everyone wants the biggest and tastiest portion, there is a concern
        that people will end up measuring and weighing the portions or speaking
        about their price. Moreover, it contains an element of gambling.
        Members of a household may use a lottery, but only as long as the
        portions are of equal value (<em>Shabbat</em> 148b-149a; SA 322:6; see
        below 22:8). One may draw lots to determine who will have the privilege
        of getting an <em>aliya</em> or saying <em>Kaddish</em>, because there
        is nothing to measure or calculate (MB 322:24).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Court Activity, Weddings, <em>Teruma</em> and <em>Ma’aser</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade rabbinical courts to sit in judgment or mete out
        punishment on Shabbat. Similarly, they prohibited betrothals,
marriages, divorce, <em>yibum</em> (levirate marriage), or        <em>ĥalitza</em> (levirate divorce) out of concern that people would
        end up writing (<em>Beitza</em> 37a). It is similarly prohibited to
redeem a firstborn son on Shabbat, because the redemption (        <em>pidyon ha-ben</em>) involves a transfer of money, which resembles
        commerce. If the 31st day after birth coincides with Shabbat, the
        redemption is done the following day, Sunday. It is also forbidden to
        vow, consecrate, or dedicate items or their value to the Temple on
        Shabbat, as this transfers ownership of the objects to God, as it were,
        and resembles commerce. However, one may pledge to give charity,
        because such a commitment involves no act of acquisition. If one did
        buy, sell, or perform any of these actions on Shabbat, the transaction
        is effective (<em>m. Beitza</em> 36b; SA 339:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Teruma</em>
        , <em>ma’aser</em> and <em>ĥalla</em> may not be set aside on Shabbat,
        because setting them aside resembles dedicating them to God.
Additionally, it looks like one is fixing or improving the produce (        <em>Beitza</em> 36b; MT 23:14). If one made a mistake and unknowingly
        set them aside, the remaining produce may be eaten on Shabbat. In
        contrast, if he did this knowingly, although the action is effective
        and the remaining produce may be eaten, no Jew may eat it until after
        Shabbat (<em>m. Terumot</em> 2:3; MB 339:25).
    </p>
    <p>
One who is concerned that he will not have time to separate        <em>teruma</em> and <em>ma’aser</em> before Shabbat may recite the
formula for the separation before Shabbat (but without the        <em>berakha</em>). By doing so, he has begun the process of separation.
        Then, after Shabbat begins, he may tithe in the normal fashion and
        recite the <em>berakha</em>. This procedure may also be followed if one
        is concerned that he will not have time to set aside <em>ĥalla</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
Only the owner of the produce may separate <em>teruma </em>and        <em>ma’aser</em><em> </em>on Shabbat by means of the procedure
        described in the previous paragraph; it is not effective for anyone
        else. If a guest is concerned that his host may forget to tithe, he may
        ask the host before Shabbat to appoint him a <em>shali’aĥ</em> (proxy)
        to tithe on his behalf. The guest may then recite the formulation
before Shabbat and perform the actual tithing on Shabbat (        <em>m. Demai</em> 7:1, 5; MT, Laws of Tithes 9:7-9).

        6. Immersing and Measuring on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        As is well known, a Jew who bought or received an eating utensil or
        receptacle from a non-Jew may not use it for food until it has been
        immersed in a <em>mikveh</em>. If one did not immerse it before
        Shabbat, some maintain that doing so on Shabbat is forbidden because it
        looks like one is fixing the implement (<em>tikun kli</em>). After all,
        before its immersion, one may not use it, while afterward, one may
        (Rosh). Others maintain that if one needs to eat from it, he may
        immerse it on Shabbat with a <em>berakha</em>. Accordingly, immersion
is not considered fixing, because if <em>be-di’avad</em> the        <em>kli </em>was used for food without having been immersed, the food
        retains its kosher status (Rif). If there is a trustworthy non-Jew in
        the vicinity, it is proper to give the <em>kli </em>to him as a gift,
        and then request his permission to use it. In this way, a Jew may use
        the <em>kli </em>for food even though it has not been immersed (SA
        323:7). After Shabbat, it is proper to ask the non-Jew to give it back
        to him as a gift; he should then immerse it with a <em>berakha</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
All agree that one may immerse on Shabbat to purify himself from        <em>tum’a</em>. Even those who maintain that <em>kelim</em><em> </em>
        may not be immersed because it resembles fixing them agree that when it
        comes to people, since one may bathe, and since the immersion will not
        necessarily be seen as an act of purification, one may also immerse to
        purify himself (see above 14:9). In contrast, one converting to Judaism
        may not immerse on Shabbat as part of the conversion process because
        his immersion is transformative; he becomes a new person, a process
        that certainly qualifies as a <em>tikun</em>. Additionally, immersion
        for conversion requires the presence of a rabbinic court; just as a
        court does not meet on Shabbat for judgment, it also does not meet to
        supervise immersion (<em>Yevamot</em> 46b). If a court transgressed and
        did supervise an immersion on Shabbat, the immersion is valid, and the
        person is Jewish (SA YD 268:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not measure anything on Shabbat, because measuring is a weekday
        activity (SA 306:7; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 34). Therefore, one may not
        weigh himself or measure his height on Shabbat (SSK 14:42). Similarly,
        one may not measure the dimensions of furniture or a room.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may measure and weigh for the sake of a mitzva. Therefore, one may
check whether a <em>mikveh</em> has sufficient water (forty        <em>se’ah</em>). One may also measure out medicine for sick people and
        take their temperature (SA 306:7; SSK 40:2). Since a baby has the same
        halakhic status as a sick person, when necessary one may measure out
        the amount of food that a baby needs. Similarly, when necessary one may
        measure if a baby has gained weight after eating (using a non-electric
        scale; SSK 37:5).

        7. Walking, Running, and Jumping
    </h2>
    <p>
        The world we live in is full of shortcomings. To perfect it, we rush
        around all week long, working and exerting ourselves in a variety of
        ways. However, on Shabbat, which is like the World to Come, we are
        commanded to cease all work and act as if everything has already been
        perfected, with no further need to rush around. We are meant simply to
        delight in the holiness of Shabbat and take a faith-filled look at the
        perfect inner essence of the world as God created it. There is a mitzva
        to express this spiritual perspective by walking at a leisurely pace on
        Shabbat. Thus the Sages expound: "‘Not go in your own way’ - the way
you walk on Shabbat should not be like the way you walk on weekdays" (        <em>Shabbat</em> 113a).
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, running is prohibited on Shabbat, as is striding. This
        prohibition applies to one who is going somewhere for his own sake, in
        which case he should walk at a leisurely pace to honor Shabbat.
        However, if one is going to attend a Torah class or to pray, it is a
        mitzva for him to run (<em>Berakhot</em> 6b; SA 301:1), because running
        for the sake of a mitzva does not detract from the honor due Shabbat.
        On the contrary, it expresses the spirit of Shabbat, which allows us to
        rest from the troubles of this world. This peacefulness in turn
        encourages us to serve God.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may run and jump if one benefits greatly from it. For example, one
        may run in order to get out of the rain, and one may jump over a puddle
        to avoid dirtying his shoes. One may also run in order to watch
        something enjoyable (<em>Shabbat</em> 113b; SA 301:2-3). Children and
        teens who enjoy running may participate in games that involve running,
        since this type of running is pleasurable rather than burdensome (SA
        301:2). Also, adults may jump for pleasure as part of playing with
        small children.
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. Working Out and Riding a Bicycle
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not run for exercise on Shabbat, because it is burdensome
        rather than pleasurable. Even though people who work out enjoy it, this
        enjoyment derives from their awareness that they are taking care of
        their health and physical fitness, not from the exercise itself. Even
        one who is very fit, runs every day, and enjoys it may not run on
        Shabbat, because it is a weekday activity. It will appear to others
        that he is belittling Shabbat and treating it like a weekday. However,
        one who enjoys exercise may jump or work out for pleasure inside his
        home on condition that he does not overexert himself, does not follow a
        regimen, and does not use special equipment, any of which would be
        deemed a weekday activity. One may not play ball for the same reason;
        even children may not play with a ball that adults use for sports,
        because it is a weekday activity.
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may walk on Shabbat for one’s health, on condition that he walks
        regularly and not more briskly or more intensively than usual. Although
        one may not address medical needs on Shabbat, since it is not
        discernible that his walking has a medical purpose, and many people
        take walks, he may walk for health and fitness on Shabbat (MB 301:7).
        One may also do gentle stretches in order to loosen up.
    </p>
    <p>
        The later <em>poskim</em> agree that one may not ride a bicycle on
        Shabbat. Some maintain that the reason for this prohibition is a
        concern that one will travel outside the <em>teĥum</em>, while others
        say that the concern is that the bicycle will break and he will end up
        fixing it. In fact, the main reason is that it is a weekday activity,
        since people ride bicycles primarily to travel to work or to exercise.

        9. Walking for Non-Shabbat Purposes
    </h2>
    <p>
        Even when one takes a relaxed walk, he may not walk to his fields or
        factory in order to plan out his workweek. Doing so is included in the
        category of "your affairs," which may not be addressed on Shabbat, as
        it is stated: "if you honor it, and not go in your own way, nor look to
        your affairs" (Yeshayahu 58:13). However, if it is not obvious that his
        intention is to plan his work, there is no prohibition. Therefore, one
        may take a Shabbat walk as long as onlookers cannot tell that he is
        looking over his fields. It is pious to avoid thinking about business
        on Shabbat altogether (see SA 306:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one who is building a house should not check the progress on
        Shabbat, because it is obvious that he is planning his work, and one
        who intends to renovate or expand his home may not examine other
        projects if it is clear that he is planning the renovations. So too,
        one considering buying an apartment may not check out apartments for
        sale on Shabbat. In contrast, one considering buying an apartment may
        walk to a street where new apartments are being built even though his
        intention is to look them over, as long as it looks like he is just out
        for a walk and he does not stop and scrutinize them; this way, he does
        not look like he is planning his purchase. If one is planning to buy an
        electrical appliance, he may window-shop at appliance stores while
        walking on the street. However, he should not look at prices (SSK
        29:10). In addition, it is pious to avoid thinking about these matters
        at all on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
Toward the end of Shabbat, one may not walk to the edge of the        <em>teĥum</em> in order to hire workers as soon after Shabbat as
        possible. Similarly, one may not go to his field, store, or factory at
        that time so that he can begin work immediately after Shabbat. Since it
        is clear that he is going there on Shabbat in order to work afterward,
        in effect he is dealing with his weekday affairs on Shabbat. However,
        if it is not clear that this is the reason he is going there, as is the
        case, for example, if many people take walks there, then he may walk
        there on Shabbat even if he intends to hire workers or begin his work
        immediately afterward. This is because the prohibition only applies
when it is clear that he is going for a mundane purpose (SA 306:1; MB<em>ad loc.</em> 1; BHL s.v. "she-me’ayen; SA 307:9; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 40).

    <a name="10"></a><h2>
        10. Talking about Work and Business
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a mitzva to honor Shabbat in the way one speaks, as it is
        written: "and if you honor it, and not go in your own way, nor look to
        your affairs, nor speak of them" (Yeshayahu 58:13). The Sages
        elaborate: "‘Nor speak of them’ - your speech on Shabbat should not be
        like your speech on weekdays" (<em>Shabbat</em> 113a). This means that
        one should not speak on Shabbat about things that one may not do on
        Shabbat. Therefore, one should not say, "Tomorrow I will travel by
        car," "I will write a letter," or "I will buy an item." Clearly, then,
        it is also prohibited for one to ask someone else to travel the next
        day on his behalf, write a letter for him, or buy something for him (SA
        307:1). This prohibition applies to things that one intends to do in
        the future. However, one may speak about what he has already done, as
        long as he does not intend to provide useful information to the
        listener on how best to perform the <em>melakha</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition applies to talking about actions prohibited on Shabbat.
        In contrast, one may think about them. Thus the Sages expound:
        "Speaking [about mundane matters] is forbidden, but thinking about them
is permitted" (<em>Shabbat</em> 113a). Speech that merely alludes to a        <em>melakha</em> is considered "thinking" and is thus permitted. For
        example, while one may not say, "Tomorrow I will phone so-and-so," one
        may say, "Tomorrow I will speak with so-and-so," even though it is
        clear that he will do so by phone. Similarly, one may not say,
        "Tomorrow I will drive to Jerusalem," since traveling by motor vehicle
        is prohibited on Shabbat, but one may say, "Tomorrow I will go to
        Jerusalem," since one can "go" by walking, and even though Jerusalem is
outside the <em>teĥum</em>, theoretically one could build an        <em>eruv</em> to Jerusalem and it would be permitted to walk there on
        Shabbat. Since walking to Jerusalem is not fundamentally prohibited,
        one may talk about "going" there. Even if the listener realizes that
        the speaker means that he is planning to travel by car or bus and that
        the listener may join him if he wishes, the statement is still
        considered only a hint and is permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if one plans to travel by cab after Shabbat, on Shabbat he
        may ask his friend who is a cabdriver, "Do you think you will be able
        to come over after Shabbat?" Since he has not asked his friend to come
        with his cab in order to drive him, then even though his friend
        understands that this is what is meant, it is not prohibited. However,
        he may not say to his cabdriver friend, "Come over after Shabbat,
        please," because an allusion in the imperative form is prohibited.
        Following the same principle, one who wishes to hire a worker on Sunday
        may say to him on Shabbat, "I hope to see you on Sunday," but he may
        not say, "Please come on Sunday" (<em>Shabbat</em> 150a; SA 307:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not speak about monetary transactions that have business
        implications, while one may talk about them if they have no practical
        import. Therefore, one may not speak about wages owed to workers, but
        one may speak about wages already paid. Similarly, one may not tell
        another how much a house sold for if the listener is interested in
        buying a similar house, while one may pass on this information to
        someone who is not interested in buying a home. Likewise, one may
        report on how much yield a field produced the previous year, what the
        government’s budget is, and the like. This is because the people
        involved in these conversations have no plans to act on these
        discussions during the week (SA 307:6).
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is preferable to minimize trivial conversations on Shabbat. One who
        enjoys such conversations may engage in them a bit more than usual, as
        they are part of his physical enjoyment of Shabbat. However, he should
        not indulge himself excessively, just as he should not eat or sleep
        excessively, as these indulgences will take away from the time he needs
        to set aside for Torah study on Shabbat. We have already seen that a
        minimum of six hours must be dedicated to Torah study on Shabbat (SA
        and Rema 307:1; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 4; see above 5:1).
    </p>
    <a name="11"></a><h2>
        11. Walking and Talking for the Sake of a Mitzva
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may speak about activities that are prohibited on Shabbat if it is
        for the sake of a mitzva. In such a case, one may also examine sites
        where <em>melakha </em>must be done or make financial calculations for
        the sake of a mitzva. It is written: "and if you honor it, and not go
        in your own way, nor look to your affairs, nor speak of them"
        (Yeshayahu 58:13), and the Sages expound: "‘Nor look to your affairs’ -
        it is forbidden to look after your own affairs on Shabbat, but one may
        look after the affairs of heaven (‘<em>ĥeftzei shamayim</em>,’ i.e.,
        religious matters)" (<em>Shabbat</em> 113a). Therefore, if necessary,
        one may walk to inspect a synagogue construction site. If something is
        needed for an upcoming wedding or funeral, one may walk to the edge of
        the <em>teĥum</em> so that one can deal with these matters immediately
        after Shabbat. Near the end of Shabbat, one may also start walking to a
        location from which people will be picked up after Shabbat in order to
        comfort mourners (<em>Shabbat</em> 151a; SA 306:3; SSK 29:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, in cases of necessity, one may speak about mundane matters
        that relate to mitzva needs. This includes calculating the costs of a
wedding meal or a <em>brit mila</em>, as each of these is a        <em>se’udat mitzva</em> (a festive meal associated with a mitzva). One
        may plan the hiring of a band for a wedding or deal with the bride’s
        dress. However, one may not actually close a deal, because business
        deals are prohibited even for the sake of a mitzva. It is altogether
        prohibited to discuss hiring a photographer for a wedding, or the
        purchase of wedding outfits for family members of the bride and groom,
        since these do not qualify as mitzva needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may take up a collection in which everybody pledges to give a
        certain amount of money to charity or to a synagogue. Parents may
        calculate the sum needed for their children’s education, whether
        religious, secular, or vocational. Those involved in education may
        discuss school or class budgets. A principal may offer a job to a
        teacher and mention a salary figure, though it is forbidden to reach an
        agreement on wages. One may discuss communal needs such as paving roads
        or levying taxes, as the needs of the community are deemed mitzva needs
        (<em>Shabbat</em> 150a; SA 306:6). In all these cases, it is proper to
        be lenient only when there is a specific need. If the matter will be
        addressed in any case, it is proper not to speak of mundane matters or
        walk in order to inspect them, even for the sake of a mitzva (MB
        307:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        If necessary, one may announce that an object has been found on
        Shabbat, even if the item in question is <em>muktzeh</em> (such as a
        purse), in order to facilitate the fulfillment (after Shabbat) of the
        mitzva of returning a lost item (SA 306:12). In an area where it is
difficult to locate matza for Pesaĥ or a <em>lulav</em> and        <em>etrog</em> for Sukkot, one may announce on Shabbat where they are
        available for sale (MB 306:55).
    </p>
    <a name="12"></a><h2>
        12. Permitted and Forbidden Reading Material
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not read contracts and financial documents on Shabbat, such as
        loan and purchase contracts, bank statements, phone and electric bills,
        and prices on flyers or in shop windows. Reading them is considered
        dealing with mundane affairs (<em>ĥeftzei ĥol</em>), which is forbidden
        on Shabbat (Rosh). Furthermore, there is a concern that as a result of
        reading them one will end up writing or erasing (Rambam).
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Rambam, one may read only sacred words on Shabbat; all
        other reading material is forbidden, even to study the sciences, so
        that Shabbat is not treated as a weekday and situations that might lead
to writing are avoided. However, in practice, we follow the majority of        <em>poskim</em> (Rashi, Ri, Rosh), who limit the prohibition to reading
        financial and business material. In order to ensure that no one will
        end up reading these materials, the Sages also prohibited reading
        secular material that has no value. In contrast, secular material that
        has value may be read on Shabbat. This includes material on physical
        fitness, proper nutrition, and ingredient lists on food packaging. One
        may also study the sciences and other branches of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not read run-of-the-mill secular material and stories if they
        have no value. However, one who enjoys reading them may do so
        occasionally, as the Sages did not forbid reading for pleasure on
        Shabbat. In contrast, one should not read gripping novels that cause
        sadness or anxiety on Shabbat (MB 306:38 and 307:3). It would seem that
        one may read depressing stories from Jewish history and rabbinic
        biographies, since they are valuable as Torah and are morally edifying.
        Nevertheless, it is preferable to study pleasant things, which are more
        appropriate for Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        In principle, one may read the newspaper for informative content. One
        who enjoys reading news, stories, and analysis may do so, but one may
        not read sad and worrying content on Shabbat. One may read general
        financial articles as long as they do not give practical advice, but
        one may not read articles that give practical business and investment
        advice. It is also forbidden to read advertisements for products that
        one may wish to buy in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though technically one may read parts of the newspaper, many
        maintain that it is proper to avoid reading it on Shabbat because it is
        full of advertisements and disturbing news, and it is difficult to
        distinguish between what one may and may not read. Additionally,
        reading a newspaper negates the main purpose of Shabbat, which is Torah
        study. Therefore, one may read its informative content and
        non-disturbing news, but only while in the bathroom.
        <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may read (and place) ads in leaflets distributed in synagogues, as
        long as they are advertising products that fulfill mitzva needs, such
        as Torah books or homes in Israel (to potential customers from abroad).
        If these products are being sold cheaply and advertising might
        encourage readers to fulfill the mitzva, one may even publish the price
        (see MB 306:55, 307:1, and 323:20).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not read a guest list or menu of a Shabbat meal as it resembles
        reading a contract. In addition, there is a concern that the host may
        wish to correct the list by writing or erasing (<em>Shabbat</em> 149:1;
        SA 307:12-13). In contrast, for the sake of a mitzva, such as the meal
        accompanying a <em>brit mila</em>, or in order to avoid greatly
        insulting someone, a waiter may read the list, as there is no concern
        that he will change it. However, the host or head waiter may not read
the list, because they might end up correcting it (MB 307:47; SHT        <em>ad loc.</em> 54).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>gabbai</em> may read the notebook or cards that contain the
        list of people to be called up to the Torah, since this is for the sake
        of a mitzva. We are not worried that he will end up writing or erasing,
        since he is standing in the middle of a group of people. If he forgets
and wants to write, others will remind him that it is Shabbat. The        <em>gabbai</em> may also call people to the Torah from a list he has
        been given by a family that is celebrating a special occasion in the
        synagogue. If they wish to change the list, the <em>gabbai</em> should
        not review it without at least one other person reviewing it with him
        who can remind him that it is Shabbat, lest he forget.

        13. Games on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Poskim</em>
        disagree whether one may play games on Shabbat. Some say that since
        Shabbat is meant for Torah study, one may not play games, as that would
        be wasting time that could be used to study Torah. Accordingly, one may
        not play checkers, chess, backgammon, billiards, or any ball game,
        whether the games are played inside on the floor or outside on a paved
area. And since one may not play these games, they are considered<em>muktzeh</em> as well (R. Aharon Sasson, cited in        <em>Birkei Yosef </em>338:1; <em>Petaĥ Ha-devir</em> <em>ad loc.</em>
        4).
    </p>
    <p>
        Others maintain that there is no prohibition on playing games on
Shabbat, as long as nobody is playing for money (Rema 338:5;        <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em>). Indeed, some rabbis would play chess on
Shabbat, as it is a game that requires thought and sharpens the mind (        <em>Shiltei Giborim</em>).
        <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, it is appropriate for adults to be stringent and not play
        ball games, chess, and the like, both because it is prohibited
        according to some <em>poskim</em> and because one should not to get
        used to neglecting Torah study on Shabbat. Those who wish to be lenient
have an opinion on which to rely (see SA 308:45; MA 338:5; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 21; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> <em>ad loc.</em> 39).
        Children should also be trained to study Torah on Shabbat, but almost
        all <em>poskim</em> agree that one should not prevent them from playing
        games on Shabbat (as explained below in 24:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, sports that are a big deal, like soccer, basketball,
        baseball, and football, may not be played on Shabbat, because of the
        prohibition on weekday activities. It goes without saying that one may
        not play them on the court or field designated for them. Children may
        not play these sports either, because it is a weekday activity (below
        24:9).

        The Sages prohibited accepting payment for work done on Shabbat,
        because this is included in the prohibition on commerce. Even if the
        "work" is intrinsically permissible on Shabbat (such as guard duty or
waiting tables), one may not accept payment for it on Shabbat (BM        <em> </em>58a; SA 306:4). It is also forbidden to accept rent money for
        anything, whether real estate or objects, that had been rented out on
        Shabbat (MB 246:3). Even <em>be-di’avad</em>, one may not benefit from
        money paid for any service rendered on Shabbat (SA 245:6; MB 243:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, payment for work done on Shabbat may be subsumed within
        weekday payment. For example, an agreement may stipulate that a worker
        will do guard duty or wait tables for a few hours after Shabbat as well
        as on Shabbat itself. Even though, in reality, most of the hours were
        on Shabbat and the payment is primarily for those hours, as long as an
        agreement was reached before the work started that the employee would
        also work on Saturday night, the compensation covers the hours worked
        during the week as well as those on Shabbat. Thus, the Shabbat payment
        is subsumed within the weekday payment. However, if an agreement was
        not reached before the work started, then even if the employee did work
        after Shabbat as well, each workday stands on its own, the payment for
        Shabbat work cannot be subsumed within the payment for weekday work,
        and the worker thus may not accept the payment (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em>
        60:8; MB 306:21; SSK 28:64-68).
    </p>
    <p>
        Along the same lines, one may rent out a room for Shabbat, as long as
        the rental period includes time either on Friday before Shabbat begins
        or on Saturday night after Shabbat ends. A cab driver can rent out his
        cab to a non-Jew for Shabbat, as long as the rental period either
        begins before Shabbat or extends after Shabbat, so that the Shabbat
        payment can be subsumed within the weekday payment. One may also
        collect interest on one’s bank account, since the calculations are
        based on the calendar day and not the times that Shabbat starts and
        ends. Accordingly, whatever is earned over Shabbat can be seen as
        subsumed within the weekday earnings of Friday morning and afternoon
        and Saturday night.
    </p>
    <p>
One who immerses in a <em>mikveh</em> on Shabbat may pay the        <em>mikveh</em> fee after Shabbat. There are two reasons for this.
        First, it is for the sake of a mitzva, and second, the payment is not
for the immersion itself, but for the cleaning and heating of the        <em>mikveh</em>, which started before Shabbat.

    </p>
    <p>
        One may give a gift on Saturday night to someone who worked voluntarily
        over Shabbat. Examples include one who set up the synagogue and one who
        served as a waiter at a Shabbat meal. Since there is no obligation to
compensate him at all, whatever is given is not considered payment (        <em>Pri Megadim</em>; MB 306:15).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether one may accept payment for
        serving as a <em>ĥazan</em> or for other mitzva-related jobs undertaken
        on Shabbat. Some say that even when a job involves a mitzva, one may
        not accept payment for it. If this is correct, a <em>ĥazan</em> may not
        be paid for leading the services on Shabbat. Others maintain that one
        may be paid for a mitzva-related job on Shabbat, but that nothing good
        will come of this income. In practice, it is proper to stipulate that
        any payment will also include work performed during the week. For
        example, a <em>ĥazan</em> will be paid for practicing before he leads
        the Shabbat services, or for an additional prayer service that he will
        lead during the week. This way the Shabbat payment can be subsumed
        within the weekday payment (SA and Rema 306:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        A doctor who is on call to provide medical care during Shabbat is
        entitled to demand payment after Shabbat. The reason is that if he
        cannot assume that he will be paid, he might refuse to provide care in
        the future (MB 306:24; <em>Minĥat Shabbat</em> 90:19; SSK 28:75).

        15. Preparing on Shabbat for Weekdays, and Cleaning Up the House and
        Table
    </h2>
    <p>
        Shabbat is meant to bring holiness and rest into our lives. Making
        efforts on Shabbat to prepare for the week belittles its honor, and
        therefore the Sages forbade doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, one may not make the beds on Shabbat in preparation for going to
        sleep on Saturday night. However, one may make the beds on Shabbat so
        that the bedroom will look nice on Shabbat. Similarly, one may clear
        off a table so that one’s home will look nice on Shabbat. For the same
        reason, if <em>se’uda shlishit</em> is finished well before the end of
        Shabbat, one may clear the table and put the dishes in the sink.
        However, if <em>se’uda shlishit</em> finishes only a few minutes before
        the end of Shabbat, or if people are not planning to remain in the room
        where it was served, so that clearing off the table is not for
        Shabbat’s sake but for the week’s sake, one may not clear off the
        table. One who does so is expending effort on Shabbat to prepare for
        afterward (<em>m. Shabbat</em> 113a; MB 302:19).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may wash dishes if they will be used again at some point on
        Shabbat. If many dishes were used, and only one cup is needed for later
        Shabbat use but there are no more clean cups, one may wash all the
        cups, since he could use any of them. Similarly, if he needs one plate
        but none are clean, he may wash all the plates and use one of them.
        However, if he does not intend to use any of them during Shabbat, he
        may not wash any of them (<em>Shabbat</em> 118a; SA 323:6; MB 323:26).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who never leaves dirty dishes in the sink even during the week, and
        who feels that a pile of dirty dishes left in the sink for hours
        belittles the honor of Shabbat, may wash the dishes even if they will
        not be used again during Shabbat, so that his home will be clean in
        honor of Shabbat. However, even in this case, he may not wash the pots,
since they are <em>muktzeh</em> and require burdensome work (        <em>Responsa Maharshag</em>, OĤ 1:61; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:37).
        (We have already seen in 13:4-5 how to clean off a table that water or
        juice spilled on, and in 15:9 how to clean the floor.)
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not fold a <em>talit</em> so that it will be unwrinkled for
        next Shabbat. However, one may fold it so that it will not be left out
        on Shabbat in a disrespectful way (see above 13:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not prepare on Shabbat for weekdays even when a mitzva is
        involved. For example, one may not roll a Torah scroll to the passage
        that will be read during the upcoming week or the next Shabbat (MB
        667:5). If necessary, one may roll the Torah scroll to the next reading
        and then study a few verses from it, so that the rolling will serve a
        purpose on Shabbat as well (AHS 667:2). One may bring a book to the
        synagogue if it is needed after Shabbat, as long as one studies a bit
        from it on Shabbat as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Shabbat one may study for a test in a Torah subject that is
        scheduled for the upcoming week, since studying these topics is itself
        a mitzva. However, it is proper not to study on Shabbat for tests in
        secular subjects. First, Shabbat must be dedicated to Torah study.
        Second, the student’s primary goal in studying is to succeed on his
        test, not to become more knowledgeable. In a time of need one may be
        lenient, since there is intrinsic value to secular studies. In
        contrast, one may not study a foreign language on Shabbat, because such
        study has no intrinsic value. It is also prohibited to study for a test
        in a subject that normally involves writing exercises, because (as we
        saw) one may read on Shabbat only when there is no concern that one
        might end up writing or erasing.
    </p>
    <p>
        One should not say on Shabbat, "I will go to sleep now, so that I will
        have energy after Shabbat." This belittles Shabbat, since he is using
        it to prepare for weekdays. However, if he does not verbalize this but
        only thinks it, it is not forbidden, since sleeping on Shabbat is a
        pleasure (<em>Sefer Ĥasidim</em>; MB 290:4; see above 5:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        When Yom Tov follows Shabbat, one may not prepare on Shabbat for Yom
        Tov. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if one prepared something on Shabbat for
        afterward, he may benefit from his actions.
    </p>
    <a name="16"></a><h2>
        16. When Preparation on Shabbat for the Weekday Is Permitted
    </h2>
    <p>
        The prohibition of preparing on Shabbat for the weekday is limited to
        activities that require effort. However, easy, effortless activities
        that people routinely undertake are permitted. This is true even if the
        activities are useful for the weekday, as doing them does not belittle
        Shabbat. For example, after shaking the <em>lulav</em> on the first day
        of Sukkot, one may put it back in water, even though this is done to
        keep it fresh for the next day (<em>Sukka</em> 42a; SA 654:1). One who
        is studying Torah may insert a bookmark, even though this will not be
helpful until he continues his studies during the week. One who took a<em>siddur</em> to the synagogue may bring it home (where there is an        <em>eruv</em>), even if he will not be using it again on that Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one may put leftover food in the refrigerator as usual.
        Dishes may be left soaking in water as usual to prevent food remnants
        getting stuck to them. One leaving the house on Shabbat afternoon may
        take a key and sweater with him for use after Shabbat, though he should
        not state explicitly that he is doing so for after Shabbat (see SA
        416:2; SSK 28:89).
    </p>
    <p>
        In a time of need, in order to avoid serious inconvenience, one may do
        simple things on Shabbat in preparation for the weekday even if they
        are not part of the normal routine, but only on condition that it is
        not obvious that he is doing them for the weekday, so as not to
        belittle Shabbat. For example, if one is going to a place where it is
        difficult to find wine for <em>havdala</em>, he may bring wine with him
        on Shabbat, on condition that he brings it while there is still plenty
        of daylight left, so that it will not be obvious that he is bringing
the wine for after Shabbat. If he drinks some of the wine at        <em>se’uda shlishit</em>, he may even bring wine <em>le-khatĥila</em>
        (see <em>Ĥayei Adam </em>153:6; MB 667:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        In a time of need, in order to prevent a loss, the Sages permitted
        doing things on Shabbat even when it is obvious that they are for the
        weekday. Examples include bringing in items from outside and that would
        likely be damaged by rain, and putting food into the freezer if it
        would likely spoil if left out (SA 308:4; MB 321:21).

    <a name="17"></a><h2>
        17. Playing Musical Instruments and Producing Sound
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages prohibited playing instruments on Shabbat and Yom Tov, lest
        the instrument break and the player fix it, thus violating Torah law
(MT 23:4). In contrast, in the Temple, rabbinic Shabbat prohibitions (        <em>shvut</em>) did not apply; therefore, even on Shabbat and holidays,
        the Levites would accompany offerings with flutes, harps, lyres,
        trumpets, and cymbals (<em>Beitza</em> 11b).
    </p>
    <p>
        Included in the prohibition of playing musical instruments is the
        prohibition of blowing a shofar. Even on Rosh Ha-shana, once the mitzva
        of shofar has been fulfilled in the optimal and most beautiful fashion,
        we do not blow further. Children under the age of bar mitzva may blow
        the shofar all day on Rosh Ha-shana so that they can learn how to do it
        (Rema 596:1; MB 3-5).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may produce sound that is not musical in nature. Thus, one may clap
        his hands to wake someone up, knock on a door with his hands or an
        instrument so that the people inside will hear and open up, or tap a
        glass or bottle with a spoon to quiet a crowd. One may also snap in
        order to wake someone up or to make a baby laugh (SA 338:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether one may use a door knocker or
        mechanical bell. Some forbid it on the grounds that it resembles a
        musical instrument too closely (Rema). Others permit it since one is
        not trying to make music (SA 338:1). If during the week an electric
        doorbell is used, then on Shabbat a mechanical doorbell or knocker may
        be used (MB 338:7).
        <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may place a decorative crown with bells on a Torah scroll even
        though the bells produce sound. Since they are decorative and honor the
        Torah, it is for the sake of a mitzva, and since the person carrying
the Torah does not intend to make noise, it is not forbidden (        <em>Shakh</em> and MA, as opposed to <em>Taz</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some forbid opening a door that has bells or chimes attached to it,
since they are considered musical instruments (<em>Taz</em> and        <em>Eliya Rabba</em>). Others permit it, because those entering do not
intend to make noise, they just want to open the door (MA).        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, it is proper for homeowners to remove bells from
        the door before Shabbat; if they did not do so, the door may still be
        used (see MB 338:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may whistle on Shabbat because it is considered a type of music
        made with the mouth, not with an instrument. Some even permit using
        one’s fingers to improve the whistle (AHS 338:7; see below in 24:7
        about toys that make noise).
    </p>
    <a name="18"></a><h2>
        18. Clapping and Dancing
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages’ prohibition of playing instruments includes dancing,
        clapping, and slapping one’s thigh with one’s hands to accompany
singing out of concern lest one play an instrument and fix it (        <em>Beitza</em> 36b). However, one may clap with a <em>shinui</em>,
such as<em> </em>using the back of one’s hand; by using a        <em>shinui</em>, he is reminded that it is Shabbat and will not end up
        fixing an instrument (<em>y. Beitza</em> 5:2). It would seem that very
        muted dancing, in which one’s feet never leave the ground at the same
        time, is not included in the prohibited dancing (<em>ibid.</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition applies specifically while singing, because there is a
        concern then that it will lead to playing instruments. In contrast, if
        there is no singing, one may jump a bit for his enjoyment. Similarly,
        one may clap or to bang on a table in order to wake someone up.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, many observant Jews dance, clap, and bang on a table when
        they sing on Shabbat. The <em>poskim</em> disagree about the legitimacy
        of this practice, as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
        One approach, that of many <em>poskim</em>, is that this practice is
        mistaken. The only reason that the Sages did not object is that the
        prohibition is not stated explicitly in the Torah, so it is better that
        people transgress unknowingly rather than knowingly (<em>Beitza</em>
        30a). However, if there is any possibility that people can be convinced
        to accept the proper <em>halakha</em>, we must teach them not to clap
        or dance on Shabbat, in accordance with the rabbinic enactment (Rif;
        Rambam; Rema 339:3). Nevertheless, on Simĥat Torah, when there is a
        special mitzva to rejoice and honor the Torah, even those who are
        normally stringent dance and clap (Maharik in the name of R. Hai Gaon).
        However, for other celebrations with a mitzva component, such as
        weddings, they are not lenient (MB 339:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        A second approach defends the leniency. After all, the reason behind
        the prohibition is a concern that people will end up fixing a musical
        instrument. Nowadays, when those who play an instrument do not know how
        to fix it, the enactment no longer applies, and one may dance and clap
        on Shabbat (<em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Beitza</em> 30a, s.v. "tenan"). Some
        do not accept this, maintaining that all the players know how to tune
        their instrument (tightening guitar strings, harp strings, or the top
        of a drum), which is considered fixing an instrument. However, there is
        a different reason to be lenient. Some maintain that the rabbinic
        enactment was specifically relevant to the times of the Sages, when
        people would take out instruments whenever there was dancing and
        clapping. Nowadays, when many people sing, dance, and clap without
        instruments, the enactment no longer applies (AHS 339:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        A third approach notes that the great Ĥasidic masters of recent
        centuries focused on the value of music and dance to awaken people’s
        hearts to cling to God joyfully. Such dancing and clapping are
        considered true mitzva needs. Accordingly, just as there is a leniency
for Simĥat Torah, there should be a leniency for every Shabbat (        <em>Devar Yehoshua</em> 2:42:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        It would seem that even those who are lenient should not drum on the
        table on Shabbat. Such drumming is very similar to that of an actual
        drum, which all agree is forbidden, even for the sake of a mitzva.
        Furthermore, the concern that people will take out a drum is a serious
        one today, when many are used to bringing drums, darbukas, and the like
        when they sing. In contrast, when people are singing during prayer, a
        leader may drum with his hand on the <em>bima</em>. One leading the
        songs at the Shabbat table may also be lenient.

    <a name="19"></a><h2>
        19. Music and Films on Electronic Devices
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is a clear consensus among <em>poskim</em> that one may not
        listen to the radio or watch television on Shabbat. Even if the radio
        or television is turned on before Shabbat so that no <em>melakha</em>
        is performed on Shabbat, it is forbidden, and for several reasons.
        First, if there are Jews who work at the station, one may not derive
        enjoyment from Shabbat desecration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, even if all the station’s workers are non-Jewish, one may not
        listen to or watch broadcasts because it belittles and detracts from
        the honor of Shabbat. We already saw (2:9) that some maintain that one
        may not leave a flour mill running before Shabbat if it will continue
        to run on Shabbat, because the noise of the grinding detracts from the
        honor of Shabbat. Listening to the radio and watching television are
        much more serious. While the mill makes noise that no one wants to
        hear, one who turns on the radio or television before Shabbat indeed
        wishes to listen or watch on the holy Shabbat. All would agree that
        this infringes upon Shabbat’s honor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third, it is a weekday activity. Just as the prophets and Sages forbade
        many things that are reminiscent of weekdays, so that our behavior on
        Shabbat would be different from that of the workweek, so too we should
        prohibit listening to the radio and watching television on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fourth, there is a concern that the radio or television might
        malfunction, and the listeners or viewers might try to fix it on
        Shabbat. One might want to raise or lower the volume or adjust the
        device in some other way (see above 17:2). A similar concern led to the
        ban on using musical instruments, and the same ban should apply.
    </p>
    <p>
        For all these reasons, one may not listen to radio or watch television
        on Shabbat, even when they are turned on before Shabbat. For the same
        reasons, it is also forbidden to set a timer to turn on a recording
        device or video or audio player (see <em>Yesodei Yeshurun</em> vol. 3,
        pp. 50-55; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 3:16; SSK 42:43; <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>
        1:20; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:34-38).

When I wrote above that only the owner of the produce or his            <em>shali’aĥ</em> may tithe on Shabbat by means of this procedure,
            this applies to cases where the produce definitely has not been
            tithed yet (<em>tevel</em>). However, if it is uncertain whether
            the produce was tithed (<em>demai</em>), someone else can tithe
            this way as well (<em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 22:65-70). The formula
            recited before Shabbat is the usual one, but all the words should
be changed to the future tense, e.g., "What I will tithe" (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em>, <em>Demai</em>, 9:13:15 as quoted in            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 22:62 and n. 86). <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if
one simply says, "Whatever I separate tomorrow should be considered            <em>teruma </em>and <em>ma’aser</em>," he has fulfilled his
            obligation, as he has begun the process of separation before
            Shabbat (see SSK 11:23). After the tithes are actually set aside,
            he may not move them, as they are <em>muktzeh</em>.

According to <em>Beit Yosef</em>, in a time of need one may immerse            <em>kelim </em>on Shabbat. Rambam too is lenient, following Rif;
and SA 323:7 implies this as well. Maharam ibn Ĥabib writes in            <em>Responsa</em> <em>Kol Gadol</em> §15 that the immersion should
            be done with a <em>berakha</em> (<em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §§72, 75).
            Others (<em>Zivĥei Tzedek</em>, AHS) maintain that we see from SA
            YD 120:16 that R. Yosef Karo retracted, and the only solution is to
            have a non-Jew acquire the <em>kli </em>(so that it is not owned by
a Jew). Rema in <em>Darkhei Moshe</em> is stringent, as is<em>Sha’agat Aryeh</em> §56. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if a            <em>kli </em>was immersed on Shabbat, it may be used (MA; MB
323:33). BHL has a thorough analysis of this issue. If the            <em>kli </em>still belongs to a non-Jew but is in the possession of
            a Jew, it should be immersed without a <em>berakha</em>. Therefore,
            it is proper to ask the non-Jew to return the item to him as a gift
            so he may immerse it with a <em>berakha</em> (<em>Taz</em>; MB
            323:35).

            According to <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:36:12, exercise is forbidden
            only when undertaken in order to sweat to improve health, but one
            may run for callisthenic exercise just as youths may run for
            pleasure (based on Rambam, and as opposed to Rashi; see BHL
            328:42). However, in practice, it would seem that exercise is, in
some way, a weekday activity, as we can see from            <em>t. Shabbat</em> 17:16, which states: "One may not run on
            Shabbat for exercise; but walking in the usual fashion, even all
            day long, is no problem." Even though youths who enjoy running may
            run, this is because they enjoy the running itself; but when the
            pleasure is derived from improving one’s health, it is prohibited.
            This is made explicit in SA 301:1-2; <em>Taz</em> <em>ad loc.</em>
1; AHS<em> ad loc.</em> 44. It is also the position of            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 6:4 and SSK 34:22. One who enjoys the
            exercise itself may exercise (<em>Melamed Le-ho’il</em>, OĤ 53; R.
            Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in SSK ch. 16 n. 106) on condition that he
            does not do so in an organized and professional way, which would
            qualify it as a weekday activity. It would also seem that an adult
            who enjoys running may not run outside, because it seems to
belittle Shabbat and is consequently deemed a weekday activity. See            <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            However, <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em> permits riding a bicycle. It explains
            that we need not be concerned that people will mistakenly conclude
            that one may ride in vehicles drawn by humans or animals.
Furthermore, we do not have the right to enact new decrees (<em>Responsa Rav Pe’alim</em> 1:25). Nevertheless, almost all<em>poskim</em> are stringent, for the reasons mentioned above (<em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> §110, <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan </em>§16;<em>Yaskil Avdi</em> 3:19; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 7:30;            <em>She’elat Yaakov</em> §45; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 404:8; SSK
            16:18). <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:42:1 adds that though it is
            technically possible to permit, since the widespread practice is to
            forbid bike riding, it is forbidden.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who maintain that riding a bicycle is a weekday activity can
            find support in <em>Beitza</em> 25b: "The Rabbis taught: The blind
            do not go out [on Yom Tov] with their canes, nor do we go out with
            a chair." Rashi explains that since canes were considered weekday
            items, going out with them would belittle Yom Tov. He adds that the
            chair in question is a sedan chair (litter) carried by people. The
            Gemara specifies that the prohibition on carrying the chair applies
            when people lift it up on their shoulders (as opposed to holding it
            lower down). Rashi explains that when a chair is carried on the
            shoulders it looks like a weekday activity, it is more public, and
            it indicates that the chair is being carried further.

            The prohibition on walking to the edge of the <em>teĥum</em> on
            Shabbat applies when going to do something that cannot be done
            permissibly on Shabbat. However, if his objective is to collect
            already-picked fruits that are outside the <em>teĥum</em>, or to
            visit relatives who live outside the <em>teĥum</em>, the walking is
            permitted, as there is no essential prohibition involved (after
            all, if there were an <em>eruv</em>, he would be permitted to
            undertake these activities even on Shabbat). In contrast, one may
            not walk to the edge of the <em>teĥum</em> on Shabbat with the goal
            of picking fruits or collecting <em>muktzeh </em>fruits after
            Shabbat, because the act is fundamentally prohibited (there is no
            way to undertake these activities permissibly on Shabbat). A
            similar principle governs the prohibition of speech, as described
            in the next section. One may speak about an activity if it can be
done on Shabbat in a permissible way, such as if there were an            <em>eruv</em>. So, one may speak on Shabbat of plans to visit an
area the next day in order to collect fruit from there (<em>Shabbat</em> 150b; SA 307:8; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 35. SAH,<em>ad loc.</em> 16 explains the basis of the permission.            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 22 n. 7 suggests additional reasons for
            it).

            If there is a great need to speak on Shabbat about business matters
            (for example, if one encounters a person with whom he will not be
            able to meet on a weekday, and if he does not speak with him he
            will suffer a great loss), he may talk about business matters as
            long as he uses a <em>shinui</em> when choosing his words. For
            example, he should speak of a hundred challahs rather than a
            hundred dollars (<em>Eshel Avraham </em>[Buczacz] §307). As with
            any rabbinic prohibition on Shabbat, using a <em>shinui</em>
            reduces it to a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, and is permitted in order
            to prevent a great loss (<em>She’arim Metzuyanim Ba-halakha</em>

            According to Rambam, only Torah material may be read on Shabbat.
            All other reading materials are forbidden out of concern that
            people will end up writing. In contrast, Rashi, Ri, Rosh, Ramban,
            and Rashba maintain that the original prohibition was limited to
            reading material dealing with business or other things that are
            forbidden on Shabbat. The Sages extended this prohibition to
            include stories or material with no value, to make it less likely
            that people will read the previously prohibited material. The
majority of <em>poskim</em> follow this lenient approach (            <em>Baĥ</em> 307:5; SAH 307:21-22; MB 307:52; SSK 29:48-49). The
            Gemara forbids reading captions under pictures, and this includes
            mundane stories as well (<em>Shabbat</em> 149a; SA 307:15).
            According to <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em> and SAH, even one who
enjoys them may not read them, but according to MA 301:4,            <em>Birkei Yosef</em>, <em>Pri Megadim</em>, and Maharsham, he may
            read occasionally. Disturbing material, no matter how gripping,
            should not be read (see MB 307:3).

        <p>
            <em>She’elat Ya’avetz</em>
            1:162 states that while technically one may read newspapers, in
            practice it is proper to forbid it lest people end up reading
prohibited material. MB 307:63 states similarly, while<em>Shvut Yaakov</em> 3:13 is permissive. See SSK 29:48 and            <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            Ĥida is inclined to forbid playing chess (<em>Birkei Yosef</em>
            338:1). He suggests that the rabbis who played chess on Shabbat
            were suffering from depression. In order to take their minds off
            their worries, they played chess, after which they were able to
            return to their Torah study. However, barring this situation, one
            should not play on Shabbat. The Sages tell us that there was a
            place named Tur Shimon that was destroyed even though the people
            there respected Shabbat. Some say the reason was that they played
            ball there on Shabbat (<em>y. Ta’anit</em> 4:5). R. Elazar of Worms
            explains that by playing games they were wasting time during which
            they would have been learning Torah (<em>Roke’aĥ</em> §55). Based
            on this, some conclude that one may not play ball on Shabbat, and
that therefore balls are <em>muktzeh</em> (            <em>Shibolei Ha-leket</em>, <em>Beit Yosef</em>, and SA 308:45).
            Others are permissive and maintain that one may play ball in a
            paved yard (<em>Tosafot</em>, Rema). Nevertheless, one may not play
            on an unpaved surface, out of concern that people will end up
            leveling the ground (above 15:2). As for the punishment of Tur
            Shimon, that was because they were playing ball in the public
            domain (Vilna Gaon), or because they were taking away too much time
            from their Torah study.

            If Shabbat is followed by Yom Tov or vice versa, there is an entire
            calendar day that is sanctified, and yet one is receiving interest
then. At first glance this would seem to be forbidden (            <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 9:59; <em>Be-tzel Ha-ĥokhma</em> 3:38).
            Nevertheless, this too is permissible because interest is not
            actually paid daily, but rather all the days are calculated
            together. Accordingly, the interest in this case can be subsumed
within the times before and after the holy days (see<em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:10:30 with n. 69, and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, p. 133). Similarly, MB 306:20 cites
            an opinion that payment for Shabbat work is subsumed within payment
            for weekday work even if an agreement was not reached before the
            work started if it is likely that the work under the agreement will
            continue during the week.

            A waiter may not work on Shabbat with the understanding that his
            employer will in turn work for him in a different capacity, because
            working for someone is considered payment. However, one may do
            guard duty on Shabbat for a friend and arrange for this friend to
            cover his assigned guard duty elsewhere, because guard duty that
            prevents loss is not considered payment (SA 307:10). Similarly, one
            may babysit a family on Shabbat with the understanding that the
            second person will babysit for the first person’s family at some
            point in the future (SSK 28:59). If it is one’s turn to set up the
            dining hall and serve the food on Shabbat, he may switch his
            Shabbat slot for a different slot. Since there is no monetary
            compensation involved, swapping is not considered payment (SSK
            28:61).

        <p>
            As written above, one who immerses in a <em>mikveh</em> on Shabbat
            may pay after Shabbat because the payment is for the cleaning and
heating done before Shabbat begins (<em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>,            <em>Mahadura Tinyana</em>, OĤ 26; SSK 28:72). One can also be
            lenient and rent an apartment for Shabbat only, since it can be
            argued that the rent also covers the cleaning that takes place
            before Shabbat (SSK 28:70). It is important to know that in a time
            of need, when a large loss is at stake, one may accept payment for
            work done on Shabbat (Rema 244:6; BHL s.v. "de-bimkom").

            If slaughtered meat is left unsalted for three days, it can no
            longer be rendered kosher through salting. However, if the meat is
            soaked in water before the three days end, the window for salting
            is extended. According to MA 321:7, one may not soak unsalted meat
            whose time is running out and soak it on Shabbat to make sure that
            it will be permissible to cook after Shabbat, because it is
            forbidden to deal with something on Shabbat in order to prevent
            loss after Shabbat. However, MB 321:21 adds that under pressing
circumstances, one may rely on <em>Eliya Rabba</em> and            <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>, which permit it. This is also the opinion
            of SSK 28:91 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, p. 218.

            <em>Eruvin</em>
            104a records a disagreement about this issue. According to Ula, one
            may not produce sound on Shabbat even without intent to make music.
            Therefore, one may not knock on the door so that the people inside
            will hear him. Rava maintains that only producing sound with the
            goal of creating music is prohibited. The Yerushalmi tells the
            story of R. Ila’i, who returned home on Friday night and called out
            to the members of his household to let him in. They did not hear
            him. Since he was personally stringent not to knock, he slept
            outside (<em>y. Beitza </em>5:2). Indeed, Rabbeinu Ĥananel and the
            Vilna Gaon rule in accordance with Ula’s strict approach. In any
            case, even according to them, knocking with a <em>shinui</em> is
            permitted (BHL 338:1 s.v. "aval"). However, based on the subsequent
            discussion in the Gemara, Rif and Rambam (MT 23:4) conclude that
            the law is in accordance with the lenient approach of Rava. Rosh is
            inclined to follow this as well. Almost all the <em>poskim</em>
            follow the lenient approach, including SA 338:1, MB <em>ad loc</em>
            . 2-3, and SSK 28:41. However, regarding a door knocker, an
instrument designed to produce sound, Maharil is stringent.            <em>Beit Yosef</em> suggests that Maharil’s stringency is due to
            the concern that the person knocking may in fact intend to produce
            music. Rema 338:1 is stringent, following Maharil. According to BHL
338:1 s.v. "ho’il," this is the position of SA as well. However,            <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §110 and <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:39:1 argue
            that according to SA, one may use a door knocker. If the knocker is
            meant to be used only on Shabbat, then Rema permits it as well (MB
            338:7; <em>Shevet Ha-Levi</em> 9:76). Therefore, one may use a
            mechanical doorbell on Shabbat if an electric one is used during
            the week (SSK 23:55 with n. 159).

            A <em>ĥazan</em> may not use a tuning fork to help him determine
            the pitch for his singing, because it is included in the
            prohibition on musical instruments (MB 338:4). While some are
            permissive, since a tuning fork produces a sound that is uniform
            and relatively quiet, and it is being used for the sake of a
            mitzva, it is proper to be stringent, because that is the opinion
            of almost all the <em>poskim</em>. If one wishes to rely on those
            who are lenient, it is not necessary to object (AHS<em> </em>338:8;
            see <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 3:22).

            As we said above, on Simĥat Torah all customarily clap and dance
based on the opinion of R. Hai Gaon as cited by Maharik and            <em>Beit Yosef</em> 339:3. However, the <em>poskim</em> do not
            apply this leniency to other mitzva situations (SA 339:3). Rema is
            inclined to follow this as well, commenting that the reason we do
            not object to those who clap and dance on Shabbat is that it is
            better that people transgress unknowingly rather than knowingly.
However, Rema cites as an alternative the lenient approach of            <em>Tosafot</em>, namely, that nowadays there is no reason to be
concerned that people will end up fixing a musical instrument.            <em>Yam Shel Shlomo</em> (<em>Beitza</em> 5:6) seems to state that
            technically one may rely on <em>Tosafot</em> when it is in the
            service of a mitzva. This opinion is quoted in <em>Eliya Rabba</em>
            339:1 and MB <em>ad loc</em>. 10. (See SHT 339:6-7.) Based on the
logic of this approach, Ĥasidim are customarily lenient (            <em>Devar Yehoshua</em> 2:42:4; <em>Minĥat Elazar</em> 1:29).
            Sephardim may rely on this reasoning as well for the sake of a
            mitzva (see <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:43:9 and <em>Harĥavot</em>.)
            However, the leniency pertains to dancing and clapping - both of
            which are done with the body - and not to drumming on something
else (<em>Eliya Rabba</em> 339:1; MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 10;            <em>Avnei Yashfe</em> 2:35:1). The reasoning is straightforward.
            Drumming on a table is similar to playing a drum, which is a
musical instrument. Nevertheless, when it comes to a            <em>gabbai</em> leading the congregation in song, there are two
reasons to be lenient and allow him to drum with his hand on the            <em>bima</em>. First, this is more clearly for the sake of a
            mitzva, and we already saw that R. Hai Gaon and Maharik are lenient
for the sake of Simĥat Torah (see SHT 339:7). Second, since the            <em>gabbai</em> is in the middle of the congregation, we are not
            worried that he might bring instruments that will need to be fixed.
            Perhaps this is also one of the reasons for the leniency on Simĥat
            Torah<em>.</em> The logic is similar to that of the permission for
            two people to read by candlelight (<em>Shabbat</em> 12b), or for
            even one person to read by candlelight as long as his friend is
            there to make sure he will not unknowingly do anything that would
affect the flame (SA 275:3). This also explains why            <em>Sha’arei De’a</em> (YD 282) allows putting a crown with bells
on a Torah scroll (as opposed to <em>Taz</em>; see            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 3:22). Perhaps we can extend the leniency to
            leading the singing at the Shabbat table, and allow one to drum
            with his hand on the table. Nevertheless, it is not proper for the
            rest of the participants to drum. Besides, their drumming is not
            always for the sake of the mitzva, as often these additional
            drummers actually make it harder to sing because they are out of
            sync with the song.
