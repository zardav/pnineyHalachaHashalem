        1. The Principles of <em>Piku’aĥ Nefesh</em> (Saving a Life)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Saving a life overrides Shabbat, as the Torah states: "Keep My decrees
        and laws, which a person shall do and live by; I am the Lord" (Vayikra
        18:5). The Sages expound: "‘live by’ - and not die by" (<em>Yoma</em>
        85b); the <em>mitzvot </em>of the Torah were given so that people may
        live by them, not die to fulfill them.

    </p>
    <p>
        We desecrate Shabbat to attempt a rescue, even if the chances of its
        success are slim. Thus, we desecrate Shabbat to bring someone
        medication, even if it works in only a small percentage of cases, and
        even if it is an experimental drug that might not be effective.
        However, we do not desecrate Shabbat to acquire a drug if there is no
        substantive reason to think that it might help (MA 328:1; Rema, YD
        155:3; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 20:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        In a case of uncertainty, we still desecrate Shabbat. For example, if a
        building collapses, and we do not know whether anyone was inside, and
        even if someone was inside, we do not know whether he is still alive,
        we clear away the rubble on Shabbat despite the uncertainty (SA
329:2-5). The act of clearing rubble ("        <strong><em>mefakĥin</em></strong><em> et ha-gal</em>") lends its name
to the general category of <strong><em>piku’aĥ</em></strong>        <em> nefesh</em>, which overrides Shabbat. <em> </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if a rescue attempt fails, God rewards all who made an effort.
        Similarly, if several people drove to different places to obtain a
        certain medicine that someone needed, they all receive divine reward,
        even though some of them traveled for naught (<em>Menaĥot</em> 64a; SA
        328:15).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though one may desecrate Shabbat to save a sick person, one who
        knows that he will need to care for a dangerously sick person on
Shabbat should prepare as much as possible beforehand to minimize the        <em>melakhot</em> he will perform on Shabbat, since one must prepare
        for Shabbat before Shabbat (MB 344:11). If it is uncertain whether one
        will need to care for a sick person on Shabbat, it is good for him to
        prepare before Shabbat, though it is not obligatory (MB 330:1). For
        instance, if one sometimes is called upon to care for the wounded, he
        should preferably prepare adhesive and cloth bandages before Shabbat so
        that he will not have to cut them on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is good for a woman who is due to give birth to prepare her hospital
        bag before Shabbat. If the expectant couple is planning to drive to the
        hospital in their car, they should preferably remove unnecessary items
        from the car before Shabbat. However, the expectant mother does not
        need to spend the <em>Shabbatot</em> near her due date close to the
        hospital, as that is an excessive burden that one is not required to
        undertake on Friday. If she has to travel to the hospital on Shabbat,
        she may do so, since saving a life overrides Shabbat (SSK 32:34 and
        36:6-7).
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. Determining Danger
    </h2>
    <p>
        Any illness that doctors normally consider dangerous or that regular
        people would make haste to save a patient suffering from it is deemed
        dangerous halakhically, even if only a small minority of people die
        because of it, and therefore justifies desecrating Shabbat. Thus, one
        may drive a woman in labor to the hospital, even though in a clear
majority of cases she can safely give birth at home (        <em>Magid Mishneh</em> 2:11). However, one may not desecrate Shabbat on
        account of illnesses and risks that are generally not considered
        dangerous (<em>Shevet Mi-Yehuda</em> 1:19:2; SSK ch. 32 nn. 2 and 23).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages defined certain conditions as dangerous. These include
        internal injuries (severe pains or wounds or internal bleeding);
        injuries on the back of the hand and foot (that is, infections and
        dangerous cuts); very high fevers; scorpion or snake bites; and eye
        afflictions (SA 328:3-9). The Sages determined all of these cases based
        on experience, and today’s doctors agree in principle, though they use
        different terminology to describe the conditions. This is not the place
        to expand on the definition of a life-threatening condition, but there
        is a general principle: If those present think that the ill or injured
        party might be in mortal danger, they immediately do whatever is
        necessary to help him. If they need to call a doctor, they should do
        so; if they need to drive him to the hospital, they should do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the people nearby do not know whether the patient might be in
        danger, they should ask a doctor, nurse, or medic in the vicinity, or
        they should call a doctor. If the doctor thinks that the patient might
        be in mortal danger, even if the patient claims that his condition is
        not dangerous, they must heed the doctor (SA 328:10 and 618:1, 5).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the patient maintains that he is in danger, then even if the doctor
        thinks he is not, we must desecrate Shabbat and take him to the
        hospital to be examined. This is because "The heart knows its own
        bitterness" (Mishlei 14:10), meaning that sometimes only the patient
        can assess his own condition. Similarly, if a sick person demands a
        certain medicine or treatment that, based on his experience, could save
        his life, we heed him (SA 618:1). We only rely on the patient’s
        intuition on condition that it makes some sense. However, if his
        illness is known and he demands a treatment that the doctors believe is
        ineffective, we heed the doctors (BHL 328:10, s.v. "ve-rofe").
        Similarly, if the sick person is known to be hypochondriac or
        excessively fearful and a medically knowledgeable person is certain
        that he is not in any danger, we do not desecrate Shabbat on his
        account.
    </p>
    <p>
        If, in an effort to be pious, one asks a rabbi whether to desecrate
        Shabbat in order to help someone in mortal danger, he is a killer, for
        while he is asking, the patient’s situation may deteriorate, and the
        Torah commands us: "Do not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor"
        (Vayikra 19:16). Furthermore, the rabbi whose students ask such
        questions is reprehensible, as he should have taught them that saving a
        life overrides Shabbat (<em>y.</em> <em>Yoma</em> 8:5; MB 328:6).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. For Whom Do We Desecrate Shabbat?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages offered a rationale for desecrating Shabbat to save someone’s
life: "Desecrate one Shabbat so that he will observe many        <em>Shabbatot</em>" (<em>Yoma</em> 85b). However, in practice, even
        when it is clear that the person being saved will not observe Shabbat,
        one is commanded to desecrate Shabbat to save him because the Torah
        strives to increase life. Therefore, we desecrate Shabbat to save a
        mentally impaired person (<em>shoteh</em>), who is exempt from
        observing the <em>mitzvot</em>. Similarly, we desecrate Shabbat for
        someone who is unconscious and about to die, in order to prolong his
        life for a short while (BHL 329:4, s.v. "ela").
    </p>
    <p>
        We desecrate Shabbat in order to save an unborn fetus, even if forty
        days have not yet passed since conception (<em>Behag</em>; Ritva; BHL
        330:7, end of s.v. "o"). Similarly, we desecrate Shabbat to save a
        premature baby. Although in the past it was forbidden to desecrate
        Shabbat to save a baby born in the eighth month, whose nails and hair
        had not yet grown in, as it was certain that it would not survive,
        nowadays, with the improvement of medicine and the invention of the
        incubator, whenever doctors assess that the baby has a chance of
        long-term survival, we desecrate Shabbat to save him. (See SA 330:7-8;
        SSK 36:12 and n. 26.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Technically, a Jew may not desecrate Shabbat to save a non-Jew, since
        one may only desecrate Shabbat for the sake of someone who is himself
        commanded to keep Shabbat. However, in practice, this rule only applies
        when another non-Jew is present to save his fellow non-Jew. If no other
        non-Jew is present, one must treat the non-Jew, even if this requires
        desecrating Shabbat. Since we want non-Jews to save Jews, we must save
        them as well. Thus, saving a non-Jew’s life is included in the category
        of <em>piku’aĥ nefesh</em>.

        4. Using a Non-Jew or Child to Minimize Shabbat Desecration
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen (above, 25:1), a Jew who performs <em>melakha</em> on
Shabbat violates Torah law, whereas a Jew who asks a non-Jew to perform        <em>melakha</em> for him violates rabbinic law. Similarly, a minor who
        performs <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat only transgresses rabbinically
        (above, 24:1). Consequently, it would seem, at first glance, that when
        it is necessary to do <em>melakha</em> in order to save a sick person,
        it is preferable to ask a non-Jew or a child to do it, thereby
        minimizing Shabbat desecration. However, the Sages stated: "These
        things should not be done by non-Jews or children, but rather by adult
        Jews" (<em>Yoma</em> 84b; SA 328:12). This means that even if a non-Jew
or a child is present, one should not ask him to do the        <em>melakha</em>. Only an adult Jew should do it. Rishonim offer two
        possible explanations for this rule. First, it is possible that a
        non-Jew or a child will hesitate and not act aggressively enough to
        help the sick person (<em>Tosafot</em>). Second, even when it is clear
        that they will act aggressively enough, we are concerned that those
        present might incorrectly conclude that an adult Jew may not desecrate
        Shabbat in order to help someone who is dangerously ill. Then, if faced
        with a similar situation sometime in the future, they might delay
        helping in order to look for a non-Jew or a child. In the meantime, the
        sick person might die (Ran).
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the Rishonim write that if many people are available to help
        the sick person, it is a mitzva for the most respected person present
        to do so, thus making it clear to everyone that saving a life overrides
Shabbat and that there is no need to seek ways to minimize the        <em>melakha</em> (Ri’az; Tashbetz; MB 328:34).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the situation is less pressured, and it is easy to find a non-Jew or
        a child to do the necessary <em>melakhot</em>, and doing so will not
        cause any delay, then even though <em>le-khatĥila</em> an adult Jew may
        do whatever <em>melakha </em>is necessary to save a life, it is optimal
        greater enhancement to minimize Shabbat desecration by having a non-Jew
        or a child perform the <em>melakhot</em> (SSK 38:2). However, if there
        is even the slightest, tiniest shadow of a doubt that using a non-Jew
        or a child will delay the provision of lifesaving treatment, either now
or in the future, it is better for an adult Jew to do the        <em>melakha</em>.

        5. Using a <em>Shinui</em> to Minimize Shabbat Desecration
    </h2>
    <p>
        When dealing with saving lives on Shabbat, a serious dilemma arises. On
        the one hand, it would seem to be preferable to use a <em>shinui</em>
when doing whatever <em>melakhot</em> are necessary. After all, when a        <em>melakha</em> is done in the normal way, one violates Torah law,
        while when it is done with a <em>shinui</em>, one transgresses only
        rabbinically (above 9:3). On the other hand, when it comes to saving a
        life on Shabbat, the Sages proclaimed that "One who acts quickly is to
        be praised" (<em>Yoma</em> 84b; SA 328:2). If so, it would seem
        preferable to refrain from placing constraints upon one who is
        attempting to save a life. Rather, he should act as he would on a
        weekday, as efforts such as minimizing Shabbat desecration or
        attempting to do the <em>melakhot</em><em> </em>with a <em>shinui </em>
        are likely to slow him down. This is especially true if he thinks it is
        necessary to consult with a rabbi about how to act when a person’s life
        is in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, the basic principle is that rescue efforts must be
undertaken in the best and fastest way possible. If trying to do        <em>melakhot</em> with a <em>shinui</em> is likely to delay treatment,
it is preferable to do them in the normal fashion, without any        <em>shinui</em>. This is because according to <em>halakha</em>, the
        rescuer may do <em>melakhot</em> in the normal way, since saving a life
overrides Shabbat. Nevertheless, when it is clear that a<em>shinui</em> will not hamper the rescue in any way, it is preferable        <em>le-khatĥila</em> to make use of a <em>shinui</em>. Therefore, it is
        advisable for doctors, nurses, and emergency medical workers to learn
        how to minimize Shabbat desecration while saving a person’s life.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a similar dilemma regarding treatments normally administered
        to a gravely ill patient during the week, some of which are not
        necessary to prevent his death. Since the caregivers do not know which
        treatments are truly necessary and which are not, they must treat the
        patient just as they would treat him during the week. However, one who
understands medicine and knows for certain that a specific        <em>melakha</em> is not necessary to save the patient, or that the
        treatment can be postponed until after Shabbat, he should avoid doing
        the <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat (SA 328:4). Palliative treatments are
        administered on Shabbat even when it is clear that they do not treat
        the disease, because when the patient’s pain is reduced, he will have
        more strength to overcome his illness.

    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. Traveling to the Hospital
    </h2>
    <p>
        When rushing a patient to the hospital, one drives normally, as he
would during the week. He should not try to drive with a        <em>shinui</em>,<em> </em>as this may cause delay or be dangerous. One
        may travel to the hospital in a private vehicle or call an ambulance.
        All items necessary for the patient or woman in labor - vital
        medications, medical documents, and proper identification - may be
carried from the house to the car, even in an area without an        <em>eruv</em>. Even items that are not vital to saving lives but are
        important to the patient or his chaperone - including changes of
        clothing, food, and books - may be taken to the hospital. If there is
        no <em>eruv</em>, such items should be carried with a <em>shinui</em>.
        In addition, the person carrying them should walk directly from the
        house to the car without stopping, so that the act of carrying will
        qualify as a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, which is permitted in a case of
        great necessity. <em>Muktzeh</em> items may not be brought, but if they
        were packed in the hospital bag together with necessary items, one may
        bring the bag. <em>Muktzeh</em> items that will be greatly needed after
        Shabbat - such as money and a cellphone - may be placed in the bag on
        Shabbat using a <em>shinui</em> and brought to the hospital along with
        the bag.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        After arriving at the hospital and parking in a place that does not
        interfere with the arrival of other vehicles, it is, at first glance,
        forbidden to turn off the car. After all, thus far all travel was for
        the patient’s sake; in contrast, one turns off the car for the sake of
        the car itself - to lock it and to make sure that the batteries do not
        die. Therefore, when possible, one should ask a non-Jew to turn off the
        car’s motor and headlights and then to lock the car.
    </p>
    <p>
        If no non-Jew is available, or if searching for one is likely to delay
        attending to the patient, one may turn off the car and headlights with
        a <em>shinui</em>, so that the prohibition is only rabbinic. For
        example, he may grasp the key or press the button that operates the
        headlights with the back of his fingers. He should also lock the car
        with a <em>shinui</em>, for example, by pushing the remote control with
        the back of his fingers. Then, even though the headlights will go on as
        a result, it will have been done with a <em>shinui</em>. The reason all
        this is permitted is that the Sages allowed one to take such steps at
        the end of a rescue effort to ensure that people are willing to do what
        needs to be done at the beginning. After all, if a driver knows that he
        will not be able to turn off and lock his car upon arrival at the
        hospital, the next time he might avoid taking the patient to the
        hospital altogether. Therefore, the Sages permitted transgressing any
        rabbinic prohibitions to make it easier for those individuals helping
        to save lives.

        7. Choosing a Hospital and Doctor
    </h2>
    <p>
        When one must drive a gravely ill person or a woman in labor to the
        hospital, he should drive to the nearest hospital, in order to avoid
        additional Shabbat desecration. Even if there are better hospitals
        available, for routine matters, like births and treatment of injuries
        and common diseases, there is no significant difference between
        hospitals, so one drives to the closest one. Even if the patient or
        woman in labor prefers a more distant hospital because it is cheaper,
        has nicer rooms, or is more conveniently located for relatives who will
        wish to visit, since these are not medical considerations, one may not
        drive farther on Shabbat for any of these reasons. Similarly, if a
        woman is away from home for Shabbat and goes into labor, she should go
        to a local hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a case is more complicated and there is a medical reason to prefer
        a more distant hospital, one may drive there on Shabbat. For example,
        if the more distant hospital specializes in the treatment of the
        patient’s illness, or if the illness is complex, and the more distant
        hospital is already familiar with the patient and will therefore be
        able to provide the appropriate treatment more quickly, one may drive
        the patient there. So too, if a woman’s pregnancy is considered
        high-risk, and the distant hospital has a protocol in place for her
        needs, one may drive her there on Shabbat. Everything should be done in
        accordance with accepted medical recommendations. The more complicated
        and difficult the case, the farther one may travel to ensure the best
        care. Thus, if there is only a slight medical advantage, one may travel
        only slightly farther to gain that advantage. After all, during the
        week, sick people and women in labor are not advised to travel long
        distances to the best hospitals for every minor medical issue. So too
        on Shabbat, they may not travel farther to reach the best hospitals,
        since accepted medical recommendations do not demand it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a woman in labor claims that she will receive better medical care at
        a more distant hospital, even if her claim has no realistic basis, one
        may drive a bit farther in order to ease her mind, but not a lot
        farther. Even when one may extend the drive for a medical reason, it
        must remain within reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, it is preferable to go to a hospital that operates in
        accordance with <em>halakha</em>. On Shabbat, one may travel slightly
        farther in order to reach such a hospital. This way there will be less
        Shabbat desecration in the hospital, and the patient will feel more
        comfortable. However, one should not travel much farther for this
        purpose.

        8. Accompanying a Sick Person or Woman in Labor to the Hospital
    </h2>
    <p>
        A patient who is rushed to the hospital generally needs a chaperone, to
        offer support and to ensure that he is given proper care by the medical
        staff. Unfortunately, due to heavy volume of patients at a hospital,
        patients who are alone are sometimes overlooked. Therefore, if a family
        finds out that a relative has been hospitalized with a serious injury
        or illness and is alone in the hospital, one of the family members must
        travel there, even on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, a woman in labor must be accompanied to the hospital. Even
        if she does not request, someone - her husband, mother, or doula -
        should travel with her. If the woman in labor or the patient arrives at
        the hospital without a chaperone, it is permitted to call someone to
        travel to the hospital. Even though caring for a woman in labor is
        straightforward and familiar, there is still a concern that she will
        panic and endanger herself. Therefore, one may desecrate Shabbat on her
        behalf and do whatever he may do for a dangerously sick person (SA
        330:1; MB <em>ad loc. </em>3; BHL s.v. "u-madlikin").
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, some women request the presence of both their husbands and
        their mothers at the hospital. Some also ask their doulas to attend.
        Since this is not a lifesaving medical necessity, only one chaperone
        may travel along - her husband, her mother, or her doula. Only in an
        unusual circumstance, such as when a woman becomes hysterical and
        insists that both her husband and her mother must accompany her, may
        they both do so. Similarly, if she experiences anxiety and demands that
        they call her doula, the doula may be called. Nevertheless, one may not
        plan for more than one person to accompany her on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others disagree and maintain that one should do whatever the woman in
        labor wants, even if she is not hysterical. If she wants her husband,
        mother, and doula to come with her, they all travel along, to put her
        mind at ease. According to this approach, one may even make a detour in
        order to pick them up or call them to request that they make their own
        way to the hospital. However, this would seem to be excessive, and it
        does not legitimize driving on Shabbat. The widespread custom is that
        one person accompanies a woman in labor. However, if the drive is long
        and the husband is driving, the mother or doula may come along as well,
        since sometimes another person is needed to help the woman during the
        drive.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the woman in labor has small children at home, one must prearrange
        for neighbors to care for the children in the event that the parents
        must travel on Shabbat. However, if they live in a remote location, or
        if the neighbors are bad or untrustworthy people, with whom it is
        dangerous to leave children, and leaving the children home alone would
        also be dangerous, the children may travel with the parents to the
        hospital. One may also make a slight detour in order to drop them off
        with a family that can take care of them.

        9. Driving Home on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the patient is released after it is determined that he is not in
        danger, he and his chaperones may not desecrate Shabbat to return home.
        If necessary - for example, if the patient needs rest - he may be
        transported home by a non-Jewish driver. However, the chaperone may not
        ride along unless the patient needs help en route (see below, 28:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if a woman is rushed to the hospital to give birth and then
        released after an examination reveals that she is not yet ready to give
        birth, she may not desecrate Shabbat to return home. In a time of need,
        if she is still considered sick - for example, if she needs to lie down
        - she may be driven home by a non-Jew, but her chaperone may not ride
        along.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Jewish ambulance driver from an outlying community, which needs an
        ambulance for emergencies, may return to his community after
        transporting a patient to the hospital. However, he may not drive home
        the patient or his chaperone, as transporting them entails
        transgressing Torah prohibitions, since their added weight causes the
        engine to burn more fuel. Even if the prohibition were merely rabbinic,
        it would still be forbidden for them to ride home with a Jewish driver.
        <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a Jewish ambulance driver in a city drives to treat a patient, he
        may not drive back to the EMT station afterwards on Shabbat. Since
        ambulances contain two-way radios, the driver can be contacted at his
        present location if he is needed for another emergency. However, if
        there is a real need to drive back - for example, if he expects that he
        will need an additional medic or more medical equipment for his next
        trip, or if resting at the station will enable him to treat people more
        effectively later - he may return to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an ambulance was summoned to treat someone in grave danger, but
        before the ambulance arrives another way to rush him to the hospital
        was found, someone must call and cancel the request for an ambulance,
        as it may be needed for a patient elsewhere while it continues to a
        destination where it is no longer needed. Additionally, there is a
        concern that medical personnel will not take things seriously when they
        are alerted on Shabbat in the future, thinking that their help might no
        longer be necessary but that no one has notified them because they do
        not want to make a phone call on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a Jewish driver is transporting a woman in labor to the hospital,
        and during the drive she says that her contractions have stopped (to
        the point that, if she were at home, she would not consider going to
        the hospital), he may not continue driving. He must stop and park in a
        safe place until Shabbat is over (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach). If the
ambulance must be returned to the station for reasons of        <em>piku’aĥ nefesh</em>, the driver returns to the station, and the
        woman and her chaperone may remain in the ambulance and return with
        him.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Jewish doctor who is summoned to treat a gravely ill patient may
        drive to the patient without ascertaining the details, since even the
        possibility of saving a life overrides Shabbat. Nevertheless, it is
        preferable that he call to clarify the patient’s state, since it is
        possible that the clarification will lead the doctor to decide that the
        trip is unnecessary, and it is preferable to minimize the Shabbat
        desecration. Even when it is clear that the patient is gravely ill and
        requires the doctor, the phone conversation is still useful. First, it
        is possible that the doctor will be able to give specific instructions
        for how to care for the patient until he arrives. Additionally, it may
        become clear to the doctor that he needs to bring additional equipment
        with him.

        10. Doctors and Nurses Driving to Work and Back Home on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a doctor has a shift on Shabbat morning and lives too far away from
        the hospital to reach it on foot, he must drive to the hospital before
        Shabbat so he will not have to desecrate Shabbat. <em>Be-di’avad</em>,
        if he did not drive to the hospital beforehand, he may drive there on
        Shabbat, since saving a life overrides Shabbat. Nevertheless, if he
        knows before Shabbat that he will have a shift on Shabbat, he must
arrange to spend Shabbat in the hospital or nearby (        <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 1:131).
    </p>
    <p>
        The best solution for doctors and nurses in such a situation is to hire
        a non-Jewish driver to drive them from their homes to the hospital.
        This way, these doctors and nurses can enjoy Shabbat in their homes,
        and then when they need to go to the hospital, they can get there with
the help of a non-Jew. Even though the Sages prohibited benefiting from        <em>melakha</em> performed by a non-Jew on Shabbat (above, 25:1), they
        permitted this for the sake of a sick person.
        <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Doctors and nurses who finish their shifts on Shabbat morning may
        return home with the help of a non-Jewish driver. The Sages ruled that
        those involved with saving lives on Shabbat may transgress rabbinic
        prohibitions in order to return home, so that they will not be tempted
        in the future to refuse to go in the first place. If they are forced to
        stay in the hospital until after Shabbat, it will be very upsetting for
        them and their families, and we are concerned that as a result they
        will quit their jobs or avoid working shifts on Shabbat.

        11. Scheduling Surgeries and Circumcisions on the Days Preceding
        Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, one may need to schedule a surgical procedure that will then
require follow-up care involving the performance of various        <em>melakhot</em>. Similarly, some procedures, such as the extraction
        of a wisdom tooth, cause pain for several days, which may impair one’s
ability to enjoy Shabbat. If the surgery is not urgent, it is proper        <em>le-khatĥila</em> to schedule it for the first three days of the
        week. However, if the best surgeon is only available during the second
        half of the week, the operation may be scheduled for then, even if it
        is possible to get an appointment at the beginning of the week with a
        less expert surgeon (see above, 2:10-11).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a woman is due to give birth and her doctors decide that labor
        should be induced, it may be done on Friday, even though it is
        reasonable to assume that this will cause her to give birth on Shabbat
        (SSK 32:33 and the notes).
    </p>
    <p>
        If an operation is urgent, it should not be postponed, even if it is
        possible to postpone it until the beginning of the week. This is
        because sometimes problems arise, and the surgery may be delayed beyond
        the time that is medically desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
If a baby boy was sick and his circumcision was delayed,        <em>poskim</em> disagree whether the circumcision may be held on a
        Thursday or Friday. Some argue that since it has already been postponed
        beyond the Torah-mandated eighth day, the baby should not be
        circumcised on Thursday or Friday, because in the days following the
        circumcision he might require care that would involve Shabbat
desecration. This is the custom in many Sephardic communities (<em>Tashbetz</em> 1:21; <em>Rav Pe’alim</em>, YD 4:28;        <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, YD 5:23). Others maintain that the likelihood of
        needing to desecrate Shabbat following the circumcision is not high,
        and since there is a mitzva to perform the circumcision as soon as
        possible, one should do so even on Thursday or Friday (<em>Shakh</em>,
        YD 266:18; MA 331:9). This is the widespread custom among Ashkenazic
        and Yemenite Jews, as well as some Sephardim.

        12. Fighting Wars on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a mitzva to wage a defensive war against Israel’s enemies. This
        mitzva is even greater than the mitzva of saving human life, as one is
        not required to risk his own life in order to save the life of another,
        or even multiple lives. In contrast, it is a mitzva - incumbent upon
        every individual - to risk one’s life to save the Jewish people from
        their enemies (<em>Mishpat Kohen</em> §143; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
        13:100; see <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Collected Essays II</em>
        11:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if enemies attack Israel, it is a mitzva to wage war against
        them even if this will endanger lives and require Shabbat desecration.
        Indeed, Rambam rules: "There is a mitzva incumbent upon all capable
        Jews to come to the aid of their brothers who are under siege, and to
        save them from non-Jews on Shabbat; they may not delay until after
        Shabbat…" (MT 2:23). Similarly, if it is known that enemies or
        terrorists are planning to attack Jews, it is a mitzva to attack them
        in order to deter them. If there is a strategic objective served by
attacking them on Shabbat, we attack on Shabbat (        <em>Heikhal Yitzĥak</em>, OĤ 37:3; <em>Amud Ha-yemini</em> §16; see
        Rema 329:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, it is also a mitzva to wage war to prevent future danger,
        even though doing so will put lives at risk and require Shabbat
        desecration. This is in accordance with the statement of the Sages that
        if enemies come to pillage border towns, even if they are taking only
        straw and hay, "we attack them with weapons and desecrate Shabbat on
        their account" (<em>Eruvin</em> 45a). We do this because if our enemies
        know that they can steal without repercussions, they will ultimately
end up attacking people. This is also the ruling of        <em>Shulĥan Arukh</em> (329:6). Accordingly, it is a mitzva to perform
        ongoing security operations on Shabbat, to protect our borders from our
        enemies. Nowadays, the entire country of Israel has the status of
        border towns with respect to preventing terror attacks (R. Shlomo
        Goren). Therefore, throughout Israel, it is a mitzva to perform ongoing
        security operations on Shabbat, to protect life and property.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Jews who do not observe Shabbat go on a hike on Shabbat in an area
        where it is necessary to travel with an armed escort, and there is no
        way to prevent them from hiking in the first place, it is a mitzva for
        soldiers to protect them, even if this entails Shabbat desecration.
        Even though it is the hikers’ Shabbat desecration that creates the need
        for security, nevertheless, since they are in fact in a dangerous
place, they must be protected from the enemy (R. Goren,        <em>Meshiv Milĥama</em> 1:7 and 2:110; see <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em>
        ch. 21). However, soldiers may not help them desecrate Shabbat. Thus,
        soldiers may not open checkpoints for them so that they can pass
        through, give them travel permits, or board their bus to enable them to
        set out. Only after the group is already underway may soldiers provide
        security for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bodies of fallen soldiers may be retrieved from the battlefield on
        Shabbat to ensure that they do not fall into enemy hands. Even though
        technically one may not desecrate Shabbat in order to save corpses,
        since abandoning bodies harms the morale of soldiers, and since Israeli
        society is willing to free terrorists in order to retrieve bodies
        captured by the enemy, retrieving them from the battlefield prevents
        danger to life. After the bodies are recovered, one may not desecrate
        Shabbat any further to care for the bodies (<em>Meshiv Milĥama</em>
        vol. 1, p. 61 and 2:117; <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> ch. 20).
    </p>
    <p>
The war to conquer the Eretz Yisrael is considered a        <em>milĥemet mitzva</em> (obligatory war). Accordingly, when there is a
        tactical advantage, one may initiate an attack even on Shabbat, as our
        ancestors did in the days of Yehoshua when they conquered Yeriĥo on
        Shabbat (<em>y.</em> <em>Shabbat</em> 1:8; <em>Tur</em>, OĤ 249:1).

        13. A Commanding Officer’s Authority During Wartime and Normal Times
    </h2>
    <p>
        During a war, one must do everything possible for the sake of victory,
        on Shabbat as well. One may not delay matters by referring questions to
        rabbis, nor should he bother commanding officers by asking them what is
        or is not necessary. Rather, anything required must be done as quickly
        as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, in normal times, when routine and ongoing security
        operations and intelligence-gathering are being carried out, Shabbat
        desecration should be minimized. Only activities meant to prevent
        life-threatening situations should be undertaken. When possible, it is
        preferable to use a <em>shinui</em> or another method that renders
        these actions prohibited on the rabbinic level only. To that end, the
        military rabbinate of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) must establish
        special Shabbat procedures that enable each soldier to carry out his
        security operations while minimizing Shabbat desecration. Normally, one
        may not conduct training exercises on Shabbat. Only when forces are on
        high alert and there is a security need may soldiers be trained for an
        upcoming operation in which they will participate.
        <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        When things function properly, one may rely on a commanding officer’s
        familiarity with both security needs and <em>halakha</em>, in
        accordance with the directives of the military rabbinate. Then, if he
        gives an order that entails Shabbat desecration, the implication is
        that it is necessary for security needs and must be obeyed. However,
        when there is reason to distrust the officer - whether because he does
        not take the rabbinate’s directives seriously, because the rabbinate is
        not fulfilling its responsibilities, or because the order is illogical
        - the soldier must clarify with his commanding officer whether the
        action requested is necessary for security. If, despite what the
        officer says, it is clear to the soldier that the order involves
        Shabbat desecration that is not necessary to maintain security, he may
        not obey the order, as one may not desecrate Shabbat except to save a
        life. If the soldier is uncertain, he must follow the order, because
        even the possibility of saving a life overrides Shabbat. However, after
        Shabbat he must clarify with the army rabbinate, and if necessary with
        his own rabbis, whether the order was legitimate or not. If it was not,
        he must file a complaint against his commanding officer and object to
        his actions, using all avenues available to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary way to determine if the purpose of an army operation is
        connected to <em>piku’aĥ nefesh</em> is to see how the army actually
        relates to the operation. If all week long it is taken seriously and
        viewed as indispensable to security, and it is carried out even if it
        involves missing rest time or canceling an entertainment program, then
        it may be done on Shabbat. However, if all week long it is not taken
        seriously, and the operation is sometimes canceled for the sake of
        convenience, then there is no license to desecrate Shabbat in order to
        do it.

        14. Common Army Questions
    </h2>
    <p>
        Soldiers who are patrolling in a vehicle on Shabbat may not deviate
        from the established route in order to eat in a more convenient outpost
        or to meet up with friends, because driving is permitted to them only
        for the sake of security. However, if there is no specific patrol
        route, the soldiers may plan the route to suit their convenience. If
        they have a half-hour break to eat and rest, they may plan for that
        break to be at a place of their convenience. If they are expected to
        patrol inside settlements to make the army presence felt and to deter
        terrorists, they may park near a synagogue or somewhere convenient for
        eating.
        <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Soldiers who know that they will be commencing a military operation on
        Shabbat must spend Shabbat on their base, since if they travel home
        before Shabbat, they would have to desecrate Shabbat to return to the
        base (see MB 344:11). Even if the commanding officer is married and
        will greatly upset his family members by remaining on base, if the
        operation will definitely take place on Shabbat, he may not go home,
        since that would force him to travel back on Shabbat. However, if there
        is a chance that the operation will be canceled, he may go home for
        Shabbat. As long as it is not certain that the operation will be
executed on Shabbat, he may try to preserve his and his family’s        <em>oneg Shabbat</em>. The officer should be sure to explain to his
        family that since it is uncertain whether or not he will be called, he
        may remain at home. This way they will not belittle Shabbat observance.
        If he finds out on Shabbat that the operation is taking place, he may
        drive to the base. If it can be arranged for a non-Jew to drive him to
        the base on Shabbat, then even if he is certain that the operation will
        take place on Shabbat, he may go home for Shabbat and then have the
        non-Jew drive him to the base. After the operation, if a non-Jew is
        available to drive him home, he may travel with him. If no non-Jewish
        driver is available, he may not return home.

    </p>
    <p>
        If soldiers are summoned to deal with an incident, but before they
        arrive it becomes clear that they are not needed, they should be called
        and told not to come, in order to minimize Shabbat desecration. An
        additional justification for this is that if it later becomes clear to
        soldiers that they were not informed of the cancelation because people
        did not want to use the phone on Shabbat, there is a concern that if
        they are summoned again on Shabbat, they will hesitate to come (see
        above, n. 10).
    </p>
    <p>
        If an observant soldier is assigned guard duty or patrol duty on
        Shabbat, it is good if he swaps his Shabbat assignment with a
        non-observant soldier’s weekday assignment as long as the non-observant
        soldier is willing and there is no concern that switching the
        assignments will cause the guard duty to be taken lightly. Thus, the
        observant soldier will be able to pray and enjoy Shabbat, and the
        non-observant soldier will accrue merit for enabling this.
        Additionally, while the non-observant soldier is guarding, he is doing
        a mitzva and not desecrating Shabbat. Nevertheless, the observant
        soldier need not initiate such a swap, because defending the country is
        a mitzva, and there is no need to seek ways to get out of it on Shabbat
        (see <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> ch. 27).

        15. What Must One Give Up to Minimize Shabbat Desecration?
    </h2>
    <p>
        One need not forgo his Shabbat rest or anything else that is dear to
        him in order to minimize the Shabbat desecration of another person who
        is involved in lifesaving activities. In addition, there is a concern
        that if one is forced to forgo something dear to him, he will hesitate
        to do what is needed to remove a hazard. For example, if one sees
        fallen electrical wires that are exposed and deadly, he could
        theoretically stand there for all of Shabbat in order to warn passersby
        not to touch the wires. Nevertheless, if this is difficult for him -
        e.g., if Shabbat will not be over for hours - he may alert the electric
        company, which will send repairmen to fix the wires on Shabbat (R.
        Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, cited in SSK 41:21; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
        8:15:11:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a gravely ill person’s home is so cold that it endangers his life, a
        neighbor whose home is heated need not be asked to inconvenience
        himself by taking in the sick person. Rather, the heat may be turned on
        in the sick person’s home, as saving a life overrides Shabbat. Even if
        the neighbor is asked to take in the sick person, he is not required to
        do so (based on the ruling of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in SSK ch. 32
        n. 174; he derives this from the rule that one need not forgo his
        property and may confront a burglar even if the results may be lethal).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, a soldier on guard duty need not volunteer to do an extra
        shift in order to prevent his replacement from traveling on Shabbat.
        Since one may travel on Shabbat in order to perform guard duty, the
        first guard does not have to forfeit his rest in order to prevent this
        travel.
    </p>
    <p>
        If soldiers need to travel in tanks for a security mission but will
        destroy the <em>eruv</em> if they take the shortest possible route,
they should take a longer route, unless all of the <em>eruv</em>’s        <em> </em>beneficiaries agree to let it be destroyed. This is because
        the <em>eruv</em>’s<em> </em>beneficiaries do not have to forfeit their
        benefit just so that the tank driver can minimize driving on Shabbat.
        Similarly, one who is driving a patient to the hospital should not
        barrel through private or public gardens, even when that is the
        shortest route to the hospital. Rather, the driver must go around,
        because neither the individual nor the community is obligated to
        forfeit its gardens so that someone involved in life-saving travel can
        minimize his Shabbat desecration (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, as cited
        in <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 26:4-7; see there for the dissenting
        opinion as well).

        16. Police Activity on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        All agree that police officers must desecrate Shabbat to save lives.
        Thus, if a suspicious object is found, or if dangerous people are seen
        engaging in suspicious activities, one must call the police. If a
        serious fight breaks out that could turn lethal, one must call the
        police. If robbers break into a home and might harm the residents, one
        must call the police. However, according to some <em>poskim</em>, in a
        situation where there is no danger to life, a police officer may not
        perform <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited by Torah law. For
        example, if thieves robbed a home and left, since there is no longer
        any danger to human life, one may not call the police. Even if the
        thieves are still in the home, but the residents are not home, since
        there is no danger to life, one may not call the police. Similarly, if
        one witnesses thieves breaking into a closed store or bank, one may not
        call the police. In addition, a police officer may not write up reports
        about a theft, fingerprint an apprehended thief, or transport a thief
        to the police station on Shabbat (SSK 41:24-25; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
        329:20-27).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, several leading rabbinic authorities maintain that one may
        call the police in order to prevent theft or property damage, and a
        police officer may respond by driving to the scene of the crime,
        because if property damage or theft is not dealt with on Shabbat, the
        crime rate will skyrocket, and ultimately people’s lives will be
        endangered. Within this opinion, there is debate about whether police
        officers may drive back to the station after an incident and whether
        they may perform regular patrols on Shabbat. Some are inclined to
        permit this when the drivers are not Jewish (<em>Heikhal Yitzĥak</em>,
        OĤ 32; <em>Yaskil Avdi</em>, OĤ 5:44; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 4:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        Our master and teacher R. Shaul Yisraeli (<em>Amud Ha-yemini</em> §17)
        allows Jewish police officers to drive on patrol, to drive back to the
        station after an incident, and to transport suspects. He argues that if
        we go easy on criminals or make it difficult for the police to do their
        jobs on Shabbat, police officers might quit or become hesitant in doing
        their jobs, and the crime rate will rise to the point that lives are
        endangered. Therefore, we may do whatever is necessary to prevent
        criminal activity on Shabbat. Furthermore, as we have seen, the Sages
        allow those involved with saving lives to return home, even though they
        will be carrying their weapons through a public domain. If we do not
        let them return, they might hesitate to go out to help people in the
        future (above, section 10).
    </p>
    <p>
        Another factor supports this approach. As we have seen, the Sages
        stated that if a gravely ill person needs someone to take care of him,
        then even if a non-Jew is available, it is preferable for a Jew to
        undertake whatever <em>melakhot</em> are necessary to help him. If a
        non-Jew is asked to take care of him, it may happen that if someone is
        dangerously ill in the future and no non-Jew is available, people will
        be hesitant to desecrate Shabbat in order to help him (above, section
        4). The same logic applies regarding police activity. If we restrict
        the ability of the police to catch thieves and prevent crime on
        Shabbat, ultimately this will lead to loss of life. We should add that
        nowadays some criminal activity in Israel is connected with terrorist
        activity. Therefore, the struggle against thieves is, to a large
        extent, also a struggle against terrorists, and thus directly involves
        saving lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to all opinions, one may not call the police on Shabbat in
        order to fill out reports that are strictly financial, such as for the
        purpose of making an insurance claim or the like. Additionally, one may
        not call the police on Friday night to complain about noisy neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The police force should commission rabbis to review the entire array of
        police operations and determine, together with the police chiefs, what
        is vital and must be done on Shabbat and what is not. Similarly, they
        should establish special Shabbat protocols to minimize Shabbat
        desecration; for example, the officers can use a <em>shinui</em>
        whenever possible. They should also establish a procedure ensuring that
        if a non-Jewish police officer is on duty, he will be the one to drive
        and to write reports. All Jewish police officers should also be
        provided with a Shabbat pen, so that their writing will only be
        rabbinically prohibited (above, 18:2; see <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>

        17. Mobile Phones and Weapons Necessary for Health and Security
    </h2>
    <p>
        In an area enclosed by an <em>eruv</em>, emergency medical
        professionals and volunteers who always carry beepers or cell phones
        may carry these devices on Shabbat. Similarly, one who always carries a
        pistol or rifle may carry it on Shabbat. <em>Muktzeh</em> is not an
issue, because many maintain that a pistol is a        <em>kli she-melakhto le-heter</em>, since its purpose is defense and
        deterrence. Similarly, since a two-way radio is designed to help save
        lives, it is also a <em>kli she-melakhto le-heter</em>. A cell phone is
used primarily for calls that are unrelated to saving lives, so it is a        <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>. Nevertheless, one may carry such an
        object to use it <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em>, and therefore it may be
        carried to save lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in an area without an <em>eruv</em>, one should not carry
        these items. When there are life-saving reasons for people to remain
        close to weapons and communication devices in case of emergency, they
        may carry these items to places where one normally goes on Shabbat,
        such as to prayers and celebrations. If we do not allow this, no one
        will volunteer to undertake security and rescue efforts. In general,
        this consideration is used to permit rabbinic transgressions. Only
        under very pressing circumstances is it permitted for one to transgress
        Torah prohibitions (see above, n. 12). Therefore, one should carry the
        two-way radio with a <em>shinui</em> (for example, under one’s shirt),
        which makes the transgression rabbinic. However, one should carry the
gun normally, because it would be dangerous to carry it with a        <em>shinui</em>. Additionally, some maintain that for security
        personnel, a weapon is not considered something that is carried, but an
        article of clothing that is worn.
        <button type="button" id="1018" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 18</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, one may not carry a gun or a two-way radio on Shabbat for the
        sake of a leisurely stroll to a place with no <em>eruv</em>. Thus, one
        should not take a walk outside the <em>eruv</em> in an area where he
        must be armed for security reasons, as this will require people to
        carry weapons needlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a soldier wants to leave his base in order to participate in prayer
        services taking place in a nearby community, and he will need to pass
        through an area with no <em>eruv</em> to get there, after he leaves the
        base he should rest his gun and two-way radio on a <em>mekom petur</em>
        . He should then carry the items from there to the community. He should
        do this on his way back as well, as explained above in 21:7.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding putting out a dangerous fire, see 16:6-7 above. Regarding
        alarm systems, see 17:15 above.

            Saving a life overrides all <em>mitzvot</em>, with the exception of
            the three cardinal sins: idolatry, murder, and sexual
            transgressions. Concerning these three, the rule is "One should be
            killed and not transgress" (<em>San</em>. 74a; MT, Laws of Torah
            Principles 5:1-2). The punishment that the Torah prescribes for
            Shabbat desecration is stoning, the most severe punishment in the
            Torah and the same punishment specified for idol worship.
Nevertheless, when it comes to lifesaving activities, performing            <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat is not considered a transgression. In
            contrast, the three cardinal sins are considered transgressions no
            matter how dire the situation. This is because if one transgresses
            one of them, his life loses all meaning, and he brings death and
            destruction to the world.

            The basis of this permissive ruling, namely, that it ultimately
            prevents danger to Jews, is articulated in <em>Ĥatam Sofer</em>, YD
131 and <em>Divrei Ĥayim</em>, OĤ 2:25. Similar rulings appear in            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:79; R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, cited in
SSK ch. 40 n. 47; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 8:15:6 and 9:17:1; and<em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 8:38. Additionally, according to Ramban (<em>Hasagot Le-sefer Ha-mitzvot</em>,            <em>Hosafot Le-mitzvot Aseh </em>15), we desecrate Shabbat to save
            a <em>ger toshav</em> (a "resident alien," a non-Jew who has
            accepted the seven Noaĥide laws before a <em>beit din</em>). This
            is also the opinion of Rashbatz. Others maintain that even if a
            non-Jew did not accept the Noahide laws before a <em>beit din</em>,
if he observes these laws in practice, he is considered a            <em>ger toshav</em> (Maharatz Ĥayot; R. Meir Dan Plotzky). This is
also the opinion of R. Naĥum Rabinovitch in            <em>Melumdei Milĥama</em>, p. 143. Many others maintain that we do
            not desecrate Shabbat for a <em>ger toshav</em>, and that this
            category does not even exist nowadays. However, according to all
            opinions, in practice we desecrate Shabbat to save the life of any
            person, as explained above. In a hospital that operates in
            accordance with <em>halakha</em>, it is preferable to have
            non-Jewish doctors and nurses on duty during Shabbat. If non-Jewish
            patients arrive, the non-Jewish medical staff can care for them. If
            a Jewish doctor has the most expertise on an illness afflicting a
            non-Jewish patient, and during the week such a case would normally
            be referred to him, the Jewish doctor treats the non-Jewish
            patient, even if this will involve performing <em>melakhot</em>
            that under normal circumstances are prohibited by Torah law.

            According to Rashba and Ran, Shabbat is superseded (<em>deĥuya</em>
            ) by danger to life; in contrast, according to Maharam of
            Rothenburg, danger to life effectively suspends Shabbat and causes
            all <em>melakha </em>to become completely permitted (<em>hutra</em>
            ). It would seem that according to those who feel that Shabbat is
            simply superseded, Shabbat desecration should be minimized whenever
            possible. Those <em>melakhot</em> that are necessary should be done
            using a <em>shinui</em> or by a non-Jew or minor. In contrast,
            according to those who maintain that Shabbat is suspended,
everything may be done in the normal way and all is permitted            <em>le-khatĥila</em>. In truth, there is little practical
            difference between these approaches, since even according to those
            who maintain that Shabbat is merely superseded, it is still
            preferable for a Jew to engage in lifesaving activity rather than a
            non-Jew (SAH<em> </em>328:13), as stated in <em>Yoma</em> 84b.
            Rishonim there explain that if one asks a non-Jew to help, he might
            not act aggressively enough (<em>Tosafot</em>), or Jews who witness
            this might hesitate and not act aggressively enough in future cases
            (Ran). Therefore, even though Rema writes in 328:12 that it is
            preferable to use a non-Jew, a minor, or a <em>shinui</em>, almost
            all Aĥaronim follow SA’s opinion that it is preferable for a Jew to
be the one to desecrate Shabbat to save a life (<em>Taz</em>;            <em>Eliya Rabba</em>; <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em>; MB <em>ad loc</em>.
            37; SSK 32:6). Nevertheless, when there is no concern about
            hesitation, either in the present or in the future, it is
            preferable to minimize Shabbat desecration and ask a non-Jew to do
            the <em>melakha</em>. After all, when <em>Shabbat</em> 128b
            discusses the case of a woman in labor who is not in a state of
            panic, it states that one should use a <em>shinui</em> if possible,
            in order to minimize Shabbat desecration. SSK 38:2 states this as
well. The order of preference is: a non-Jew, a minor, a Jew using a            <em>shinui</em>, and two Jews working together.

            At first glance, according to those who maintain that Shabbat is
            suspended (<em>hutra</em>) by danger to life, all treatments
            normally administered to the patient are permitted, and there is no
            need to use a <em>shinui</em> or to minimize prohibitions. Indeed,
            this is implied in SA 328:4: "We do everything for him [on Shabbat]
            that we do for him during the week." However, BHL, s.v. "kol"
            states that since the vast majority of Rishonim maintain that
            Shabbat is merely superseded (<em>deĥuya</em>) by danger to life,
            one should not do <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited by Torah
            law unless they are necessary to save a life. Additionally, Rema
writes in 328:12 that when possible, it is proper to employ a            <em>shinui</em> when doing a <em>melakha</em>. Nevertheless, it
            seems that in practice there is almost no disagreement. Even
            according to MB, we must do anything that effectively minimizes the
            patient’s pain or strengthens him, because this can indirectly
            affect his ability to heal (SSK 32:22, 57). On the other hand, when
            it is possible to do the <em>melakha</em> with a <em>shinui</em>
            without causing any delay or hesitation, it is preferable to do so,
            as in the case of a woman in labor (SA 330:1). This is also the
            opinion of <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Tetzaveh 15. Indeed,
            although some maintain that a woman in labor is an exceptional
            case, and that for any other sick person one should not do anything
differently from what would be done during the week (            <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:36:2-3; <em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4,
            Tetzaveh 1:4), it nevertheless seems, as I wrote in the main text,
            that when there is no concern that using a <em>shinui</em> will
            delay treatment, it is preferable to use a <em>shinui</em> and
            minimize Shabbat desecration. This can be seen in <em>Menaĥot</em>
            64a and SA 328:16, which state (in the context of cutting figs for
            the needs of a gravely ill person) that one should minimize Shabbat
            desecration. At the same time, in order to make sure that people
            will not hesitate to take care of sick people, the basic
            instruction is that on Shabbat we do for the sick person
            "everything that we do for him during the week" (SA 328:4). Anyone
who acts accordingly, even if he could have incorporated a            <em>shinui</em>, has acted properly, as saving a life overrides
            Shabbat. In my humble opinion, it seems that all <em>poskim</em>
            would agree with this delineation. Even if those who maintain that
Shabbat is suspended would say that it is unnecessary to use a            <em>shinui</em>, one should <em>le-khatĥila</em> follow the
majority opinion, that Shabbat is superseded, when possible (see            <em>Harĥavot</em>). Hospital administrators should examine their
            Shabbat procedures, including the arrangements for operations,
            tests, changing sheets, and food preparation, in order to minimize
            transgressing as much as possible without harming the standard of
            care. It is also proper to use non-Jews for Shabbat shifts whenever
            possible.

without stopping there is no Torah prohibition according to most            <em>poskim</em>; see 21 n. 3). Under pressing circumstances, if one
            cannot figure out how to incorporate a <em>shinui</em>, one may
            rely upon these authorities. However, <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is
            proper to carry items with a <em>shinui</em>, thus meeting the
            requirements of all the <em>poskim</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many <em>halakha</em> books have lengthy discussions about how to
            drive with a <em>shinui</em>. However, concerning oneself with this
            is likely to make it more difficult to save lives, and sometimes
            could even endanger the driver and passenger. Therefore, the rule
            is that one should drive without a <em>shinui</em>. Only one who
            knows how to incorporate a <em>shinui</em> without endangering
            anyone’s life should do so. <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> (278:4, n. 37)
            presents this approach in the name of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.
            Regarding <em>muktzeh</em> items, see <em>Harĥavot</em>. A soldier
            who is called up on Shabbat may take his <em>tefilin</em> with him,
            because under pressing circumstances we rely on those who maintain
            that <em>tefilin</em> are not <em>muktzeh</em> (above, 23:8).

            24, 28; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 330:8. Whenever a <em>shinui</em> is
            used to turn off a car, it is a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, and is
            permitted in order to prevent loss (above, 9:11). However, when one
            uses a <em>shinui</em> and the headlights are turned on, there is
            only one <em>shvut</em> involved. Nevertheless, it is permitted
            because the Sages allowed desecrating Shabbat at the end of a
            rescue effort in order to ensure that there is no hesitation at the
            beginning. Perhaps there is another possible reason for leniency:
            the act of locking the car, which causes the headlights to turn on,
might be merely rabbinic, as it is a            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> (since one is not interested in

            If the more distant hospital has a medical approach that is more
            compatible with the patient’s or pregnant woman’s outlook (for
            example, a preference for natural childbirth over Caesarean
            sections), one may travel farther to get there. However, since this
            is not a clear advantage, and in most cases this difference in
            outlook does not come into play, one should not travel much farther
            to reach the preferred hospital for this reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to R. Eliezer Waldenberg, if there is no medical reason
            to prefer a more distant doctor, but the patient believes that the
            distant doctor is better, one must listen to the patient and call
            the preferred doctor, even when it involves additional Shabbat
            desecration (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:55-56). As the Yerushalmi
states: "A person does not merit to be healed by just anyone" (            <em>y. Nedarim</em> 4:2). He also infers this from AZ 55a, which
            speaks of suffering resulting from the treatment of a particular
            doctor. Therefore, one must listen to a patient who demands a
            specific doctor. SSK 32:38 states similarly, as does R. Yitzĥak
            Zilberstein (<em>Torat Ha-yoledet</em> 7:2), who adds that if a
            woman in labor feels that the standard of medical care is better in
            the more distant hospital, one may travel there. He cites R.
            Scheinberg (n. 4) as saying that under normal circumstances, one
            should rely on the nearest hospital since we do not allow
            additional Shabbat desecration in order to put the patient’s mind
            at rest unless it is a situation where the Sages tell us that if we
            do not ease his mind, he will be in danger.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, if there is no substantive medical reason to prefer
            the more distant hospital, but nevertheless the patient feels that
            the distant hospital is medically superior, one may travel a little
            farther, but not much farther. The reason for this is that for a
            dangerously sick person, we do everything on Shabbat that we would
            do during the week (Rambam; SA 328:3). However, going beyond this
            is overly indulgent. During the week, medical opinion is that it is
            proper to travel a little farther to ease the mind of a gravely ill
            person or a woman in labor, but that there is no need to travel
            much farther. A possible support for this position appears in
            another area of Shabbat law: during the course of a circumcision,
            one may cut away bits of skin that do not invalidate the
            circumcision, even though cutting them off on Shabbat would
            otherwise be prohibited by Torah law (<em>Shabbat</em> 133b; SA
            331:2). This is because once circumcision overrides Shabbat,
            everything that is part of the circumcision process overrides it as
            well (Rashi). Thus, arguably, once one may travel on Shabbat, one
            may extend the trip a little to get to the hospital that the
            patient thinks is medically superior. However, to extend the trip
            greatly would mean that the patient would no longer view the extra
            travel as an addition to the basic trip but rather a separate trip
            - which may be undertaken only if it may save a life. In contrast,
            if the patient concedes that the more distant hospital is not
            medically superior, but he just has a better feeling about it, the
            trip should not be extended at all. See <em>Torat Ha-yoledet</em>
            ch. 7, end of n. 4. We should add that in the case of a complex
            illness, there can sometimes be a medical advantage if the patient
            is personally acquainted with a member of the medical staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            R. Zilberstein points out that one should not increase travel time
in order to reach a hospital just because it has higher            <em>kashrut </em>standards<em>. </em>However, if the more distant
            hospital will make a point of minimizing Shabbat desecration, it
            may be that it is preferable to travel to it, because of the
            principle (<em>Menaĥot</em> 63b, 72a) that it is better to
transgress one <em>melakha</em> many times than several            <em>melakhot</em> a few times each (<em>Torat Ha-yoledet</em>
            7:3-4). We should add that it also may be that the sick person has
            more confidence in the medical staff at the religious hospital, in
            which case one may travel a little farther to reach it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a woman in labor tells an ambulance driver that she prefers the
            more distant hospital because she feels that it is medically
            superior, but the real reason for her preference is so that her
            family will be able to visit her, the resulting Shabbat desecration
            is her responsibility, since the driver has no way to know that she
            is lying. From his perspective, this may be a case of saving a
            life, on account of which one desecrates Shabbat.

            One may violate Torah prohibitions in order to accompany a sick
            person or a woman in labor, just as one may light a fire for a
woman in labor even when it is not truly necessary (SA 330:1; MB            <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 3; BHL s.v. "u-madlikin"). This is even
            more relevant today, when the generally accepted wisdom is that the
            patient needs someone to accompany him in the hospital in order to
            ensure that he receives proper care (<em>Nishmat Avraham</em>, OĤ
            278:4 with n. 29, and 330:6 citing R. Yehoshua Neuwirth; R. Yoel
            Katan in <em>Assia</em> 9). If a non-Jew is available to drive the
            children to family or friends, one may ask him to do so, even if
            the neighbors can watch the children in a pinch. If it is not
            necessary to take a detour or make an extra trip to pick up the
            mother or the doula, even if the woman in labor is not completely
            hysterical, if she demands that they travel with her even on
            Shabbat, they may be picked up in a pinch. However, one may not
            plan for them to travel with her, because in fact there is no need
            for more than one person to escort her.
        </p>
        <p>
            A woman in labor who wants to rely on the lenient opinion and have
            two people accompany her must be honest with herself regarding how
            much she truly needs the extra person. She should imagine that, for
            example, she went into labor on a Shabbat that her mother or doula
happened to be hosting large numbers of guests for a son’s            <em>aufruf</em>, when traveling to the hospital would mean
            deserting her guests until after Shabbat and missing her son being
            called up to the Torah. If, under such circumstances, the woman in
            labor would still demand that her mother or doula accompany her in
            addition to her husband, and they would still agree to go, this
            indicates that they really do consider their role in her childbirth
            potentially lifesaving, and they may accompany her according to the
            lenient opinion. However, if under such circumstances the woman in
            labor would forgo their presence, it indicates that she does not
            consider their role to be life-saving. Accordingly, even on a
            regular Shabbat, she should suffice with one chaperone. The
            ambulance driver does not count as a chaperone, as he will not stay
in the hospital with the patient or woman in labor (see            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 1:132; <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:36:23; BHL
            330:1, s.v. "u-madlikin"; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 330:9). It is
            proper not to rely on the lenient opinion at all, because adding
            another chaperone has no lifesaving value; the merit of keeping
            Shabbat is more effective.

            As explained in the next section and in n. 12, the Sages’
            permissive ruling that "the end is permitted because of the
            beginning" applies primarily to doctors, nurses, and emergency
            medical volunteers, who often need to travel on Shabbat. If we
            would not make it easy for them to return home, there is a real
            concern that in the future they will avoid setting out in the first
            place. In contrast, the Sages were not lenient for the patients
            themselves and their chaperones because there is no concern that
            they will hesitate to come in the future. After all, a person will
            always be concerned about his own health. Moreover, the incidents
            are infrequent and would not regularly disrupt the patient’s
            Shabbat rest. However, in a time of need a patient may return home
            with a non-Jewish driver because one may instruct a non-Jew to
            perform <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited by Torah law on
            behalf of a sick person, even if there is no danger to life (SA
            328:17; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 47; below, 28:2). However, there are no
            grounds for leniency for a chaperone, as his added weight would
            cause the engine to burn more fuel (<em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 278:4
            and n. 47; 330:9). But if the patient requires a chaperone on the
            trip back, the chaperone may travel with the patient and the
            non-Jewish driver.

            The Talmud states in <em>Eruvin</em> 32b that it is preferable for
            a learned person to transgress a minor prohibition in order to save
            an unlearned person from unknowingly transgressing a severe
            prohibition. This is the ruling of SA 306:14 and MB <em>ad loc</em>
            . 56, which state that one should desecrate Shabbat to save a Jew
            from apostasy. Based on this, when an ambulance was summoned but an
            alternative arrangement was made after the request was issued, one
            should call and cancel the request. Compared to driving on Shabbat,
            which involves multiple violations of <em>Mav’ir</em>, making a
            phone call is a less severe transgression. However, R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach opposes this approach, presenting a strong
            argument: there is no transgression involved in traveling to save
            lives, so calling to cancel does not minimize Shabbat desecration
(cited in <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 32:1, n. 3).            <em>Torat Ha-yoledet</em> ch. 21 n. 2 makes the same point in the
            name of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. Nevertheless, R. Chaim Pinchas
            Scheinberg comments there that even those who are undertaking
lifesaving work should minimize Shabbat desecration, as MB            <em> </em>states in 328:35. It would seem, though, that someone
            must cancel the request for an ambulance for a different reason: to
            potentially save another life. There may be someone elsewhere who
            is gravely ill, and the ambulance will not be available to help him
            if it is making this unnecessary trip. In addition, a false alarm
            is likely to cause the emergency medical workers to hesitate in the
            future, especially if they know that on Shabbat people will not
            call to cancel the request for a doctor or an ambulance.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a Jewish ambulance driver is in the process of driving a woman
            in labor to the hospital and her contractions stop, he may not
continue traveling (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach,            <em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> 1:91:21; <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 330:25 and
            n. 7). However, if he is from an outlying community and must return
            there with the ambulance, he need not stop to drop off the
            passengers before he returns to the station. Doing so would require
            additional violations of <em>Mav’ir </em>with respect to the lights
            and the engine. Since the passengers are already in the vehicle,
            they may return with him.

            In a place where using a non-Jewish driver is not possible, R.
            Shlomo Zalman Auerbach says (in opposition to <em>Igrot Moshe</em>)
            that a doctor may stay at home until he needs to go to the hospital
            for his shift. When the time comes for him to leave, since it is
            for a lifesaving endeavor, he may drive to the hospital. Even
            though it is true as a rule that one should prepare before Shabbat
            to obviate the need for Shabbat desecration, there is no need to
            take the very difficult step of spending all of Shabbat away from
            home, thus harming both his <em>oneg Shabbat</em> and his family
            time. However, R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach emphasizes that one should
            be lenient in this case only if the hospital administration makes
            serious efforts to prevent unnecessary Shabbat desecration.
            Therefore, in his opinion, one should not in fact be lenient in
            this situation nowadays, as it is possible to arrange for a
            non-Jewish driver. With a non-Jewish driver, one may also be
            lenient and travel farther than twelve <em>mil</em>, which some say
            is the <em>teĥum</em> by Torah law (SSK ch. 32 n. 106; ch. 40 n.
            71; see the end of the next note).

            The Mishna in<em> Eruvin</em> 44b states that those who set out on
a rescue mission outside of the <em>teĥum</em> may travel 2,000            <em>amot</em> in any direction, the same as anyone else at their
            destination. <em>Tosafot</em> (s.v. "kol") comment that this is an
            example of the rationale of "the end is permitted because of the
            beginning,"<em> </em>where certain actions at the end of an
            undertaking are permitted in order to ensure that people will be
            willing to do what needs to be done at the beginning. For instance,
            if we do not allow the rescuers 2,000 <em>amot</em> of movement,
            they will hesitate to undertake the rescue mission in the first
            place. Similarly in RH<em> </em>23b, the Talmud states that a
            midwife who traveled beyond the <em>teĥum</em> on Shabbat may then
            travel 2,000 <em>amot</em> as well. This is the ruling of SA 329:9
            and §407. See below, 30:11. Most <em>poskim</em> limit this
rationale to rabbinic transgressions (MA 497:18;            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 11:39), and they do not always permit these
            either (<em>Har Tzvi</em>, OĤ 2:10; <em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> 1:8).
            However, <em>Minĥat Shlomo</em>, <em>Mahadura Tinyana </em>60:11
            permits returning with the help of a non-Jewish driver if it is
            within twelve <em>mil</em>. Some maintain that when necessary, this
            principle overrides even Torah prohibitions, to ensure that people
            will not hesitate before setting out on future lifesaving trips
(see <em>Ĥatam Sofer</em>, OĤ 203; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:80;            <em>Amud Ha-yemini</em> §17). See <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 24
            n. 18; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 20:59-61 and Essay<em> </em>5 at the
            end of the work; SSK 40:81, 83; <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 278:4 and
            n. 47.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, since it is possible to arrange for a non-Jewish
            driver to take doctors and nurses back to their homes, under no
            circumstances should one be lenient and drive home on Shabbat with
            a Jewish driver. If no non-Jewish driver is available, there is no
            concern that in the future they will hesitate to go to the hospital
            in the first place because of this one instance. With a non-Jewish
driver, one may be lenient and drive even beyond twelve            <em>mil</em>, since according to most Rishonim even this distance
            is only a rabbinic prohibition (Rosh and Rashba; see below 30:1).
In addition, when people are inside a vehicle, the road is a            <em>karmelit</em> and the Jewish passenger is not actively doing
            anything, so there is a strong case to say that even those who are
            stringent regarding twelve <em>mil</em> would not maintain that any
            Torah prohibition is involved (see <em>Assia</em> 7, pp. 241-249).

            A <em>milĥemet reshut</em> (discretionary war) should not be
            started on Shabbat, nor on the last three days of the week.
            However, if a war continues until Shabbat, even if it seems as if
            it will not hurt the war effort to stop fighting on Shabbat, we do
            not stop. As the Torah states: "You may cut [trees] down for
            constructing siege works against the city that is waging war on
            you, until it has been reduced" (Devarim 20:20). The Sages tell us:
            "We do not begin a siege against a non-Jewish town in the last
            three days of the week; but if it was begun, we do not stop.
            Shammai used to say that ‘until it has been reduced’ means even on
            Shabbat." A <em>milĥemet reshut</em> is a war that is meant to
            extend the boundaries of Israel and increase its power. Such a war
is undertaken only by a Jewish king and with the consent of the            <em>Sanhedrin</em> (MT, Laws of Kings 5:1-2). It should be noted
            that in the past, when all monarchies would launch discretionary
            wars, the monarchy of Israel had to initiate such wars as well, in
            order to solidify its position. Had it not done so, it would have
            endangered its long-term survival.

In contrast, a war undertaken to conquer Eretz Yisrael is a<em>milĥemet mitzva</em>, as Ramban writes (<em>Hasagot Le-sefer Ha-mitzvot</em>,            <em>Hosafot Le-mitzvot Aseh </em>4). A great many authorities agree
            with him (see <em>Li-netivot Yisrael</em> vol. 1 ch. 23:
            "Le-mitzvot Ha-aretz"). At first glance, it seems Rambam believes
that conquering Eretz Yisrael is not included in the definition of            <em>milĥemet mitzva</em>. However, he too concedes that if an enemy
            attacks, it is a mitzva to mount a defensive war, both because of
            the mitzva to settle the land (<em>Devar Yehoshua</em>, OĤ 2:48),
            and because of the danger to life (<em>Melumdei Milĥama</em> §1).
            See <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em>, pp. 7-10.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <em>Meshiv Milĥama</em> 1:2, R. Goren analyzes the Gemara’s
            dictum, "‘until it has been reduced’ means even on Shabbat." He
            extrapolates that permission to violate Shabbat for war is even
            more sweeping than permission to violate Shabbat to save a life.
Specifically, a <em>milĥemet mitzva</em> completely suspends (<em>hutra</em>) Shabbat, whereas saving a life only supersedes (            <em>doĥeh</em>)<em> </em>Shabbat. When Rambam limits starting a
            siege to the beginning of the week, he is referring to local
            battles, but an all-out war has no Shabbat limitations. It is as if
            Shabbat has been canceled entirely. However, many view the
            legitimacy of fighting on Shabbat as an expanded form of saving a
            life, since the soldiers are engaged in saving many lives. Others,
based on MT 30:13, maintain that even for a            <em>milĥemet mitzva</em>, we do not begin a siege at the end of the
            week. This is the opinion of Radbaz 4:77. <em>Tur</em>, OĤ 249,
            states that it is a <em>milĥemet reshut</em> that we do not start
in the days preceding Shabbat, but we may start a            <em>milĥemet mitzva</em> even on Shabbat itself. The entire
            disagreement is limited to a case in which there is no tactical
            advantage to beginning the war on Shabbat; but if starting the war
            on Shabbat is likely to save lives, then all agree that we may
            start the war on Shabbat. See <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 25:13,
            pp. 250-251.

            See the previous note. In an all-out war, R. Goren maintains that
            Shabbat is suspended. Even according to those who disagree and
            argue that Shabbat is only superseded, we must avoid doing anything
that might prolong the war. As we saw above in sections 4-5, a            <em>shinui</em> should not be used if it may delay victory, either
            now or in the future. In contrast, in normal times, when one can
            wait patiently to undertake an activity, he should minimize Shabbat
            desecration as much as possible. For example, one should begin with
            the least severe prohibition, similar to how a sick person should
eat on Yom Kippur (SA 619:7-8). Rema YD 155:3 and            <em>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 24 extend this principle to
            medical treatments in general. See above in 18:2, where we discuss
            when writing is necessary on Shabbat and how to minimize the
            prohibitions involved. See also <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 16:26
            with n. 51, and 17:8.

            It is difficult to define what level of danger justifies
            desecration of Shabbat, since there are endless dangers. Even
            routine life is full of danger - on the roads, while going for a
            walk, and even while climbing a ladder at home. Even the flu can
            become life-threatening on rare occasions. Nevertheless, we do not
            hospitalize everyone who contracts the flu. The rule is that if
            something is generally considered dangerous, and people take
            serious, directed action to avoid it, it is considered a danger for
            which one desecrates Shabbat. This is the position of R. Isser
            Yehuda Unterman in <em>Shevet Mi-Yehuda</em> 1:19:2, as quoted in
            SSK ch. 32 n. 2. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Eliezer
            Waldenberg (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 9:17:8:22) agree with this
            position. Thus we can generally establish the <em>halakha</em>
based on how people relate to the danger all week. See            <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 16:8, 13, 14, 16-19.

            The Talmud states in <em>Yoma</em> 84b that one may engage in
            actions that are aimed at saving lives even when the actions serve
            a secondary purpose as well. For example, one may use a net to
            retrieve a child who fell into a river, even if some fish will be
            caught as well. Similarly, one may build steps to rescue a child
            from a pit, even if these steps will be useful later on as well.
            This is the ruling of SA 328:13. All this is on condition that no
            additional <em>melakha </em>is done to achieve the secondary
            purpose. Rishonim disagree about whether one may intend to achieve
            the secondary purpose; this is discussed in SHT <em>ad loc</em>.
            17. However, in the case of patrolling soldiers, even if they
            intend to eat at a convenient place, it would seem that all would
            permit this. After all, there is a slight tactical advantage in
doing so, as they will be more refreshed as a result. See            <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 17:6, pp. 172-3.

            See section 10 and n. 11 above regarding a doctor who has a shift
            on Shabbat. It emerges from there that when it is certain that a
            military operation will begin on Shabbat, the officers and soldiers
            must spend Shabbat on the base. According to R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach, they may spend Shabbat at home and then drive to the base
            on Shabbat, but the accepted ruling is to be stringent. Even if one
            could be lenient on a one-time basis, one may not rely on this
            leniency regularly (see section 2 and n. 7 above). Furthermore, R.
            Shlomo Zalman Auerbach himself did not rule this way in practice.
            He only said that one is not obligated to object if someone else is
            lenient (<em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 26:19 and n. 41). Therefore,
            in practice, an officer who knows that he will need to lead an
            operation on Shabbat should remain on base. However, if there is a
            chance that the operation will be canceled, it would seem that a
            career officer may spend Shabbat at home. If he is called up, then
            he travels to the base. We must take into account that if we are
            too stringent and demand that he remains on base, the pressure from
            his family to leave the army will increase. Even though we do not
            use this reasoning to allow him to return home after an operation
            if Torah prohibitions are involved (as explained above in n. 12),
            nevertheless, before the operation, when there is some doubt about
            whether it will be carried out, he may be lenient. See further
            above, 2:10-11. If a non-Jewish driver is available, the officer
            may travel both ways with him just as doctors and nurses do, as
            explained above in section 10 and n. 12.

            R. Goren writes that a gun is a <em>kli she-melakhto le-heter</em>,
            because it is meant to save lives (<em>Meshiv Milĥama</em> 2:61).
            This is also the opinion of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, who
            maintains that guns, beepers, and hand-held computers (containing
medical information that a doctor needs) are not <em>muktzeh</em> (            <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 2:308:16; <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 301:19
            and n. 6). A mobile phone, which is used primarily for everyday
            purposes, is a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> (above, 23:8).
            However, one may carry it to use it <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em>, like
            calling for help if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the Sages in the Mishna (<em>Shabbat</em> 63a), a
            sword and a bow are not considered ornamental, but rather they are
            considered shameful, because in the prophesied future, "no one will
            study war" (Yeshayahu 2:4). Therefore one may not bear them on
            Shabbat. R. Eliezer disagrees, saying they are considered
            ornamental, and one may go out carrying them on Shabbat. SA 301:7
            rules in accordance with the Sages. However, AHS<em> </em>301:7
            makes the innovative claim that soldiers may go with weapons on
            their bodies because the weapon is part of their clothing. R. Goren
            writes that one may rely upon this rationale if there is a great
            need to do so (<em>Meshiv Milĥama</em> 2:61). Therefore, when there
            is a need for some people to have weapons close at hand, but people
            will hesitate to volunteer to bear weapons unless we permit them to
            attend the synagogue and celebrations, it is preferable that they
            bear weapons in their belt as they normally do at all times, so
            that according to AHS, it is completely acceptable. However, if we
            ask people to carry weapons with a <em>shinui</em>, then not only
            is this dangerous, it also entails violating a rabbinic prohibition
            according to all opinions. In contrast, a beeper or cell phone
            should be carried with a <em>shinui</em>, so that it will only be
            rabbinically prohibited. If the <em>melakha </em>in question is
            walking in a <em>karmelit</em> in order to get to a synagogue, this
            would become a <em>shvut di-shvut</em> for the sake of a mitzva.
            Even if it is a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em> by Torah law, we can argue
            that this is a case in which "the end is permitted because of the
            beginning." According to <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:81, it is
            considered dignified to carry a two-way radio, and therefore the
            radio is considered ornamental (see <em>Be-mareh Ha-bazak</em>
            4:45). Nevertheless, since it is commonplace nowadays, carrying a
            two-way radio is no longer a source of pride, but simply a normal
            type of carrying (<em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 301:3 and n. 1).
            Therefore, it is proper to carry it with a <em>shinui</em>.
