Chapter Four: Bedikat Hametz - the Search for <em>Hametz</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. The Time for <em>Bedikat Hametz    
</h2>
<p>
    As we learned in the previous chapter, one who possesses <em>hametz</em> on Pesah transgresses two prohibitions: "no <em>hametz</em> of yours shall be
    seen" (Shemot 13:7), and "there shall be no <em>se'or</em> found in your homes" (<em>ibid</em>. 12:19). In order not to violate these Torah prohibitions,
    one must eliminate all <em>hametz</em> from his possession. According to the Torah, it is possible to dispose of the <em>hametz</em> by nullifying it
    verbally, because when one nullifies the <em>hametz</em> in his possession, it becomes like dust, no longer belonging to him, and consequently, it does not
    cause him to transgress the prohibition of <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, the Sages ruled that we must not rely on this nullification (<em>bitul</em>) alone; rather, one must also physically remove <em>hametz</em>
    from his possession. There are two reasons for this: firstly, they feared that people would nullify <em>hametz</em> insincerely, intending to benefit from
    it after Pesah, and this would result in their transgressing the prohibition of <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>. Secondly, they feared that
    after nullifying the <em>hametz</em>, one might see an enticing piece of pastry and eat it, forgetting that it is Pesah. The Sages therefore ordained that,
    in addition to <em>bitul hametz</em>, one must search out <em>hametz</em> in order to eliminate it from his possession.
</p>
<p>
    At first glance, the appropriate time for <em>bedikat hametz</em> should be just before midday on the day of the fourteenth of Nisan, the deadline for
    removing <em>hametz</em>. However, the Sages ordained that we search for <em>hametz</em> at nightfall of the fourteenth, because during the day people are
    busy with their affairs, and if one waits until the day of the fourteenth to do <em>bedikat hametz</em> he is liable to forget it altogether. Furthermore,
    candlelight is especially effective for checking the cracks and crevices of the house. But during the day, candles do not illuminate well, since sunlight
    prevents the eye from focusing on the weaker light of the candle. Therefore, the Sages instituted <em>bedikat</em> <em>hametz</em> at nightfall of the
    fourteenth, because at night, people are usually at home and candlelight is effective at this time (SA<em> Ha-Rav</em> 431:5).
</p>
<p>
    Since people normally pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>at the beginning of the night, one should do so prior to the <em>bedika</em>, as a more frequent mitzva takes
    precedence. One should then proceed quickly to <em>bedikat hametz</em> (MB 431:8). One who is accustomed to praying with a <em>minyan</em> later in the
    evening should search for <em>hametz</em> at <em>tzeit ha-kokhavim</em> (the appearance of three distinct stars) and then pray at his usual hour.
</p>
<p>
    The obligation to search for <em>hametz</em> rests primarily upon the father. However, if he must return home late on this day, it is better that he
    appoint his wife or another adult family member to search in his stead at the appointed hour, when nighttime arrives. Regarding this mitzva there is no
    difference between men and women, and one should choose as a <em>shali'ah </em>(proxy) a person who can be trusted to carry out the search properly and
    responsibly (see AHS 437:7). If it is difficult to appoint a <em>shali'ah</em>, then <em>be-di'avad </em>one should perform the search himself later in the
    evening, when he gets home.

</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
 2. Activities Rabbinically Forbidden before <em>Bedikat Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages prohibited starting a task or a meal during the half hour before the time of <em>bedikat</em> <em>hametz</em>, out of concern that one might
    become caught up in these activities and forget to search for <em>hametz</em>. It is permitted, however, to snack on fruit or pastry, or to perform light
    work that can be finished quickly.
</p>
<p>
    Once the time for <em>bedikat hametz</em> arrives, it is improper to start any sort of work or eat fruit, even as a quick snack, for it might impede the
    fulfillment of the mitzva at its proper time (BHL �431).
</p>
<p>
One should not even begin studying Torah once the time for <em>bedikat hametz</em> has arrived. If one began studying Torah beforehand, some    <em>poskim</em> rule that he may continue studying (<em>Beit Yosef</em>). Nonetheless, according to many <em>poskim</em>, even in this situation it is best
to stop studying at <em>tzeit ha-kokhavim</em>, in order to fulfill the mitzva of <em>bedikat hametz</em> at its proper time (MB 431:11;    <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>23).
</p>
<p>
It is best not to cancel a regular, public Torah lecture at this time. Proceeding with the study will not cause participants to neglect the mitzva of<em>bedikat hametz</em>, for the search can be performed after the lesson, but canceling the lecture will result in the loss of group Torah study (SA    <em> Ha-Rav</em> 431:9). However, the participants should remind each other after the lesson to be prompt about searching for <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. The <em>Berakha</em>
</h2>
<p>
Before beginning to search for <em>hametz</em>, one recites the <em>berakha </em>"Who sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us concerning    <em>bi'ur hametz</em>" ("<em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu al bi'ur hametz"</em>).<em> </em>Though the actual <em>bi'ur hametz</em> will not take
    place until the following morning with the burning and nullification of <em>hametz</em>, we nonetheless recite "<em>al bi'ur hametz</em>" before the search
    on the night of the fourteenth, because <em>bedikat hametz</em> is the first step in the process of eliminating <em>hametz</em> from the home.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
After the <em>berakha</em>, it is forbidden to talk before beginning the search. If at this point one talks about matters unrelated to    <em>bedikat hametz</em>, he has abandoned that <em>berakha</em> and must recite another. If, however, one talks about unrelated matters <em>after</em>
    beginning the search, his <em>berakha</em> remains valid, for it applies to the portion of the search that was already carried out. One should preferably
    avoid talking about unrelated matters during the search, in order not to become distracted (SA 432:1; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 5, 6).
</p>
<p>
    One who owns several houses must search them all. He recites the <em>berakha</em> before searching in the first location. He recites it only once, even if
    the houses are located a distance from one another.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
If one must travel, and therefore performed <em>bedikat hametz</em> before the fourteenth of Nisan, even though his search is valid, he does not recite the    <em>berakha</em>. One only recites the <em>berakha</em> over a search performed from the night of the fourteenth onward, because such a search is adjacent
    to <em>bi'ur hametz</em>. Any <em>hametz</em> found on the evening of the fourteenth will be destroyed the next morning. If one was unable to search on the
    evening of the fourteenth, and instead searched the following day, or during Pesah, he recites the <em>berakha</em>, because he will immediately destroy
    any <em>hametz</em> he finds, and it is appropriate to recite "<em>al</em> <em>bi'ur hametz</em>" over such a search. But if one searches before the
    fourteenth, he does not recite the <em>berakha</em> (Rema 436:1 and BHL <em>ad loc.</em>; MB 435:5).

</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Places That Must Be Searched
</h2>
<p>
    Any property owned by a Jew that might contain a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> must be searched. Therefore, the kitchen and the dining room where
    people eat must be searched, and any room, storage space, or porch where people sometimes bring <em>hametz</em> must also be searched (SA 433:3-4).
</p>
<p>
    Clothing closets that are not generally used during the course of a meal need not be searched. However, if there are children in the house, closets must be
    searched, because the children may have opened them while handling <em>hametz</em>, or may have even hidden <em>hametz</em> in them. Closets that are too
    high for children to reach need not be searched.
</p>
<p>
    One must also search cars and carrying bags in which he sometimes puts food. Adults who generally do not put food in their pockets need not search them.
    However, the pockets of children must be searched. Garments that were washed and had their pockets emptied out beforehand need not be searched on the night
    of the fourteenth (see section 8 of the present chapter). One who does not have a home does not recite the <em>berakha</em> when searching his car or
    pockets, for the Sages instituted saying a <em>berakha</em> only when searching a house (<em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 433:91).
</p>
<p>
    The stairwell of an apartment building or condominium is shared by all of the building's occupants, and therefore they have a collective obligation to
    search it. In such a case, one of the occupants should be given the responsibility of performing <em>bedikat hametz</em>. Open yards need not be searched
    because we can reasonably assume that animals ate any <em>hametz</em> that might have been there. However, if there are alcoves in the yard that might
    contain <em>hametz</em>, they must be searched, because animals may not have crawled into them to eat the <em>hametz</em>. Likewise, if one knows for
    certain that there was <em>hametz</em> in his yard on the night of the fourteenth, he must search it, because he cannot be certain that animals will eat it
    by noon of the fourteenth (MB 433:27, citing <em>Mekor Hayim</em>). An enclosed porch, even if it opens into a yard, must be searched.
</p>
<p>
Ownerless public domains need not be searched, for even if they contain <em>hametz</em>, no violation has been committed. This is because such    <em>hametz</em> is not in the possession of any particular Jew, and the <em>hametz</em> prohibition only applies where <em>hametz</em> is in the possession
    of a Jew, and not in an ownerless domain (SA 445:3; MB <em>ad loc. </em>18. Garbage bins are discussed below, 5:5).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. The Candle and the Flashlight     
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages ordained that <em>bedikat hametz</em> be performed by candlelight, because candlelight is focused and effective for searching. During the day,
    the light of the sun detracts from the brightness of the candle, and it is difficult for the eye to focus on its weak light. Therefore, the Sages ordained
    searching at night, because at night candlelight is more brilliant and does a good job of illuminating holes and crevices, where the essence of the search
    is carried out.
</p>
<p>
    One may not search for <em>hametz</em> by torchlight, i.e., with a candle that has two or more separate wicks. There are several reasons for this, the main
    one being that the large flame will cause the searcher to worry about burning something, and as a result not be able to concentrate on the search. If one
    erred and searched by torchlight, he did not fulfill his obligation. Additionally, one may not search by the light of an oil lamp, because the fear of
    spilling oil and staining his belongings will deter him from maneuvering the lamp into narrow spaces to get a good look at cracks and crevices. Likewise,
    one should not use a paraffin candle for <em>bedikat hametz</em>. Therefore, the widespread custom is to prefer wax candles, because they do not drip
    excessively (SA and MB 433:2).
</p>
<p>
    In principle, it is permissible to use a flashlight for <em>bedikat hametz</em>; the Sages ordained using a candle because its light is focused, and the
    light of a flashlight is focused. Moreover, a flashlight has an advantage in that one need not worry about burning things or spilling wax and oil, and if
    it is a good flashlight, its light is stronger and more focused than a candle's. Nonetheless, some people are strict and do not search with a flashlight
    because the Sages derived from Scriptural verses that the search for <em>hametz</em> should be performed with a candle (<em>Pesahim</em> 7b). Yet a
flashlight can also be considered a kind of candle, for the filament is like the flame and the battery is like the oil (    <em>She'arim Metzuyanim Be-halakha</em> 111:4).
</p>
<p>
    In practice, the prevailing custom is to search by candlelight, in keeping with the practice of the Sages. However, one who wishes to search with a
    flashlight may do so with a <em>berakha</em>, and in places where the searcher is concerned that the candle will cause a fire, it is preferable to search
    with a flashlight (see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 13:10; <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 1:4).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. Must One Search for Less than a <em>Kezayit</em> of <em>Hametz</em>?
</h2>
<p>
The purpose of <em>bedikat hametz</em> is to find pieces of <em>hametz</em> that are a <em>kezayit</em> or larger, for one only violates    <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em> if there is a <em>kezayit</em> or more of <em>hametz</em> in one place in his home. Therefore, any part of
    the house into which people sometimes bring <em>hametz</em> must be searched. In a house where children are present, one must search all of the places that
    children enter; however, one need not search closets or shelves that are out of the reach of children.
</p>
<p>
    Some <em>poskim</em> take the stringent position that the purpose of the search is to ensure that not a single edible crumb of <em>hametz</em> remains in
    one's possession, for if even one crumb remains, somebody might mistakenly eat it during Pesah and thus transgress a Torah prohibition. Even though there
    is no punishment for eating less than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em>, the Torah nonetheless prohibits it. According to this position, one must
    search the entire house meticulously and keep an eye out for even small crumbs that might be <em>hametz</em>. Such a search in a normal house should take
    at least two hours. However, even according to stringent opinions, one need not search for crumbs so small that they are not recognizable as food.
    Likewise, there is no need to search for crumbs so filthy that they are inedible. For example, it is not necessary to inspect the cracks between floor
    tiles, because the crumbs there are repulsive and not fit to be eaten.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, one who chooses to be stringent and search for crumbs smaller than a <em>kezayit</em> is praiseworthy, but the <em>halakha</em> follows the
    lenient opinion. The reason is that the obligation to search for <em>hametz</em> is rabbinically ordained. According to the Torah, one who mentally
    nullifies his <em>hametz</em> has already avoided the prohibition of <em>hametz</em> and need not search his home. It is the Sages who ordained that, in
    addition to the <em>bitul</em>, we must seek and destroy <em>hametz</em>. Whenever there is a disagreement about a rabbinic enactment, the lenient opinion
    is generally preferred.
</p>
<p>
    All this applies to the house in general, but it goes without saying that any object that will come into contact with food during Pesah must be thoroughly
    cleaned, for even the slightest amount of <em>hametz</em> renders food forbidden on Pesah. Therefore, the dining table, countertops, and cabinets must all
    be cleaned so well that not a single crumb of <em>hametz</em> remains.

</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. Do Books Require <em>Bedikat Hametz</em>?   
</h2>
<p>
    According to several Aharonim, one is required to search all of his books, page by page, because a crumb of <em>hametz</em> might have fallen into one of
    them. These authorities maintain that the objective of <em>bedikat</em> <em>hametz</em> is to remove every crumb of <em>hametz</em> from one's possession,
    and this was the practice of Hazon Ish: he would check page by page the books he planned to read on Pesah and then sell the rest of his books to a gentile
    and put a partition in front of them. In this manner, he exempted himself from the obligation to search them all.
</p>
<p>
However, according to those <em>poskim</em> who maintain that the purpose of <em>bedikat hametz</em> is to find pieces of <em>hametz</em> the size of a<em>kezayit</em>, clearly there is no need for such a thorough search of books, for it is inconceivable that there could be a <em>kezayit</em> of    <em>hametz</em> between the pages of a book. In fact, even some of the stringent <em>poskim</em> who say that all <em>hametz</em> must be sought out
    maintain that one is not required to search for the sort of tiny crumbs one is liable to find in books, because even if one sees them on Pesah, there is
    little concern that one will want to eat them.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, one should not search his books page by page, because this is overly stringent behavior and is even liable to result in a waste of Torah-study
    time. Indeed, the accepted practice is not to be stringent in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, one should not put books on the dining table during Pesah unless he was careful to distance them from <em>hametz</em> throughout the year.
    Such books might contain a crumb of <em>hametz</em>, which could fall into some food on Pesah, and any amount of <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is forbidden,
    even if it is mixed with a much greater quantity of other foodstuffs. It is permissible, though, to read such books on a table at which one does not eat.
</p>
<p>
    If during the year one places such books on the dining table between meals, he must be careful to clean the table well after eating, so that not a single
    crumb remains. Even the stringent <em>poskim</em> maintain that one who is careful all year long to distance his books from <em>hametz</em>, and when
    bringing them to the dining table is careful that no crumbs of <em>hametz</em> fall into them, is not required to search his books, because they are
    already considered <em>hametz</em>-free.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    The status of the bookcase itself depends upon the household. If there are no children, and the adults are careful not to put any food on the bookshelves,
    no search is required. If there are children in the house who may have placed food there, one is required to search among the books and behind them. If the
    bookshelf was cleaned well beforehand, a casual search is sufficient.
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. Do We Rely upon the Cleaning Done before Pesah?    
</h2>
<p>
    Most Jewish families clean their homes thoroughly before Pesah. Any part of the house that was cleaned well, and into which people were careful not to
    bring <em>hametz</em> afterward, does not require a thorough search (<em>Sha'arei Teshuva</em> 433:1; <em>Da'at Torah</em> 433:2).
</p>
<p>
    However, some <em>poskim</em> take a stringent position in this regard and assert that the cleaning does not change a thing, for the Sages ordained
    searching the cracks and crevices of one's entire home on the night of the fourteenth. Other <em>poskim</em> are stringent on the grounds that one cannot
rely upon previous cleaning unless it was carried out at night by the light of a candle. Only in this manner, they maintain, is it possible to discern the    <em>hametz</em> in the cracks and crevices.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, though, the custom is to follow the lenient approach and to perform a relatively cursory search of all those places that were cleaned
    beforehand. This makes sense, for if a room has been cleaned well, and afterward, people were careful not to enter with <em>hametz</em>, it has the status
    of a place into which no <em>hametz</em> was ever brought, which in principle does not need to be searched. Although a search is not effective unless it
    was carried out at night by the light of a candle, a thorough cleaning is more effective than searching. For example, when one cleans a clothing closet, he
takes out all of its contents and wipes off all of the shelves. After this, the chances of <em>hametz</em> remaining are less than the chances of finding    <em>hametz</em> remaining there after a thorough search on the night of the fourteenth by candlelight.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, even after such a thorough cleaning one must search for <em>hametz</em> with a <em>berakha</em> on the night of the fourteenth, because the
dining area certainly needs to be searched. In addition, one may have forgotten to clean a closet, drawer, or corner. Thus, when performing    <em>bedikat hametz</em>, one must search the entire house and confirm that everything has indeed been cleaned well. If the one performing the search did
    not participate in the cleaning, he must ask those who cleaned to search with him so that he may ask them if each part of the house he inspects was
    properly cleaned. Alternatively, they can mark all properly cleaned places with stickers, and all such places need only be given a cursory search.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    However, even when performing a casual search, one must check every corner of the room, along the walls, and between the furniture, and one must open every
    closet and drawer that could possibly contain <em>hametz</em>, in order to assure that they are indeed clean and remain so. Searching a room in this manner
    should take no more than a few minutes.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
9. Hiding Pieces of Bread and Receiving Help from Family Members 
</h2>
<p>
    It is customary hide pieces of bread before <em>bedikat hametz</em>, so that the person performing the search will have to discover them. Some maintain
    that this custom is meant to ensure that the searcher finds <em>hametz</em>, because if he does not his <em>berakha</em> may have been in vain. In truth,
    though, this is not the case, for even if no <em>hametz</em> was discovered, there is no <em>berakha le-vatala</em>, since the objective of the search is
to ensure that there is no <em>hametz</em> in the house, and this objective is achieved even if no <em>hametz </em>is found. In addition, the    <em>berakha</em> is not on the search alone; rather, it covers the entire process of <em>hametz</em> removal, which begins with the <em>bedika</em> and
ends with the <em>bi'ur</em> and <em>bitul</em> of the <em>hametz </em>the following day. This is evident from the fact that the <em>berakha</em> is "    <em>al bi'ur</em> <em>hametz</em>," and not "<em>al bedikat</em> <em>hametz</em>." Thus, even if one does not find <em>hametz</em> in his search, he
    continues the process of removing the <em>hametz</em> the next morning, and hence his <em>berakha</em> in not in vain (Rema 432:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 13).
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, this Jewish custom should not be discontinued. Arizal himself had a custom to scatter ten pieces of bread before his search. Some    <em>poskim</em> explain that the reason for this practice is so that some <em>hametz</em> will remain after the search, and thus one will not forget to
    nullify his <em>hametz</em>. Another explanation is that these pieces will ensure that one is not negligent in his search (<em>Hok Yaakov</em> 432:14).
    Therefore, where the house has received a thorough cleaning, and in principle a casual search is sufficient, the pieces of bread should be put in places
    where they can be found without much trouble; but where the house has not been cleaned well, they should be hidden more carefully. At any rate, it is a
    good idea for the person who scatters them to make a list of where he hid them, so that if they are not found initially, it will still be possible to
    locate and remove them.
</p>
<p>
    After the search, one should nullify the <em>hametz</em> that he did not find and might remain in the house (as will be explained in 5:1). One must
    exercise extreme caution with the <em>hametz</em> that was found and the <em>hametz</em> that he plans to eat until the following morning, making sure that
    they not become scattered about the house.
</p>
<p>
    If it is difficult for one to search the entire house on his own, he may ask family members to help him. In this case, they should stand next to him while
    he recites the <em>berakha</em> and answer "amen." Then they should spread out in the house to search it. If the homeowner is unable to perform the search,
    he should ask somebody else to search for him, and the searcher says the <em>berakha</em> (SA 432:2; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 10).
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
10. One Who Travels
</h2>
<p>
    If one travels abroad before Pesah and plans to return home after Pesah, his performance of <em>bedikat hametz</em> depends on when he departs: if he
    departs within thirty days of Pesah, i.e., from Purim onward, he must search his home for <em>hametz</em> before leaving. That he will certainly nullify
his <em>hametz</em> has no bearing, because, as we have learned, the Sages ordained that in addition to <em>bitul hametz</em>, one must perform    <em>bedikat hametz</em>, and since he is still at home within the thirty days before Pesah, the mitzva of <em>bedikat hametz</em> already applies to him.
    Therefore, he must perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> on his last night at home. However, he does not say a <em>berakha</em> over this search because it is
    conducted before the time the Sages ordained for searching (as explained in 3:4 above).
</p>
<p>
    If one leaves home more than thirty days before Pesah, i.e., before Purim, he need not perform a search before he leaves. Then, on Erev Pesah, he must
    nullify all of the <em>hametz</em> in his possession so that he does not transgress by possessing <em>hametz</em>. When he returns home after Pesah, he
    must physically dispose of all of the <em>hametz </em>in his home.
</p>
<p>
    However, if at the time of departure one intended to return to his home before Pesah, the Sages ordained that he must perform <em>bedikat hametz</em>
    before leaving, even if he sets out at the beginning of the year. This is because something could go wrong on his journey, preventing him from returning in
    time for <em>bedikat hametz</em> (<em>Pesahim</em> 6a, according to Rambam). However, if one appoints a <em>shali'ah</em> to search on his behalf on the
    night of the fourteenth in case he is unable to return in time, he is not required to search before his departure. Nowadays, when one can make a phone call
    from anywhere in the world, one need not search before setting out on a trip because even if he is unable to return in time for <em>bedikat hametz</em>, he
    can ask a friend or relative to search on his behalf (see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 12:13).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> differ over what should be done when one was supposed to perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> before traveling but forgot to do so. Some say
he must return and others say he need not. Therefore, if it is very difficult for him to return, and he cannot find a <em>shali'ah</em> to perform<em>bedikat hametz</em> for him, he may rely upon his <em>bitul hametz</em> (BHL 436:1, s.v. "zakuk"). Then, after Pesah, he must burn or destroy the    <em>hametz</em> he nullified, because if he derives benefit from it after Pesah, he demonstrates that his nullification was insincere. The same applies any
    time one nullifies <em>hametz</em> but does not remove it - the Sages forbid eating or deriving benefit from it after Pesah (SA 448:5). The best thing to
    do when one forgot to search his house before traveling is to rent it to a gentile and sell him all of the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>
11. Does Renting One's Entire House to a Gentile Exempt It from <em>Bedikat Hametz</em>?
</h2>
<p>
Some families leave home for the entire Pesah holiday, and the question arises: Can these people exempt themselves from cleaning and searching for    <em>hametz</em> by selling or renting their entire house to a gentile?
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> differ on this issue. Some take the lenient position that since the house is not actually in the owner's possession on Erev Pesah, he
    is not obligated to search it (<em>Hok Yaakov</em>; Gra's understanding of <em>Tur</em> and Rema). Many others, however, take the stringent position that
    since the owner lives in this house during the thirty days prior to Pesah, it becomes incumbent upon him to perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> there. Only if
    he moves to another house in which he will become obligated to search for <em>hametz</em> will he be exempt from searching the house he rented or sold to
    the gentile (SA 436:3, MA<em> ad loc.</em>, and SA <em>Ha-Rav</em>'s understanding of <em>Tur</em> and Rema). In addition, it is inappropriate for one to
    avoid performing the mitzva of <em>bedikat hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
In practice, in order to satisfy all opinions, one should sell or rent his entire house except for one room, and in it he fulfills the mitzva of    <em>bedikat hametz</em>. Once one has fulfilled the mitzva of <em>bedikat hametz</em> in this room, all <em>poskim</em> agree that there is no need to
    search the rooms that have been sold or rented to a gentile.
</p>
<p>
    In Eretz Yisrael, it is forbidden to sell a house to a gentile (SA YD 151:8), and it must therefore be made clear in the sale of <em>hametz</em> contract
    that a rental is being transacted. In addition, the homeowner must sell the <em>hametz</em> in all of the rented rooms, and by doing this, he becomes
    exempt from searching these rooms.

</p>
<p>
    When possible, it is best to rent one's house before the night of the fourteenth, because some <em>poskim</em> maintain that if, on the night of the
    fourteenth, the rooms are still in the homeowner's possession, he becomes obligated to search them (<em>Mekor Hayim</em> and <em>Hayei Adam</em>). When it
    is difficult to rent out the house before the night of the fourteenth, as most rabbinical authorities execute the sale (and rental) on the morning of the
fourteenth, one may rely on the lenient opinions. Since he intends to rent out these rooms, there is no longer a fear that he will violate    <em>bal yera'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>, and he therefore need not search them (<em>Binyan Olam</em>, <em>Hatam Sofer</em>, as cited in MB 436:2).
</p>
<p>
    The utensils and the stove should be cleaned of all substantial <em>hametz</em> before Pesah, for if this is not done, it will be necessary to clean them
    after Pesah in order to avoid eating <em>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesah </em>(<em>hametz</em> that remained in a Jew's possession during Pesah). However, it
    is not advisable to sell the utensils to a gentile, because this will necessitate immersing them in a <em>mikveh</em> after Pesah, in keeping with the law
    regarding utensils bought from a gentile. To sell the <em>hametz</em> on them, or absorbed into them, makes no sense at all, as will be explained in 6:4
    below.

12. <em>Bedikat Hametz</em> after the Proper Time and the Status of One Who Rents a Hotel Room
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages ordained searching for <em>hametz</em> on the night of the fourteenth of Nisan. If one did not search at this time, he is required to do so on
the fourteenth by day, and to say a <em>berakha </em>over the search. If one did not search before Pesah at all, he must search on Pesah, with a    <em>berakha</em>. The fact that he nullified his <em>hametz</em> before Pesah does not change this<em>,</em> because he is still required to fulfill the
    Sages' enactment, and secondly, because there is a possibility that he will come across some <em>hametz</em> during Pesah and, forgetting the prohibition,
    eat it. If, after Pesah, one suddenly realizes that he did not perform <em>bedikat hametz</em>, he must do so, in order not to violate the rabbinic
    prohibition of <em>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesah</em>. This search, however, requires no blessing (SA �435).
</p>
<p>
    One who rents a hotel room has the status of a tenant. This is because he pays for the room, it is at his disposal, he receives a key to lock and unlock
    it, and strangers and hotel personnel are only allowed to enter with his permission. Therefore, he is commanded to recite a <em>berakha</em> and search his
    room on the night of the fourteenth, and afterward he must nullify any <em>hametz</em> in his possession that may have gone undiscovered. One who checks
    into a hotel during Pesah must inquire whether the rooms were searched for <em>hametz</em>. If they were not searched for <em>hametz</em>, but were merely
    cleaned in the routine manner, the guest himself is obligated to search. In this case, no <em>berakha</em> is required.
</p>
<p>
    A hospital patient is required to search his room and his closet on the night of the fourteenth. However, no <em>berakha</em> is said over this<em> </em>
    search, since the room is not at his disposal; at any time he can be moved to a different room, and other patients can be moved into his room.
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
A hotel owner is required to perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> in every room of his hotel, and if it is difficult for him to do this himself, he can hire a    <em>shali'ah</em>. Regarding rooms rented to gentiles, or to Jews who do not perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> on the night of the fourteenth, a problem
    arises. On the one hand, the rooms are rented to them, and the owner cannot force them to keep <em>halakha </em>and search for <em>hametz</em>. On the
    other hand, if they vacate during the holiday, he will have to search their rooms immediately and remove any <em>hametz</em> left behind, and he might not
    have time to do this. The solution, therefore, is to sell or rent all the hotel rooms to a gentile before Pesah, and to have the hotel owner serve as an
    intermediary during<em> </em>Pesah between the gentile and the guests.

13. Synagogue, Dormitory, and Yeshiva    
</h2>
<p>
Synagogues and <em>batei midrash </em>(Torah study halls) require <em>bedikat hametz</em> on the night of the fourteenth, because people sometimes eat    <em>hametz</em> in them. This is true even of synagogues where people generally do not eat, for children sometimes enter them with <em>hametz</em> (SA
    433:10). However, when it comes to saying a <em>berakha</em> over this search, there is some uncertainty. Therefore, it is best that the person responsible
    for searching the <em>beit knesset</em> first search his own home, and when saying the <em>berakha</em> there, intend to include the synagogue.
    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
    Boys or girls living in a dormitory and paying for this facility have the status of tenants, and if a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> remains in their
    room during Pesah they violate <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>. Therefore, they are obligated to search their rooms before Pesah, and if
    they will be staying there during Pesah, they are required to search on the night of the fourteenth with a <em>berakha</em>. If they leave the dormitory a
    number of days before Pesah, they are required to search on the night before they leave, without reciting a <em>berakha</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p>
    The responsibility for searching the rest of the rooms and halls in the yeshiva belongs to the yeshiva administration. It is also possible for them to sell
    the rooms to a gentile and thus exempt themselves from the obligation to search.
</p>
<p>
One who buys or begins renting a home before Pesah must search it even if he has not yet occupied it, because the previous resident may have left some    <em>hametz</em> there. Since the house is in his possession, this <em>hametz</em> will cause him to violate <em>bal yera'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>.
    If he owns another house where he will be fulfilling the mitzva of <em>bedikat hametz</em>, he can sell or rent out the new home to a gentile and thus
    exempt himself from the obligation to search it (see section 11 of this chapter above).
</p>

14. <em>Hametz</em> Buried under a Pile of Dirt and the Question of Searching a Storeroom
</h2>
<p>
    If <em>hametz</em> is buried under less than three <em>tefahim </em>(24 cm) of stones, dirt, and the like, it is not considered to have been disposed of,
    and it must be uncovered and disposed of before Pesah. This is because it is possible for a dog to smell it and dig it up.
</p>
<p>
    However, if the <em>hametz</em> is covered by more than three <em>tefahim</em>, it is considered to have been disposed of and does not cause one to
    transgress <em>bal yera'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>. Therefore, it need not be dug up and disposed of. <em>Bitul hametz</em> is nonetheless required,
    because it is possible that some of the stones will be moved during Pesah, and the <em>hametz</em> will no longer be covered by three <em>tefahim</em>,
    causing the person to violate <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
Likewise, in a case where <em>hametz</em> falls into a pit in one's yard, if it is the sort of pit one does not generally enter, one may nullify the    <em>hametz</em> without extracting and disposing it.
</p>
<p>
    Accordingly, if <em>hametz</em> is stuck behind a wall cabinet and impossible to remove without first taking the cabinet apart or emptying it out and
    moving it, one need not remove the <em>hametz</em>. In this case, one may rely upon its <em>bitul</em> (SAH 333:19). If <em>hametz</em> is located where it
    can only be removed with some difficulty, one may pour bleach or soapy water on it until it is no longer fit for consumption, and hence no longer
    considered food (not even for an animal). Once this has been done, it need not be removed.
</p>
<p>
    A storage room where one keeps articles not in use or merchandise that he does not intend to use until after Pesah need not be searched for <em>hametz</em>
    . It is sufficient to nullify any <em>hametz</em> that might be there. However, if one wishes to fill the storage room during the thirty days prior to
    Pesah, he must search it first, because the obligation to prepare for Pesah has already taken effect. If one did not search it beforehand, it must be
    thoroughly searched for <em>hametz</em> on the night of the fourteenth (SA 336:1). If it is difficult to move all of the storeroom's contents in order to
    carry out the search, one may sell or rent it to a gentile and thus exempt oneself from the obligation to perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> there.

            . Some have suggested one who wishes to engage in the search himself should appoint one of his family members to search the house at the proper
            time and leave one room unchecked; when he returns later that night he can search the unchecked room. He should be sure to ask them to remind him
            to check the room when he returns, or if he does not return, to check the room themselves (<em>Teshuvot Ve-hanhagot</em> 2:214). However, it seems
            to me that if there is someone in the house who can perform the search instead, it is better to appoint this person as a <em>shali'ah </em>to
conduct the search of the entire house at the appropriate time. This issue is dependent upon a fundamental question: did the Sages decree that the            <em>bedika</em> should be conducted specifically at the beginning of the night, or is the entire night acceptable for <em>bedika</em> since the
candlelight is more visible at night, but in order to prevent a person from forgetting to check, they forbade working and eating before the            <em>bedika</em>? According to most <em>poskim</em>, the primary time for the <em>bedika</em> is at the beginning of the night. This is the opinion
            of <em>Taz, Pri Hadash, </em>Gra<em>, </em>and SAH in 431:5. Conversely, Rema and <em>Mekor Hayim</em> maintain that the <em>bedika</em> can be
            done throughout the entire night. Thus according to them, one may be more lenient about postponing the <em>bedika</em> as long as there is someone
            who will remind him to check later on. I have written in accordance with the view of most <em>poskim</em>, and in the next section,<em> </em>I have
written that it is proper to refrain from eating even casually once the time for <em>bedikat hametz</em> has arrived, so as not to delay the            <em>bedika</em>.

            . If one forgot to make the <em>berakha</em> before the <em>bedika</em> and remembered while in the middle, as long as he has other areas to check,
            he may still make the <em>berakha.</em> However, if he remembered after the completion of the <em>bedika</em>, the <em>poskim</em> disagree about
            whether he can make the <em>berakha</em> before burning the <em>hametz</em> the following day. According to MB 432:4, we do not prevent someone
            from making the <em>berakha</em> in this situation, since the <em>berakha</em> is on the burning of the <em>hametz</em>; thus, as long as he has
not yet burned the <em>hametz</em>, he can make the <em>berakha.</em> On the other hand, there are those who hold that the Sages enacted the<em>berakha</em> on the <em>bedika</em> and not on the burning, and therefore if one forgot to make the <em>berakha </em>by the end of the            <em>bedika</em>, he has lost his opportunity to do so. This is the opinion of <em>Bah</em>, SAH, and others. When in doubt about whether or not to
make a <em>berakha</em>, we are lenient, and so one should not make the <em>berakha</em>. One should not make a <em>berakha</em> on            <em>bitul hametz</em> alone, since we do not make <em>berakhot</em> on mere words or thoughts.

            distance is considered a significant interruption, and he would have to make a new <em>berakha.</em> Conversely, according to <em>Hok Yaakov</em>
            and <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em>, walking is not considered a significant interruption. This is also the opinion of <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 432:22.
            When in doubt about whether or not to make a <em>berakha</em>, we are lenient. The Aharonim also disagree about whether a <em>shali'ah </em>

            . Indeed according to Ra'ah and <em>Pri Hadash</em>, one who is halakhically required to check should make a <em>berakha</em>, since the purpose of
            the <em>bedika</em> is to ensure that he does not violate <em>bal yeira'eh/bal yimatzei</em> afterward; since the Sages decreed that one who leaves
his house before the night of the fourteenth should check before he leaves, he should also make a <em>berakha</em>. According to Ritva and            <em>Bah</em>, he should make the <em>berakha</em> as long as he checks within the thirty days before Pesah. But, as noted, <em>Kol Bo</em> and Rema
            (436:1) are of the opinion that the <em>berakha</em> is also on the burning that takes place the following morning. This is also the opinion of
            Gra, and seems to be the conclusion of MA<em>, Taz, </em>and others. If one is uncertain about the <em>berakha</em>, we are lenient, and this seems

            since it is a mitzva that comes periodically, and there are those who say not to recite this <em>berakha</em>. Rosh rules that one should not make
this <em>berakha, </em>since the <em>bedika</em> is connected to the Pesah holiday, when anyway he will recite <em>she-heheyanu</em>.            <em>Shulhan Arukh</em><em> </em>does not even mention the idea of <em>she-heheyanu</em> on the <em>bedika</em>. However, some Aharonim suggest, as
            a nice custom, that one take a new fruit or new garment and recite <em>she-heheyanu</em> on it before the <em>bedika</em> (<em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em>

            . SAH<em> </em>explains in 446, <em>Kuntrus Aharon</em> 1, that according to most Rishonim, there is no need to burn a piece of <em>hametz</em>
            smaller than a <em>kezayit</em> (see <em>Birur Halakha</em> 45:1 on the topic of dough in the cracks of a kneading tub). MB 442:33 cites a dispute
            about whether one must destroy a piece of <em>hametz</em> smaller than a <em>kezayit</em>: some say that since one transgresses a prohibition by
            eating it on Pesah, he must burn it beforehand; others are more lenient and would not require him to burn it.
        </p>
        <p>
            SHT <em>ad loc. </em>mentions that the practice is to be stringent and burn this <em>hametz</em>, but does not discuss whether one must search for
crumbs smaller than a <em>kezayit</em> during <em>bedikat hametz</em>. However, it seems from the comments in 442:60 that the main point of the<em>bedikat hametz</em> is specifically to find <em>hametz</em> that is larger than a <em>kezayit</em>, and indeed this is the opinion of            <em>Pri Hadash</em> and many other halakhic authorities. On the other hand, <em>Hayei Adam</em> (109:6) rules stringently that one must search even
            for small crumbs. This is also the view of <em>Hazon Ish</em> (OH 116:13, 17).
        </p>
        <p>
            Ostensibly, it is possible to connect this dispute to a disagreement about the purpose of <em>bedikat hametz</em>. According to Rashi, the purpose
            of <em>bedikat hametz</em> is to prevent one from transgressing the Torah prohibitions of <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>, which,
            according to almost all authorities, one does not violate with less than a <em>kezayit </em>of <em>hametz</em>. <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em> explains
            that small amounts of <em>hametz</em> do not combine ("<em>lo hazi le-itztarufei</em>")<em> </em>to cause one to transgress <em>bal yera'eh</em>
and <em>bal yimatzei</em>, unlike small amounts of forbidden foods, which combine to the size of a <em>kezayit</em> (according to<em>Hakham Zvi</em>, since there is no action involved in the violation of <em>bal yera'eh</em> and <em>bal yimatzei</em>, the principle of "            <em>ahshevei</em>" does not apply)<em>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, according to <em>Tosafot</em>, since the purpose of <em>bedikat hametz</em> is to prevent one from eating any <em>hametz</em>
            that remains in his house on Pesah, one would thus be required to check for even small crumbs of edible <em>hametz</em> (and remove them from his
            home). Since we follow both Rashi's and <em>Tosafot</em>'s reasons, as Ran records both, perhaps one must be stringent in this matter. However, it
            seems that even according to <em>Tosafot</em>, despite the fact that one would violate a Torah prohibition by eating less than a <em>kezayit</em>
            of <em>hametz</em>, the Sages did not require one to check for such crumbs, since eating a piece of <em>hametz</em> this size does not incur a
            penalty of <em>karet</em>. Additionally, <em>Tosafot</em>'s concern about one finding <em>hametz</em> in his house on Pesah and eating it applies
            mainly to a nice, substantial piece of <em>hametz</em>; regarding a small crumb of <em>hametz</em>, the concern is not as severe. Even if one were
            to find, say, a small crouton somewhere in his house, it is not likely that he will eat it, since it was found where food is not normally stored.
            Furthermore, even if he does eat this small crouton, he arguably did not intend to eat it; rather, he was cleaning, and instead of throwing the
            crouton in the garbage, he put it in his mouth. Such an action is not a Torah prohibition, and not something for which the Sages<em> </em>would
            mandate <em>bedikat hametz</em>. Nevertheless, perhaps one who normally eats these types of crumbs should be stringent in accordance with the
            ruling of <em>Hazon Ish</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            See also <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> ch. 6 n. 2, which discusses the two opinions in this matter and proves the lenient approach from the
            implication of <em>Pesahim</em><em> </em>4a that <em>bedikat hametz</em> lasts for less than an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
See also <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> �13 n. 39, which rules according to the stringent opinion that one must check for crumbs, and            <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro </em>2:1, which is very strict about crumbs. However, since this is a dispute about a rabbinic injunction, practice
            follows the lenient approach. Nevertheless, one must differentiate between places to which he brings <em>hametz</em> and the rest of the house,
            similar to the distinction made regarding koshering utensils and <em>bedikat hametz</em>.

            . The opinion of Hazon Ish<em> </em>appears in <em>Hazon Ish </em>OH <em> </em>116:18. <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 2:1 is very strict about
            small crumbs, but regarding the issue of checking books, states in 3:24 that the custom is not to be strict like <em>Hazon Ish</em>, since the
            crumbs in books are extremely small and insignificant. <em>Responsa</em> <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 1:32 disagrees with <em>Hazon Ish</em> and proves
            from Rambam that one need not be concerned with <em>hametz</em><em> </em>that is smaller than a <em>kezayit</em>. However, as noted in the previous
            section, whenever there is a concern that a small crumb might mix into food, one must be stringent, and as such, one should not bring books that
            may have crumbs in them into contact with food on Pesah.

. See <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 13 (n. 1) which tends toward stringency, citing <em>Derekh Pekudekha</em> that those who do<em>bedikat hametz</em> superficially are in violation of the rabbinic enactment, and their <em>berakhot</em> may be considered in vain. See also            <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 2:5 and <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 3:16. However, as I have written, the custom is to be lenient in this matter,
as <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 433:85 states. This is true even though <em>bedikat hametz</em> with a candle during the day is not effective, as per MB            <em> </em>433:1, and even though a proper house cleaning does not exempt one from conducting <em>bedikat hametz</em>, as per SA<em> </em>433:11 and
            MA <em>ad loc. </em>20. There are two reasons mentioned (concerning the ineffectiveness of checking during the day): firstly, because only at night
            does the candle illuminate the small cracks and crevices properly, and secondly, because the Sages decreed that the <em>bedika</em> be done on the
            fourteenth of Nisan at night. Clearly, our customary checks fulfill both aspects: firstly, a full cleaning of the house accomplishes more than a
            daytime <em>bedikat hametz</em>, and since we check on the night of the fourteenth, we also fulfill the second aspect of the Sages' decree.
            Accordingly, one may not claim that he is exempt from the <em>bedika</em> after cleaning his house, or that he cannot make a <em>berakha</em> on
            the <em>bedika</em>, for the reasons I have just mentioned. (Moreover, see the next section, which will explain that according to most authorities
            there is no need to place small pieces of bread around the house for the <em>bedika</em> even though it is clear that no <em>hametz</em><em> </em>
            remains.) Since, as we have learned, <em>bedikat hametz</em> is a rabbinic decree and according to many authorities one must only search for pieces
            of <em>hametz</em> that are larger than a <em>kezayit</em>, it is certainly permissible to be lenient and rely on a cursory <em>bedika</em>,
            provided that one has already cleaned his house very well.

            . SA<em> </em>expresses the same opinion as <em>Avi Ezri</em>. The Aharonim disagreed regarding the opinion of <em>Tur</em> and Rema. According to
MA (436:17) and SAH, one is only exempt from the <em>bedika</em> if the gentile will actually enter his house before Pesah. According to            <em>Hok Yaakov</em> and Gra, even if the gentile will not actually enter the house, since the Jewish owner declared the <em>hametz</em> in it
            ownerless, there is no need for <em>bedikat hametz</em>. MB 436:32 seems to lean toward a strict ruling (see SHT <em>ad loc. </em>31-32).
        </p>
        <p>
In Israel, where it is forbidden to sell a house to a gentile, one is permitted to rent his house. However, <em>Mekor Hayim</em> 437:4 and<em>Hayei Adam</em> 119:18 in the name of <em>Eliya</em><em> Rabba</em> state that one who rents his house to a gentile still must conduct            <em>bedikat hametz</em>. Nonetheless, it seems that if one sells all of the <em>hametz</em> in his house, even these <em>poskim</em> would agree
that no <em>bedika</em> is required. This is the opinion of <em>Hatam Sofer</em> �136 and <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 6:20 (pp. 103-104),            <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda, </em>SAH<em>, </em>and<em> Kitzur </em>SA. Another benefit of renting one's house is that it is done wholeheartedly, as is
            written in <em>Beit Shlomo</em> 2:91 and <em>Zekher Yehosef</em> �238.

. The opinion of most <em>poskim</em> is that he should recite the <em>berakha</em>, since it is a mitzva. See MB 433:43 in the name of SAH            <em>.</em> But AHS 433:12 states that one of the reasons for <em>bedikat hametz</em> is to prevent violation of <em>bal yeira'eh</em>, and since a
            synagogue does not belong to any one individual, no one would violate <em>bal yeira'eh</em> on any <em>hametz</em> that remains there. Accordingly,
there is no mitzva to check the synagogue, and thus no <em>berakha</em> should be recited. See Maharsham 5:49. Nonetheless, if the synagogue or<em>beit midrash</em> belongs to one particular individual or to several partners, according to all authorities he/they must check it with a<em>berakha</em>. However, if the synagogue owner had already recited the <em>berakha</em> in his house, he need not recite another            <em>berakha</em> in the synagogue.

            . <em>Hazon Ish</em> states that even if yeshiva students will not be in their rooms over Pesah, it is preferable for them to check their rooms on
            the night of the fourteenth with a <em>berakha</em>. This opinion is quoted in <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 12:9. Some authorities debate
whether the yeshiva student is considered a renter, since the yeshiva administration can switch him to a new room at a whim (see            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 437:4). However, it appears that yeshiva administrations generally do not transfer older students to new rooms without
            prior agreement. Therefore, this is similar to a standard rental agreement where there are conditions that if breached result in the cancellation
            or abrogation of the rental agreement. Thus, older yeshiva students are considered renters of their rooms.

            . I have written in accordance with the opinion of Rashi<em>, </em>Ran<em>, </em>and the majority of <em>poskim</em> that if the <em>hametz</em> is
            covered by more than three <em>tefahim</em> it is considered destroyed, and one would not violate <em>bal yimatzei</em> with this <em>hametz</em>.
            However, the opinion of <em>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</em> is that if it is covered by something that is generally moved, the <em>hametz</em> would
            indeed be considered in the owner's possession and he would violate <em>bal yimatzei</em>. In such a case, he would only be exempt from destroying
            the <em>hametz</em> if he nullified it verbally.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a case where the <em>hametz</em> is covered by less than three <em>tefahim</em>, one would be required to remove the <em>hametz</em>, as I have
            written, but only if one is certain that there is <em>hametz</em> under this particular covering. Even if there is a danger of snakes and
            scorpions, he still must take a shovel and remove the covering to expose and destroy the <em>hametz</em>. However, if one merely suspects that
            there is <em>hametz</em> under the covering but is not certain, he is not required to check for the <em>hametz</em> if there is a danger of snakes
and scorpions, and is only required to nullify the <em>hametz</em> verbally. If there is no danger, though, he is required to check (SA 433:8, MB            <em>ad loc. </em>35). In any situation where one is required to check, he can exempt himself from checking by selling the item to a gentile.
