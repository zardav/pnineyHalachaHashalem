    Chapter Nine: <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> - The Morning Blessings
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    1. Blessings of Thanks
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of many blessings immediately upon awakening in the morning. The purpose of these blessings is to thank
    Hashem for the good that He bestows upon us every day. Hence, the Talmud (<em>Berachot</em> 60b) teaches that when a person wakes up, he must thank Hashem
    and say, "My God, the soul which you have placed within me is pure" Blessed are You Hashem who restores souls to dead bodies" (<em>Elokai Neshamah</em>).
    When he hears the sound of the rooster, announcing the arrival of a new day, he must say, "Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the universe, who gives
    the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night" (<em>Hanoten lasechvi vinah</em>). Upon opening his eyes, he recites, "...Who gives sight to
    the blind" (<em>Poke'ach ivrim</em>). When one stretches his limbs and sits on his bed, after being held captive in the shackles of sleep, he recites,
    "...Who releases the imprisoned" (<em>Matir assurim</em>). When he dresses, he recites, "...Who clothes the naked" (<em>Malbish arumim</em>). When one stands
    on his legs, he recites, "...Who straightens the bent" (<em>Zokef kefufim</em>), and when placing his feet on the ground, he recites, "...Who spreads the earth
upon the waters" (<em>Roka ha'aretz al hamayim</em>). When one puts on his shoes, he recites, "...Who has provided me with all my needs" (    <em>She'asah li kol tzorki</em>). As he begins to walk, he recites, "...Who prepares people's footsteps" (<em>Hamechin mitzadei gaver</em>). When he fastens
his belt, he recites, "...Who girds Israel with strength" (<em>Ozer Yisrael bigevurah</em>). When he puts on a head covering, be it a hat or a    <em>kippah</em>, he recites, "...Who crowns Israel with glory" (<em>Oter Yisrael b'tifarah</em>). When he washes his hands, he recites, "...Concerning the
washing of hands" (<em>Al netilat yadayim</em>). When washing his face, he recites, "...Who removes sleep from my eyes" (    <em>Hama'avir chevlei sheinah me'einai</em>), etc. The <em>Chachamim</em> also instituted three special <em>berachot</em> of thanks which express gratitude
    to Hashem for choosing us and giving us His <em>mitzvot. </em>They are: "...For not having made me a gentile" (<em>Shelo asani goy</em>), "...For not having
    made me a slave" (<em>Shelo asani aved</em>) and "...For not having made me a woman" (<em>Shelo asani ishah</em>) Women recite, "...For having made me
    according to His will" (<em>She'asani kirtzono</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Life's routine generally wears away our attention from all the good that Hashem showers upon us. As a consequence of this ungratefulness, the daily
    blessing that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> grants a person fails to delight him, and his life becomes dull and empty. In order to emerge from this
    desolation, he seeks out various pleasures. Hence, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> so that we will not be ungrateful<em>.</em>
    With these blessings we thank our Creator for all things, big and small, that help us function in this world. Out of this thankfulness to Hashem, we are
    privileged to observe the world with a rich and comprehensive outlook. We learn that every single element in our lives has Godly value, arousing our desire
    to add goodness to the world with every new day that God gives us.
</p>

    2. The Order of the Morning Blessings
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    As we have learned, the original institution of the <em>Chachamim</em> was to bless and give thanks for each and every act immediately upon deriving
    pleasure from it. In other words, as a person wakes from his sleep, he thanks Hashem for the soul He placed within him and says <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>;
    as he opens his eyes, he recites <em>Poke'ach ivrim</em>; as he stretches his limbs, he recites, <em>Matir assurim</em>; and so on with all the blessings
    in that manner. However, today the custom has changed and usually all <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> are recited consecutively.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may wonder why the custom changed, for it is obviously more appropriate to thank Hashem immediately when the pleasure is received. In that way the
    process of arising from one's sleep attains profound significance, as the blessings of thanks to Hashem accompany each and every stage of waking. Indeed,
    the <em>Rambam</em> rules that all <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> must be recited exactly as mentioned in the Talmud, each <em>berachah</em> in its appropriate
    time. There are some Yemenites who are accustomed to following his ruling even today.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, the widespread custom is to recite all <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> at once, either in synagogue, or at home after relieving oneself and getting
    dressed. There are a few reasons for this. First, the <em>Chachamim</em> established that the <em>chazan</em> recites <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> out loud in
    synagogue so that the uneducated who do not know them by heart may fulfill their obligation as well. Also, even those who do know the blessings by heart
    may forget a blessing in the disorientation of waking, while if they recite them from a <em>siddur</em> in synagogue, they will remember to say them all.
    Further, we want to enhance the mitzvah and recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> in the most respectful way, with clean hands and while properly dressed, and
    therefore we delay the recital of the <em>berachot</em> until after all the preparations for prayer are finished (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 46:2). Moreover,
    there are people who find it very difficult to concentrate immediately upon waking up, and only after they dress and wash their faces are they able to
    recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> with <em>kavanah</em> (<em>Seder HaYom</em>).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    3. <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> for One Who Does Not Derive Pleasure
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is a dispute among prominent <em>Rishonim</em> regarding the question of whether a person may recite one of the <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> from which
    he does not derive direct personal pleasure. For instance, may a blind person recite the <em>berachah</em>, <em>Poke'ach ivrim</em>?
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Rambam</em> (<em>Tefillah</em> 7:9), only a person who derives pleasure from something may recite a blessing on it. Therefore, a
    person who slept at night wearing clothing, since he does not get dressed in the morning, does not recite <em>Malbish arumim</em>. A handicapped person who
cannot walk does not recite <em>Hamechin mitzadei gaver</em>. A paralyzed person, who cannot move his limbs, does not recite <em>Matir assurim</em> and    <em>Zokef kefufim</em>. Some people of Yemenite descent follow the <em>Rambam</em>'s opinion today. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>Orach Chaim</em> 46:8)
    takes this opinion into consideration and rules that one does not mention Hashem's Name when reciting blessings from which he does not derive pleasure.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
By contrast, the <em>Kolbo</em> (section 1) writes in the names of Rav Natrunai Gaon, Rav Amram Gaon, and the remaining <em>Geonim</em>, that the    <em>minhag</em> is to recite all <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> in order, whether or not one derives pleasure from them, because they were instituted based on
    the general pleasures of the world. Furthermore, the fact that others derive pleasure from something can be indirectly useful for someone who does not
    directly derive pleasure from it. Therefore, even a paralyzed person who cannot straighten himself, blesses Hashem for all the other people who can
    straighten themselves and help him. A blind person also recites <em>Poke'ach ivrim</em> for the fact that others are able to see and can therefore show him
    the way and tend to all his needs. This is how the <em>Rama</em> rules.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Likewise, the opinion of the <em>Ari HaKadosh</em> is that every Jew must recite all of the <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> in their order to thank Hashem for
all the general good that He showers on the world. In many <em>minhagim</em> regarding prayer, the <em>Sephardim</em> have the custom to follow the    <em>Ari</em>, and therefore they recite all <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> in order.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    4. Until When May One Recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>?
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
Whoever forgot to recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> before the prayer service may recite them afterwards, with the exception of the blessing<em> Al netilat yadayim</em>, which may not be recited after praying because it was instituted as a preparation for prayer. Similarly, he may not recite    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> since he already fulfilled his obligation by saying <em>Ahavat Olam.</em> Also, he may not recite <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>, since
there are those who say that he already fulfilled his obligation to recite <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> when he recited <em>Birkat</em>    <em>Mechayei hameitim</em> in the <em>Amidah</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Therefore, one who must skip <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em> on time should at least recite <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>,    <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>, and <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> first, because if he does not recite them first, he will not be able to make them up after the prayer
    service (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:2).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Until when may he recite them? Since there are those who equate the time to recite the <em>berachot</em> to the time of the <em>Amidah</em>,    <em>l'chatchilah</em> he should try to recite them before the first four hours of the day have passed, and <em>b'dieved</em> until <em>chatzot</em>
    (halachic noon). However, if he did not succeed in saying them before <em>chatzot</em>, <em>b'dieved</em> he may recite them the whole day. The reason for
    this is that according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, the time to say the <em>berachot</em> differs from the time to recite <em>Shacharit</em>,
because <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> are blessings of thanks for the good things from which people derive pleasure throughout the day.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>

<a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    5. The Time to Recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> for One Who Wakes Up in the Middle of the Night
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
, all the blessings should be recited as close as possible to the time one wakes from his sleep and it is not necessary to say them specifically after<em>alot hashachar</em>. Therefore, one who gets up before <em>alot hashachar</em> in order to learn Torah, to work, or for any other purpose, must recite    <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> immediately upon waking up. However, <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> may not be recited before <em>chatzot</em> (halachic midnight).
    Therefore, a person who wakes up before <em>chatzot</em> must wait until after <em>chatzot</em> to recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. If he recites them
before that time, he does not fulfill his obligation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:31; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 29).    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who wakes up after <em>chatzot</em> for a few hours and plans on returning to sleep until the time to recite <em>Shacharit</em>, such as a soldier who
    gets up after <em>chatzot</em> for guard duty and goes back to sleep, must say <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> after his main waking. If, in his opinion, his
    initial waking is his main one, and he considers any sleep after that similar to a nap in the middle of the day, he must recite them after the first sleep.
    If his second rising is his main one, he must recite them after the second rising. However, the kabbalistic custom is that as long as the first rising is
    after <em>chatzot</em>, he must say <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> after the first rising. If he did not say them after the first rising, then he must say them
    after the second.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> that the law regarding <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is similar to the ruling for blessings recited upon the
    performance of <em>mitzvot.</em> Therefore one must recite them every time he wakes up from a regular sleep at night. Still, there are those who have the
    custom to recite them only after the first rising (see the laws of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> further in this book 10:6).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    6. One Who Was Awake All Night
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    As a general rule, even a person who did not sleep all night recites <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. As we learned (in halachah 3), these <em>berachot</em> were
instituted on the basis of general benefit, and therefore, even if one does not personally derive pleasure from something, he still recites a    <em>berachah</em> on it. However, there is a difference in <em>minhag</em> regarding a number of <em>berachot</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Concerning washing one's hands, it is agreed that a person needs to wash his hands before praying. However, the <em>poskim</em> differ regarding whether or
    not to recite a <em>berachah</em> on this washing. According to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (4:30), before praying, it is best relieve oneself and touch a
part of the body which is normally covered, thereby necessitating the washing of one's hands with a <em>berachah</em>. However, in any case, the Sephardic    <em>minhag</em> is not to say a <em>berachah</em> on this washing (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:49, and see above 8:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, regarding <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, there is a dispute as to whether or not one is obligated to repeat these <em>berachot</em> with the dawn of a
    new day. Therefore it is best to hear the <em>berachot</em> recited by someone who slept, with the intention to fulfill the obligation by hearing them. If
    one cannot find another person around him who can recite the <em>berachot</em> for him to hear, some <em>poskim</em> rule that one may recite them by
    himself. Such is the custom of <em>Sephardim</em> and some <em>Ashkenazim</em>. There are others who rule that one should have in mind to fulfill his
    obligation in <em>Ahavah Rabbah</em>, and that is how most <em>Ashkenazim</em> practice (see the laws of<em> Birkot HaTorah</em> further in this book
    10:7).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is also doubt concerning <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> and <em>Hama'avir sheinah</em>, since some say that only one who has slept may recite them. In
    order to avoid uncertainty, it is best to hear these <em>berachot</em> being recited by someone who slept, and in doing so fulfill his obligation. If there
is no one around to recite them, according to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em> and some Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em>, one may recite them himself, although the    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> maintains that he should not.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    <strong>In summary: according to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em> and some <em>Ashkenazim</em>,</strong>
one recites all the <em>berachot</em>, with the exception of <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>, and it is best to hear another person recite<em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>, and <em>Hama'avir sheinah.</em>    <strong>According to the majority of the <em>Ashkenazim</em>, based on the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, </strong>one first goes to the bathroom and then
    recites <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>. Concerning <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>, and <em>Hama'avir sheinah</em>, one should hear another
    person recite them. If there is no one else there who needs to say these <em>berachot</em>, a person may not recite them on his own; rather he should have
    in mind to fulfill his obligation of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in <em>Ahavah Rabbah.</em><button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button> <strong></strong>

            There is a dispute among the <em>poskim</em> regarding whether the <em>berachah</em> <em>She'asah li kol tzorki</em>, normally said on footwear, is
recited on Yom Kippur and Tishah B'Av, days on which it is prohibited to wear shoes. According to the <em>Rosh</em>, <em>Ran</em>, and the            <em>Tur</em>, it is recited. That is also what the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes in 554:31, based on the <em>Levush</em>, <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>,
            and <em>Pri Megadim</em>. That is how the <em>Ashkenazim</em> and a few <em>Sephardim</em> practice; see <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 1, p. 51.
            However, according to the <em>Ari</em>, even though a mourner does recite <em>She'asah li kol tzorki</em>, it is not recited on those days, as is
written by the <em>Chida</em>, <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 46:17. <em>Rav Pe'alim</em> 2:8 writes that according to this            <em>minhag</em>, even at the end of the fast it is not recited. (However, in <em>Ma'asei Rav</em> 9 it is written that the <em>Gra</em> was
            accustomed to reciting it at the conclusion of the fast).

            For a more extensive outline of the laws of<em> Birkot HaTorah</em>, see further in this book, 10:2 and note 2. Concerning <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>
            , the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:9 and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> write that the <em>Pri Chadash</em> maintains that one fulfills his obligation by
reciting <em>Birkat</em> <em>Mechayei hameitim</em>. The <em>Chayei Adam</em> and <em>Derech HaChaim</em> quote him. However,            <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> disagrees with him. That is also what the <em>Pri Megadim</em> understands from the <em>Rama</em>'s words, and what we
            can infer from the <em>Gra</em>'s writings. In any case, in order to avoid uncertainty, one who skips <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> in order to pray in
a <em>minyan</em> should first recite <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>. If he did not recite it, he may not recite it after the prayer service, for<em>safek berachot l'hakel</em>, (when there is doubt regarding the recital of <em>berachot</em> we are lenient). However, the            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> writes that one may rely on all of the <em>poskim</em> who maintain that one may recite <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> after the
prayer service. Further, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes that if he explicitly has <em>kavanah</em> in <em>Birkat</em>            <em>Mechayei hameitim</em> not to fulfill his obligation for saying <em>Elokai Neshamah</em>, he does not fulfill it and he may recite it after the
            prayer service. However, the <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 4:5, in the footnote, writes that this <em>kavanah</em> does not help. According to this, if,
in the middle of saying <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, he remembers that he did not recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, he should recite            <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> even between the <em>berachot</em>, so as not to miss out on saying it altogether (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 46:23-24).
        </p>

    <div id="ftn3">
        <p dir="LTR">
            <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
The <em>Derech HaChaim</em>, based on the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, writes that the laws of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> are equal to the laws of the<em>Amidah</em>, and just as the time of the <em>Amidah</em> lasts four proportional hours, which is a third of the day, so does the time to recite            <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. There are those who maintain that just as <em>b'dieved</em> one may recite <em>Shacharit </em>until <em>chatzot</em>
(halachic noon), the same is true for <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> (Rabbi Shlomo Kluger). <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 71:4 writes that if one already prayed            <em>Shacharit</em> he may recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> within the first four hours of the day, and if he did not yet pray <em>Shacharit</em>,
            he may recite them until <em>chatzot</em>. However, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> are not directly linked
to prayer, and one who forgets to recite them in the morning may recite them the entire day, and that is what is written in            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:10 and <em>Rav Pe'alim</em> 2, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 8. (According to the <em>Gra</em>, if one forgot to recite them
            during the day, he may say them even at night until he goes to sleep. The <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 46:25 writes that one who practices this way has on
            whom to rely.)

Regarding the <em>berachah</em>, <em>Hanoten lasechvi vinah</em>, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 47:13 writes, based on the <em>Rosh</em> and the<em>Tur</em>, that he must wait until the light of day begins to appear in order to recite it. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:31 and<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> write that the <em>Acharonim</em> (<em>Magen Avraham</em> in the name of the <em>Zohar</em>, <em>Pri Chadash</em>, and the<em>Gra</em>) agree that even this <em>berachah</em> may be recited before daylight arrives. However, the <em>Chayei Adam</em> writes that<em>l'chatchilah</em> if one recites it before daylight, he should be careful not to recite it before he actually hears a rooster crow. The            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> concludes that <em>b'dieved</em> one fulfills his obligation even if he recites it before hearing a rooster crow, as long
            as he recited it after <em>chatzot</em>. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 30 writes in the name of the <em>Pri Chadash</em> and the <em>Chida</em> that
            according to the halachah and the <em>Zohar</em>, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, one may recite it after <em>chatzot</em>. That is what I wrote above,
since <em>b'dieved</em> everyone agrees that he fulfills his obligation. There is also concern that if one divides the recital of            <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, he will forget to recite a certain <em>berachah</em> afterwards.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="ftn5">
        <p dir="LTR">
            <a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>
            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:30 writes that if the first time he wakes up is after <em>chatzot</em>, he may recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. He
            did not specify whether it is preferable to recite them particularly after the first rising. However, the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 46:49 writes based
            on the Kabbalah, that it is best to recite them following the first waking after <em>chatzot</em>. One who cannot determine which rising is
            considered his main one should practice according to the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> and recite them after the first rising.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Further, it is important to note that <strong>according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em></strong> 47:30, the <em>berachot</em>,<strong><em>Elokai Neshamah</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hama'avir sheinah me'einai</em></strong> are to be recited after the first rising without<em>Shem u'Malchut</em> (Hashem's name), and the second time he recites them with <em>Shem u'Malchut</em>. However, if he recited them with            <em>Shem u'Malchut</em> the first time, he may not go back and repeat them a second time. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> expands on this, saying that
            according to the <em>Pri Chadash</em> they must be recited only after he finishes sleeping that night. If he recites them the first time he wakes
            up, he does not fulfill his obligation, and he must go back and recite them after the second time he wakes up. The <em>Chayei Adam</em> agrees with
            him concerning <em>Hama'avir sheinah</em>. However, <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em> and<em> Derech HaChaim</em> write not to repeat it after waking up
the second time. Therefore, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> rules that if a person already recited them, he may not go back and say them again.            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 46:49 writes in the name of a number of <em>poskim</em> and kabbalists that even these two <em>berachot</em> need to be
recited the first time with <em>Shem u'Malchut</em> and any sleep after that is considered similar to a nap taken during the day. That is how            <em>Sephardim</em> practice. The <em>Ashkenazim</em> follow the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, yet, even according to him, if they recited the blessing
the first time, they fulfilled their obligation. In my humble opinion, it seems that it is better to teach both <em>Ashkenazim</em> and            <em>Sepharadim</em> to recite all the <em>berachot</em> after the main waking, because when one recites most of the <em>berachot</em> with the
            first rising and leaves two <em>berachot</em> for the second rising, there is concern that he will make a mistake, either by forgetting to say the
            last two <em>berachot</em>, or by accidentally reciting all the <em>berachot</em> again the second time he wakes up. Therefore, I concluded above
to recite all of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> after the main waking and even when the first waking is the main one, a person who recites            <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> and <em>Hama'avir sheinah</em> at that point has on whom to rely.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
According to the kabbalists, the best time to recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> for one who was awake all night is after <em>chatzot</em>, and            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> after <em>alot hashachar</em>. However, the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 14, writes concerning someone who goes
            to sleep after <em>chatzot</em>, that although according to the <em>Rashash</em> he may recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> after <em>chatzot</em>
            before he goes to sleep, the custom is to recite them after one wakes up, as <em>Rav Eliyahu</em> writes in his <em>siddur</em>, p. 3.

            The Sephardic <em>minhag</em>, based on the <em>Ari</em>, is explained in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 46:49. The <em>Kaf HaChaim </em>also writes that
according to the Kabbalah, <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> should be recited immediately after <em>chatzot</em>; however, one must be careful to recite            <em>Birkot HaTorah </em>only after <em>alot hashachar</em>. See further in this book, chapter 10, note 8.

The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 46:24 writes that according to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, one who did not sleep should not recite            <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> and <em>Hama'avir sheinah</em>. The <em>Pri Megadim</em> and the <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em> indicate that this matter
            requires further study. The <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em> concludes that one should fulfill his obligation by hearing them recited from another
person. This implies that if there is no one he can listen to recite the <em>berachot</em> he may not recite them due to doubt. Still, the            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 46:13 writes that according to the <em>Rama</em> one may recite the <em>berachot</em>. An <em>Ashkenazi</em> who follows
that custom has on whom to rely (and perhaps in order to limit disagreement, the ruling should be according to them). Regarding            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, see the laws of<em> Birkot HaTorah</em> further in this book 10:7, where the opinions and customs are clarified.
