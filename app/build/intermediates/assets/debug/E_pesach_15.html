Chapter Fifteen: The Hagada
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. "Tell Your Child"
</h2>
<p>
    There is a positive mitzva to tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan. The more one embellishes the telling,
    elucidates the great kindness God showed us by saving us from the Egyptians and avenging us upon them, interprets the signs and wonders that God performed
    at that time and place for our sake, delves into the laws of Pesah, and gives expansive gratitude to God - the more commendable it is.<em> </em>The essence
    of the mitzva is to tell the children, as it is stated: "Tell your child on that day: 'It is because of this that God did for me when I left Egypt'"
    (Shemot 13:8). Even one who is childless is commanded by the Torah to recall the Exodus on Pesah night, as it states: "Remember this day on which you came
    out of Egypt, of the house of bondage; how, with a mighty hand, God took you out of there" (<em>ibid</em>. 3).
</p>
<p>
    Note that two <em>mitzvot </em>require us to educate our children: the first is to teach them the written and oral Torah, so they understand the world
properly and may live their lives according to divine guidance. Part of this mitzva is to habituate and familiarize children with the observance of    <em>mitzvot</em>; it is impossible to teach about Shabbat or <em>kashrut </em>without training for their observance. The second mitzva is to tell our
    children about the Exodus from Egypt on the Seder night.
</p>
<p>
    At first glance, this is puzzling. Is narrating the Exodus not part of the general mitzva of teaching Torah? In that case, what is different about the
    Seder night? The purpose of the stories told to the children on Seder night is to convey the fundamentals of faith that logically precede Torah study: they
    must know how the nation of Israel was formed, that God chose Israel to be His special nation, and that He gave them a special duty to receive the Torah
    and rectify the world. Parents, of course, do not live forever. The next generation will have to bear the torch of tradition, the great and awesome task
    that God intended for Israel, until the world has been fully repaired. This is the lesson of the Seder night. All of its <em>mitzvot </em>lead to that end.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the obligation to study Torah is derived from the verse: "Teach them to your children<em>,</em> to speak of them" (Devarim 11:19). The Sages
    explain that one who must teach his son Torah must himself study Torah (<em>Kiddushin</em> 29b). The fundamental goal of the Torah is to positively
    influence others and add life to the world, not just to elevate the individual Jew. Therefore, the Torah emphasizes in this commandment the obligation to
    teach the children, for the essential goal of the Torah is to influence the entire people of Israel in every generation. Clearly, then, every individual is
    likewise commanded to study Torah as much as he is able. What is more, when one studies in order to teach others, his study is more thorough and profound.
    Similarly, the primary emphasis of the mitzva to tell the story of the Exodus is to pass the tradition on to the children, but it follows that the parents
    should also attempt to understand it more profoundly, so that they are worthy of Israel's great destiny.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
2. The Mitzva to Tell the Exodus Story on Pesah Night    
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah commands us to tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt on the very night we left Egypt for freedom. Actually, we are commanded to remember the
    Exodus every day of the year, as it states: "So that you remember the day you left Egypt every day of your life" (Devarim 16:3). Ben Zoma infers from an
    apparent superfluity in this verse ("<em>kol yemei</em>" instead of "<em>yemei</em>")<em> </em>that we must invoke the Exodus not only every day, but also
even every night (<em>Berakhot</em> 12b). To fulfill the obligation to invoke the Exodus every day and night, we recite the third paragraph of    <em>Shema </em>each morning and evening, as this paragraph states: "I am the Lord your God Who has taken you out of Egypt to be your God: I am the Lord
    your God" (Bamidbar 15:41).
</p>
<p>
    Yet there are several differences between the daily mitzva and the mitzva on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan. Firstly, in order to fulfill the daily
    mitzva, it is sufficient to mention the Exodus, whereas the mitzva on Pesah night is to narrate broadly the events of the Exodus from Egypt. In addition,
the mitzva on Pesah night is to relate the story while the matza and <em>maror</em> are set out in front of us. Another difference is that on Pesah    <em> </em>night we tell the story by way of questions and answers. Women are exempt from the daily mitzva to commemorate the Exodus, but are obligated to
    tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan.

</p>
<p>
    The Exodus from Egypt is the basis of Jewish faith, for it was the first time that God's providence was revealed in the world to an entire nation with
    great signs and wonders. With the Exodus, it became clear that God had chosen Israel to be His nation and to reveal His word in the world. For this reason,
    every Shabbat and Yom Tov commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, especially in prayers and <em>kiddush</em>. By virtue of the unique mitzva to tell the story
    of the Exodus in depth on the Seder night, our faith becomes more firmly established, and added meaning is given to all the brief remembrances of the
    Exodus throughout the year.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. The Mitzva to Begin the Seder with a Question
</h2>
<p>
    There is a mitzva to tell the story of the Exodus by way of question and answer, as it is stated: "When in the future your child asks you... say to your
    child, 'We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt...'" (Devarim 6:20-22). It is likewise stated: "When your children ask you, 'What is this service to you?' say,
    'It is a Paschal sacrifice to God'" (Shemot 12:26-27). And: "When in the future your child asks: 'What is this?' Say to him, 'With a mighty hand God took
    us out of Egypt'" (<em>ibid</em>. 13:14).
</p>
<p>
    Questions open the heart and mind to accept answers. The message we need to convey on the Seder night is so important and fundamental that we are commanded
    to do it in the most effective way - by way of question and answer.
</p>
<p>
    This is the main reason for the unique <em>mitzvot</em> of the Seder night: eating matza, the Paschal sacrifice, and <em>maror</em>. They cause the
    children to ask "<em>Ma nishtana</em>?" "Why is this night different?" and helps them understand that this is a special night whose essence must be
    understood. As a result, the Sages instituted several unusual practices in order to inspire children to wonder and enquire further. We begin by giving the
children nuts and roasted grain, through which they realize that this is a special, festive night. The Sages instituted washing hands and eating    <em>karpas</em> dipped in a liquid after <em>kiddush</em>, something we never do throughout the year. Furthermore, instead of starting the meal at this
    point, we pour the second cup of wine and remove the Seder plate and the <em>matzot</em> from the table, all to cause the children to realize that this is
    a very special night. They will thus truly be interested in its meaning, and they will sincerely ask: "Why is this night different?"<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    It can be said that this question, "<em>Ma nishtana</em>?" embodies a bigger and deeper question about the Jewish people: Why are we different from all
    other nations - in our faith, in our <em>mitzvot</em>, in our suffering, in our spiritual achievements, in our exile, and in our redemption? There is no
    complete answer to this question. Only by contemplating the Exodus from Egypt and the election of Israel can we understand that this is a divine matter; we
    are capable of understanding part of it, but we will never understand it all. This same question spurs us on, toward infinitely deeper and more sublime
    understanding. Perhaps this is why the Torah instructs us to tell the story of the Exodus and of Israel's singularity using questions and answers: the
    ideological basis of Jewish peoplehood lies in a question that opens us to an endless profusion of ideas. If we do not impart the Torah and the story of
    the Exodus to the children, no new questions would be asked and we would be unable to continue rising higher.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. The Text of "<em>Ma Nishtana</em>"   
</h2>
<p>
    In order to give this seminal question a structured framework, the Sages formulated the "<em>Ma nishtana</em>"<em> </em>text, through which the children
    express their surprise at how different this night is, paving the way for the telling of the Exodus story. The text contains questions about all of the
    Seder night <em>mitzvot</em> related to eating: matza, <em>maror</em>, the Paschal sacrifice, and the two dippings. After the destruction of the Temple, we
    no longer ask about the Paschal sacrifice and instead ask about reclining at the Seder.
</p>
<p>
    If there are no children present to ask "<em>Ma nishtana</em>?" the youngest participant asks. Even if all the participants are Torah scholars well versed
in the story of the Exodus, one of them must ask "<em>Ma nishtana</em>?" Even an individual performing the Seder alone must begin with "    <em>Ma nishtana</em>?" This is how the Seder is arranged; we begin with a question because it makes the explanation more complete. Once a child or someone
    else has asked "<em>Ma nishtana</em>?" the other participants need not repeat the question and may proceed immediately to "<em>Avadim</em> <em>Hayinu</em>"
    (SA and Rema 473:7).

<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. The Torah Speaks of Four Children    
</h2>
<p>
    On four occasions the Torah states that one must tell his child about the Exodus from Egypt, and each time it uses a different formulation. This teaches us
    that one must tailor his storytelling to the abilities and personality of each child.
</p>
<p>
    In one place it states: "When in the future your child asks you, 'What are these testimonies, laws, and principles that the Lord our God commanded you?'"
    (Devarim 6:20). The fact that he asks in a detailed manner - "What are these testimonies, laws, and principles" - implies that we are dealing with a wise
    child, and the verses that follow teach us that the answer we give must be detailed. We must clarify at length the whole matter of the Exodus from Egypt,
    the <em>mitzvot </em>of Pesah, and the destiny of the Jewish people. Therefore, the answer for the wise child is the longest and most detailed (as shown in
    the next section).
</p>
<p>
    Elsewhere it states: "When your children ask you, 'What is this service to you?,' say, 'It is a Paschal sacrifice to God, Who passed over ('<em>pasah</em>
')<em> </em>the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when He smote Egypt and spared our homes<em>' </em>" (Shemot 12:26-27). Since the child calls the    <em>mitzvot</em> "service" ("<em>avoda</em>"), which connotes "work," and since he excludes himself from the <em>mitzvot</em>, saying, "What is this
    service to you?," it is clear that he does not feel like a participant in the <em>mitzvot</em>. Nevertheless, the Torah commands us to
    address him and explain to him Israel's uniqueness, as expressed in the Paschal sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
    It also states: "When in the future your child asks: 'What is this?,' say to him, 'With a mighty hand God took us out of Egypt, out of the house of
    bondage. When Pharaoh refused to free us, God killed every firstborn in Egypt, human and beast alike'" (Shemot 13:14-15). The question "What is this?"
    indicates that the asker is simple and does not know how to sharpen his question. The Torah commands us to explain to him, according to his abilities, the
    impressive events that took place during the Exodus from Egypt, the mighty plagues that struck the Egyptians, and the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, which
    was finally softened by the Plague of the Firstborn. These are things the simple child absorbs and finds most impressive.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Even if the child is not moved to ask at all, one must tell him about the Exodus, as it states: ""<em>Matzot </em>are to be eaten... Tell your child on that
    day: 'It is because of this that God did for me when I left Egypt'" (Shemot 13:7-8). Since he does not ask any questions, his interest must be aroused with
    tangible objects. We therefore say to him, "It is because of this" - by virtue of the <em>matzot</em>, <em>maror</em>, and Paschal sacrifice God performed
    miracles for us and took us out of Egypt. Thus, we put the Seder plate on the table so that each food on it can illustrate one of the ideas that find
    expression at the Seder.

<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. The Main Message of the Hagada
</h2>
<p>
    In order to understand fully the goal of the Hagada and the story of the Exodus from Egypt, we must consider the question of the wise child and the answer
    he receives, for he is the preferred child, and we pray that all our children develop and succeed in becoming wise.
</p>
<p>
    The wise child poses a detailed question, as it is stated: "When in the future your child asks you, 'What are these testimonies, laws, and principles that
    the Lord our God commanded you?'" (Devarim 6:20). The answer initially addresses the Exodus from Egypt but then broadens to include the overall purpose of
    the Jewish people: to come to Eretz Yisrael, to adhere to God, to fulfill all of His <em>mitzvot</em>, and to earn His benevolence:
</p>
<p>
    Say to your child, "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but God took us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. God brought great and terrible miracles and
    demonstrations upon Egypt, Pharaoh, and his entire household before our very eyes. He brought us out of there in order to bring us to, and give us, the
    land He promised to our forebears. God commanded us to keep all of these laws, to fear the Lord our God, for the sake of our everlasting benefit, so that
    He might sustains us as we are today. And it shall be considered our virtue to observe and perform all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He
    commanded us. (<em>ibid. </em>6:21-25)
</p>
<p>
    We see, then, that the aim of the Seder is to impart to our children, by telling the story of the Exodus, the desire to belong to the people of Israel, to
    inherit the Promised Land, to adhere to God, and to perform all of His <em>mitzvot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    To enable us to tell the story of the Exodus to the wise child without leaving out any of its essential components, the Men of the Great Assembly, who
    lived at the beginning of the Second Temple period, composed the text of the Hagada. Over time, the leading Tanna'im, Amora 'im, and Ge'onim added passages
    containing important elements related to the <em>mitzvot</em> of the Hagada. Finally, about 800 years ago, a consensus version was accepted by all Jewish
    communities, based on the text of R. Amram Gaon.
</p>
<p>
    The text of the Hagada<em> </em>is thus the complete story, and whoever recites it covers all aspects of the Exodus from Egypt. Nonetheless, the more one
    explains the Hagada and expands upon it with illuminating ideas, stories, and laws related to Pesah and the Exodus, the more commendable it is.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. From Indignity to Praise   
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages state that one must begin the story of the Exodus with indignity ("<em>genut</em>") and end it with praise ("<em>shevah</em>"). To what sort of
    "indignity" does this refer, physical or spiritual? According to one talmudic sage (Shmuel), it refers to physical indignity - the fact that we were slaves
    to Pharaoh in Egypt, that the Egyptians embittered our lives with all manner of hard labor, until God redeemed us from their oppression. Another sage (Rav)
    maintains that this refers to spiritual indignity - the fact that our distant ancestors, Terah and Lavan, were pagans, and through a long process of
    refinement we became an entire nation of monotheists. In practice, we follow both approaches, recounting in the Hagada the process of our emergence from
enslavement to freedom as well as the process that took us from idolatry to the point when God revealed Himself to us, and we achieved complete faith (    <em>Pesahim</em> 116a).
</p>
<p>
    At first glance, it might seem preferable to tell only the pleasant and agreeable stories. A deeper second glance, however, makes it clear that the more we
    contemplate the hardships of the enslavement and the ignominy of the paganism practiced by our forefathers, the better we can grasp the enormity of our
    redemption. Light is more discernible in the midst of darkness.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, discussing our undignified beginnings allows us to better understand that Israel's uniqueness is not contingent upon our success or good
    deeds, but is rooted in divine election that lies beyond all human comprehension. f Though we lacked all dignity as contemptible slaves, God chose us from
    all other nations and took us out of Egypt with signs and demonstrations. Despite the fact that our forefathers were idolaters, God chose to reveal Himself
    to us and give us the Torah. Thus, Israel's special status is not contingent on anything of this world, but on Divine fiat.
</p>
<p>
    This can also teach us about Israel's unique ability to bring redemption to the world, to turn darkness into light and evil into good. We start the story
    by emphasizing our former indignity, to show that from the ignorance of paganism and servitude we rose up and achieved great things. This is an encouraging
    and comforting message: as then, so too now - our redemption will emerge from the suffering and travails of recent generations.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, discussing the fact that we were ignoble slaves awakens our sensitivity and consideration for strangers and for the unfortunate who suffer
    and need help, as it is stated: "Do not oppress the stranger, for you know how it feels to be a stranger, since you were strangers in the land of Egypt"
    (Shemot 23:9).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. The Meaning of the Ten Plagues
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah describes the ten plagues at length and in great detail, without omitting a single plague. There are many things we can learn from this. The most
    obvious is that there is a Judge and there is justice, and the wicked eventually will be punished. Those who are especially wicked, like the Egyptians, who
    enslaved an entire nation, imposed backbreaking labor, and drowned their male children in the Nile, deserved to receive their full punishment, so that all
    generations might learn this lesson.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
There is also a profound allusion here. As we know, the world was created with ten divine utterances (<em>Rosh</em> <em>Hashana</em> 32a).    <em>Kabbala </em>interprets these as ten <em>sefirot</em>, or "emanations," with which God created the world and continues to maintain and sustain it.
    However, until the nation of Israel emerged, these <em>sefirot</em> were concealed and hidden. Just as these ten spiritual elements were hidden, so too the
    Israelites, before they matured enough to emerge as a nation, were enslaved in Egypt.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    When Israel finally reached maturity, numbering 600,000 (see above 1:4), the time had come for them to go free. It was then that God commanded Moshe to go
    to Pharaoh and order him to "free My people so they may make a pilgrimage to Me in the wilderness." Moshe did so, but Pharaoh refused to free them, saying,
    "Who is<em> </em>God that I should heed His<em> </em>call to free Israel<em>. </em>I do not know God and I will not free Israel" (Shemot 5:1-2). Pharaoh
    stubbornly refused God's command many times. But God's will prevails and no man can stand up to God's word, not even the leader of the strongest empire in
    the world. Using the same elements He used to create the world, God rocked the Egyptian empire with plague after plague, so that the ten utterances of
    Creation took the form of ten plagues, until the Egyptians were completely broken, and Israel went free.
</p>
<p>
    When we arrived at Mount Sinai, God revealed the meaning of those same ten utterances in the Ten Commandments, the Torah's foundation.
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
9. Pesah, Matza, and <em>Maror</em>    
</h2>
<p>
    The Mishna teaches: "Rabban Gamliel would say: 'Whoever does not say these three things on Pesah has not fulfilled his obligation, and they are: Pesah,
    matza, and <em>maror</em>'" (<em>Pesahim</em> 126a).<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    This means that even one who cannot recite the entire Hagada must at least delve into the three food-related <em>mitzvot</em> of the Seder night. The Torah
    thus states regarding the mitzva to teach the child who does not know how to ask: "Tell your child on that day: 'It is because of this that God did for me
when I left Egypt'" (Shemot 13:8), and the Sages teach: "'because of this' means when matza and <em>maror</em> are before you on your table" (    <em>Mekhilta</em> <em>Bo</em> 17). This teaches that one must at least reflect upon the reasons for the three foods we have been commanded to eat on the
    Seder night. Even though we are unable to offer the Paschal sacrifice nowadays, we are nonetheless commanded to recall its meaning.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Because, as we have seen, the Seder is conducted in question and answer form, we recite: "The Pesah [sacrifice] that our ancestors would eat when the
    Temple still stood, what is it for?"; "This matza that we eat, what is it for?"; and "This <em>maror</em> that we eat, what is it for?"
</p>
<p>
    The Paschal offering expresses Israel's special relationship with God, matza expresses freedom, and <em>maror</em> expresses the significance of the
    enslavement.
</p>
<p>
    The Paschal offering expresses Israel's special relationship with God because it recalls God's miraculous differentiation between Israel and other nations,
    slaying the Egyptian firstborn while "passing over" the homes of the Israelites. One might say that Israel's special status is not obvious to all as long
    as the Temple lies in ruins, and so we cannot offer the Paschal sacrifice nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    The matza, though, which expresses our redemption from Egypt, is a perpetual mitzva, as we have never lost the freedom we obtained when we left Egypt and
    became wholly attached to God. This is true freedom, because only one who occupies himself with Torah is truly free. Even when we are enslaved among the
    nations, our spirit remains free, for the Torah allows us to transcend material enslavement.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Maror </em>
is a mitzva of rabbinic origin during periods when the Temple is in ruins and the Paschal sacrifice cannot be offered. Perhaps this is because    <em>maror</em> alludes to the pain and bitterness of the enslavement, and we cannot yet fully grasp the meaning of our suffering. Only when we are able to
    offer the Paschal sacrifice will we grasp the full meaning of our suffering; only when we can see how it refines and purifies us and understand how our
    salvation sprouted from within all the difficult times does the mitzva to eat <em>maror </em>become <em>de-Oraita</em>.<em> </em>Until then, we have faith
    that everything is for the best.

            level. <em>Sefer Ha-hinukh</em> �21 infers from the fact that women are obligated in matza and the Paschal offering on the Torah level that they
are obligated by the Torah to tell the Exodus story, which is linked to the matza, <em>maror</em>, and Paschal offering, as well. Other            <em>poskim</em> maintain that since the mitzva of telling the story is a time-bound positive mitzva, women are exempt according to the Torah, but
            the Sages obligated them in the <em>mitzvot</em><em> </em>of the Seder night, since women also experienced the miracles of the Exodus. This is the

            . According to several Rishonim, including <em>Rokei'ah</em> and Maharil, if a child asks any question about the Seder, the obligation to ask
questions has been fulfilled, and there is no need to recite the "<em>Ma nishtana</em>" formula specifically. However, according to most Rishonim<em>,</em> including <em>Tosafot</em> and Rambam, even if a child autonomously asks a question relating to the Seder, the entire "            <em>Ma nishtana</em>" formula must be recited. The <em>halakha</em> follows this opinion. See <em>Birur Halakha </em>on <em>Pesahim </em>115b (p.
            134) for a summary of opinions. This ruling notwithstanding, one should encourage his children to ask their own questions, to fulfill the verse
            "when your child asks..."
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            One authority writes that the mitzva <em>de-Oraita </em>to tell the Exodus story only applies when a child actually asks a question, but if the
            child does not inquire, the biblical mitzva is only to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt, though one is still rabbinically required to tell the
            story. This is the implication of <em>Responsa Rosh </em>24:2, but the majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that anyone who has a child is
            obligated by the Torah to tell him the story, as the Torah states regarding the son who does not know how to ask, "Tell your child on this day: 'It
            is because of this that God did for me when I left Egypt'" (Shemot 13:8). So states SAH 473:42. (R. Yeruham Fishel Perla, in his commentary on R.
            Saadia Gaon's <em>Sefer Ha-mitzvot </em>�32, states that according to Ramban and other Rishonim<em>,</em> one who does not have matza is exempt
            from the mitzva of telling the story of the Exodus, based on the phrase "because of this" ["<em>ba-avur zeh</em>" - the Hebrew uses the
            demonstrative pronoun "<em>zeh</em>" instead of the expected indefinite relative pronoun, indicating that it refers to an object that is present,
            i.e., the matza]. Additionally, see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato </em>ch. 6 n. 2 which mentions a distinction between a child who asks his father a
            question, which obligates his father to tell the story in detail, and a child who does not ask, which only obligates the father to tell the story
            briefly. We can explain that if the son asks, the father must embellish his response based on the question, but if the child does not ask, the
            father need only tell the story briefly. Embellishment depends on the child's desire to listen and obtain answers.) In any event, it is clear that
at least on the rabbinic level one must recite the entire Hagada<em> </em>as formulated. Even if he is alone, he asks himself the questions (            <em>Pesahim </em>116a) and thus extends to himself the obligation to answer.

            . It is interesting to note that the answer given to the wicked child is taken from Shemot 12, in the context of the mitzva of the Pesah sacrifice
            both in Egypt and for future generations. Sacrificing an animal and sprinkling its blood raise the biggest questions for him. Nevertheless, the
            answer to his question is not evasive. It addresses the uniqueness of the Jewish people, a topic whose roots are beyond human comprehension and
            whose branches appear throughout the course of history. The response to the child who does not know how to ask comes from Shemot<em> </em>13:8
            following the commandment to eat the Pesah sacrifice. While partaking in actual eating of the matza, one can try to connect him to the memory of
            the Exodus until he develops greater understanding (the child who does not know how to ask is not stupid, merely uninterested). The response to the
            simple son is written in the context of the sanctity of firstborns. Because he is not very intelligent, his father must teach him fear of heaven
            and respect for sanctity. This is accomplished by contemplating God's power and the Plague of the Firstborn. As a result, this child will accept
            the <em>mitzvot</em>, whose goal is to sanctify us and distinguish us from all other nations. The question of the wise son is not mentioned
            specifically in the context of Pesah; rather, it is mentioned in Devarim 6 regarding the foundations of belief and the destiny of the Jewish
            people. Since everything stems from the Exodus, the Sages understood that the wise child's question is related to the <em>mitzvot</em> of Pesah.
            Through that we explain to the wise son all the basic principles of faith.

            . In this sense, the entire text of the Hagada is the complete answer to the wise child. However, in the Hagada itself the wise child is answered
            simply: "after the Paschal sacrifice, we do not conclude with dessert (<em>afikoman</em>)<em>.</em>" The Hagada means to say that we teach the wise
            son all of the laws of Pesah until the very last one, namely, that we do not eat anything after the consumption of the <em>afikoman. </em>
            (Originally, the sacrifice was the last thing eaten at the Seder; we now eat matza - the <em>afikoman </em>- instead.) This law highlights how
            beloved the Seder is: we do not want to eat anything after the <em>afikoman</em>, so that the taste of the mitzva remains in our mouths. It also
            seems that the wise child has a tendency to discuss and attend to peripheral issues. On the Seder night, the goal is to understand the larger
            principles in all their profound simplicity. Thus, we say to him: "Do not go for dessert after eating the Paschal sacrifice. Focus on the main
            thing, without going off on tangents."

Some had the custom of reciting the <em>berakha</em> "<em>al sipur yetzi'at Mitzrayim</em>" ("regarding the telling of the Exodus from Egypt")<em> </em>before reciting the Hagada. This is not our practice, for several possible reasons: According to Me'iri, the <em>berakha</em> of "            <em>emet ve-emuna,</em>" recited following the recitation of the nighttime <em>Shema</em>, counts as the <em>berakha</em> on the Hagada. According
to Rabbeinu Yeruham, <em>kiddush</em> at the beginning of the Seder counts as the <em>berakha</em> on the Hagada<em>.</em> According to            <em>Responsa Rosh </em>24:2, it is not necessary to recite a <em>berakha</em> on the Hagada, since the main aspect of the mitzva is to eat the
            matza<em> </em>and <em>maror</em> while also telling the story. <em>Berakhot </em>are in fact recited on the matza and <em>maror</em>. According to
            Maharal (<em>Gevurot Hashem</em> 5:62), the key aspect of the mitzva is to understand, and we do not recite <em>berakhot </em>on thoughts.
According to <em>Shibolei Ha-leket</em>, the <em>berakha</em> recited at the end, <em>"asher ga'alanu</em>" ("Who has redeemed us"), is a            <em>berakha </em>on the Hagada. <em>Ma'aseh Nisim</em> adds that since we recite <em>"asher ga'alanu</em>" as part of the Hagada, we should not
recite a <em>berakha </em>beforehand just as one does not recite a <em>berakha</em> on the mitzva of reciting <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>. See            <em>Ha-Seder He-arukh </em>ch. 59 for more explanations.

. According to Ran and<em> </em>Ramban<em>, </em>one who recites the entire Hagada except for the sections about Pesah<em>, </em>matza, and<em>maror</em> fulfills his obligation, albeit not in the optimal fashion. Some explain that according to Rambam (MT Laws of <em>Hametz</em>            <em> </em>and Matza 8:4) and <em>Tosafot</em>, if one neglects to invoke Pesah<em>, </em>matza, and <em>maror</em> he does not fulfill his
            obligation to tell the story of the Exodus; see <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag </em>16. However, a literal reading of their words is not compelling, for it
is possible they referred to one who did not tell the story of the Exodus at all. If such a person mentions Pesah<em>, </em>matza, and            <em>maror</em> he fulfills his obligation, and if not, he does not. See <em>Birur Halakha</em> on <em>Pesahim</em><em> </em>116b which explains
            that the <em>poskim</em> debate the reason for mentioning Pesah<em>, </em>matza, and <em>maror</em>. Some maintain that invoking them is necessary
            for the proper fulfillment of eating Pesah<em>, </em>matza, and <em>maror</em>. Without explaining their meanings, one does not properly fulfill
            the <em>mitzvot</em> of eating them. Others maintain that invoking Pesah<em>, </em>matza, and <em>maror</em> is needed to properly perform the
            telling of the Exodus. <em>Binyan Tziyon</em> �30 suggests that <em>Pesah Sheini</em>, the make-up date for those who were unable to offer the
            Paschal sacrifice at its proper time,<em> </em>constitutes a practical difference between these two approaches: if invoking these elements is
            connected to the eating, one would still need to invoke them, but if it is connected to the telling of the story, one need not invoke them.
