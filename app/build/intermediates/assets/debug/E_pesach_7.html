Chapter Seven: <em>Hametz</em> Mixtures
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. Even a Drop of <em>Hametz</em> Renders Food Forbidden
</h2>
<p>
    In general, when a forbidden food becomes mixed with a permitted food, it is <em>batel be-shishim</em> (rendered insignificant if the forbidden food
    constitutes less than one sixtieth of the mixture); in such small quantities, it does not contribute flavor. At the level of Torah law, <em>hametz</em> is
    also <em>batel be-shishim</em>. The Sages, however, ordained that even a drop of <em>hametz</em> render a permitted food forbidden when mixed with it. Even
    if the quantity of permitted food is a thousand or ten thousand times greater than the <em>hametz</em>, the entire mixture becomes forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    The Sages added this stringency because the Torah itself is more stringent about <em>hametz</em> than other forbidden foods. This is true in two respects:
    1) generally, if one consumes a Torah-forbidden food, the punishment is <em>malkot </em>(lashes), but one who eats <em>hametz</em> incurs the more severe
    punishment of <em>karet </em>(extirpation); 2) whereas all other forbidden foods may be kept in one's home, <em>hametz</em> can neither be seen nor be
    found in our homes throughout Pesah. The Sages therefore continued in this direction by establishing a safeguard: even if a drop of <em>hametz</em> falls
    into a food, it is forbidden to consume or derive benefit from it. Another reason for this stringency is that all other forbidden foods are prohibited
    throughout the year, and we are therefore accustomed to distancing ourselves from them, but since we eat <em>hametz</em> all year long, we are liable to
    forget that it is forbidden on Pesah. The Sages, therefore, are more stringent about <em>hametz,</em> so that everybody remembers to be careful about it.
</p>
<p>
This law, that even a drop of <em>hametz</em> renders a mixture forbidden, goes into effect with the onset of Pesah. Before Pesah, <em>hametz</em> is<em>batel be-shishim</em> like all other forbidden foods. Although the prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> and the mitzva to dispose of    <em>hametz</em> go into effect at midday on the fourteenth of Nisan, the law that <em>hametz</em> is not <em>batel be-shishim</em> does not take effect
until Pesah begins. This is because one who consumes <em>hametz</em> incurs <em>karet</em> only once Pesah has begun, when the prohibitions of    <em>bal yera'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em> take effect (SA 447:2).

2. Can a Mixture Containing a Drop of <em>Hametz</em> Be Salvaged?    
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, the laws of <em>hametz </em>are uniquely strict: even a miniscule amount of <em>hametz</em> mixed with a permitted food renders the
    entire mixture forbidden for consumption or benefit. However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that if the <em>hametz </em>is less than one sixtieth of the
    mixture, one may salvage its monetary value by selling it to a gentile. For example, if a kilogram of <em>hametz</em> falls into a metric ton of another
    food, it is permitted to sell the mixture to a gentile as long as one first throws away a kilogram of the mixture in order to avoid benefiting from the
added <em>hametz</em>. This is because when the Sages forbade benefiting from such mixtures, their intention was to forbid benefiting from the    <em>hametz</em> as well. Thus, if one disposes of a quantity of the mixture equaling the amount of <em>hametz</em> that was added, he does not benefit from
    the <em>hametz</em>, and he can then sell the mixture to a gentile. If a single wheat grain of <em>hametz</em> fell into a large amount of cooked food, it
    all becomes forbidden to eat and benefit from as long as it remains in a Jew's hands, but one may sell it to a gentile. It is not necessary to dispose of
    any of the mixture, because the wheat did not cause the price to rise (SA 467:10).
</p>
<p>
    Rema (447:1), however, rules stringently in accordance with the opinion of a few Rishonim who maintain that since it is forbidden to derive benefit from
    the mixture, it is likewise forbidden to sell it to a gentile. Instead, the entire mixture must be destroyed. This is the practice of Ashkenazic Jews.
    However, if this will result in a very great loss, even those who follow the Ashkenazic custom may rely upon the opinion of those who permit selling the
    mixture to a gentile (MB 447:3).

3. Can <em>Hametz</em> That Was Nullified before Pesah Regain Its Status ("<em>Hozer Ve-ne'or</em>") on Pesah?
</h2>
<p>
    The Rishonim disagree over this fundamental question: Is <em>hametz</em> that was <em>batel be-shishim</em> before Pesah <em>hozer ve-ne'or </em>
("reawakened." i.e., its nullification is reversed) when Pesah arrives, or does its <em>bitul </em>before Pesah mean that it cannot be    <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>? If it is <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>, the entire mixture is rendered forbidden, because during Pesah even a drop of <em>hametz</em> is
    not nullified in any mixture. For example, a crumb of <em>hametz</em> that falls into a large dish of cooked meat before Pesah is obviously <em>batel</em>,
    and this food may even be consumed after midday on the fourteenth of Nisan. The question is whether it is still permissible to eat it after Pesah begins.
</p>
<p>
Some <em>poskim</em> rule that if <em>hametz</em> was <em>batel be-shishim</em> before Pesah, it is considered completely eradicated, and it cannot be    <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> on Pesah<em>. </em>Therefore, the entire mixture is permitted for consumption (Rosh, <em>Smag</em>, <em>Tur</em>, and others).
    Other <em>poskim</em> say that the annulment that takes place before Pesah is not effective; as soon as Pesah begins the <em>hametz</em> reawakens, and the
    entire mixture is rendered forbidden (Rambam, Rashba).
</p>
<p>
    This question has implications for the status of <em>matzot</em>. Occasionally, some water drips on a mound of wheat grains, causing a few of the grains to
leaven. It is very difficult to find these grains and remove them from the pile, but it is clear that the kosher wheat grains that did not become    <em>hametz</em> outnumber the leavened grains by more than sixty-to-one. According to the opinion that <em>hametz</em> is <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>, if all
    the wheat is ground together and <em>matzot</em> are baked from its flour, it will be forbidden to eat them on Pesah, because the drop of <em>hametz</em>
    in it renders all of the <em>matzot</em> forbidden. It is therefore important to make sure that there is not even a single leavened grain in the wheat from
which matza is made. However, according to the opinion that <em>hametz</em> that is nullified before Pesah is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>, the    <em>matzot</em> are kosher for Pesah. There is no need to check the wheat kernels one by one in order to remove the leavened ones, because they were
    already <em>batel be-shishim</em> before Pesah.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. <em>Hozer Ve-ne'or</em> in Practice
</h2>
<p>
    SA 447:4 rules that when <em>hametz</em> is <em>batel be-shishim</em> before Pesah it is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>, and therefore it is permissible to
    eat such a mixture on Pesah. This is because, according to the Torah, <em>hametz</em> is <em>batel be-shishim</em> even during Pesah. The Sages added the
    stringency of rendering a mixture forbidden because of even a drop of <em>hametz</em>. This means that the dispute about <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> relates to
    a rabbinic prohibition, and when in doubt about a rabbinic dispute, the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient opinion. This is the position adopted by most
    Sephardic Jews.
</p>
<p>
    Rema (<em>ad loc.</em>) rules in accordance with <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> (1:124), that if <em>hametz</em> that was <em>batel be-shishim</em> before
    Pesah was a fluid mixture (<em>lah</em>), the <em>halakha </em>follows the lenient opinion, and the <em>hametz </em>is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>. If,
    however, it was a solid (<em>yavesh</em>), the law follows the stringent opinion, and it is <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>. For example, if a drop of beer falls
    into another beverage, it blends with the liquid and ceases to exist independently. As a result, after being nullified, it is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>
    and does not render the mixture forbidden. However, if a crumb of <em>hametz</em> falls into a solid food, because it continues to exist independently and
    does not blend with the mixture, it has a degree of significance. Therefore, when Pesah arrives it is <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> and renders the entire
    mixture forbidden. This is the approach adopted by Ashkenazic Jews and some Sephardic Jews.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    Flour, because of its fineness, is considered a fluid mixture. This is because the distinction between fluid and solid depends principally upon whether or
    not the forbidden food blends completely with the permitted food. In a fluid mixture, the forbidden food blends completely with the permitted food, and in
a solid mixture the forbidden food remains independent. Accordingly, there is no need to check the wheat grains before they are ground and baked into    <em>matzot</em>, because after the wheat is ground, the flour produced from the leavened grains will be nullified and blend completely with the rest of the
    flour, and when Pesah arrives it will not reawaken to render the mixture forbidden (SA and Rema 453:3).
</p>
<p>
Based on this principle, some <em>poskim </em>say that it is best to bake <em>matzot</em> before Pesah so that if some flour or dough becomes    <em>hametz</em> during the kneading process, it will blend with the rest of the dough and be <em>batel be-shishim</em> before Pesah. This assures that it
    will not reawaken and render the <em>matzot</em> forbidden during Pesah. Sometimes, when machine <em>matzot</em> are being baked, particles of dough get
    stuck in the tines of the machine and remain there long enough to become <em>hametz</em>, whereupon they fall back into the dough. However, because the
pieces of dough that became <em>hametz </em>blend completely with the rest of the dough, it is considered a fluid mixture, and since the <em>hametz</em> is    <em>batel be-shishim</em> before Pesah, it is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>.
</p>
<p>
    All of this is <em>be-di'avad</em>, but one should preferably take care to bake <em>matzot</em> from wheat that certainly has not become <em>hametz </em>
    and guard against the smallest crumb of flour or dough becoming <em>hametz</em>.

5. Does <em>Hametz</em> That Imparts Foul Taste ("<em>Noten Ta'am Li-fgam</em>") Render a Mixture Forbidden?
</h2>
<p>
    There is a well-known rule that something that imparts foul taste ("<em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em>") does not render a mixture forbidden. For example, if
    non-kosher meat falls into a pot of kosher food, and the quantity of kosher food is sixty times that of the non-kosher meat, the taste of the non-kosher
    meat is nullified, and it is permitted to eat the food. On the other hand, if the kosher food is not sixty times the quantity of the non-kosher meat, it is
forbidden to eat the food, because the taste of the non-kosher meat is discernible in the mixture. If, however, the taste of the non-kosher meat is foul ("    <em>pagum</em>"), since it spoils the cooked dish, it does not render it non-kosher. Therefore, as long as the kosher food constitutes the majority of the
    mixture, it is permitted to eat it (SA YD �103).
</p>
<p>
What about a <em>hametz</em> mixture on Pesah? Some <em>poskim</em> (Rashbam, Rashba) say that the fact that the Sages, due to the gravity of the    <em>hametz</em> prohibition, ordained that even a drop of <em>hametz</em> renders any mixture forbidden indicates that the matter does not depend upon the
    taste it gives to the mixture. Therefore, even when it contributes a foul taste, it is no different than a drop of <em>hametz</em> that renders its entire
    mixture forbidden.
</p>
<p>
The opinion of most Rishonim (Rabbeinu Tam, Ri, Rosh, and<em> Mordechai</em>) is that <em>hametz</em> is like other prohibited foods except with regard to<em>bitul be-shishim</em>. Where other forbidden foods do not render a mixture forbidden, however, like in cases of <em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em>,    <em> hametz</em> also does not render a mixture forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, SA 447:10 rules leniently whereas Rema writes that in Ashkenazic communities the custom is to follow the stringent ruling that even a drop of
    foul-tasting <em>hametz</em> renders an entire mixture forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    Let us clarify this disagreement by way of an example: a pot in which non-kosher meat is cooked absorbs the taste of the non-kosher meat. If the same pot
    is then used to cook kosher food, the kosher food will absorb the taste of non-kosher meat exuded by the pot, rendering it forbidden. However, if more than
    twenty-four hours passed since the cooking of the non-kosher meat, the taste absorbed by the pot is <em>pagum</em>, and if some other food is cooked in it,
    it will not be rendered forbidden, because the pot is <em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, if one inadvertently cooks in a <em>hametz</em> pot during Pesah, according to <em>Shulhan Arukh </em>and most <em>poskim</em> since more than
    twenty-four hours have passed since <em>hametz</em> was cooked in the pot, the food is kosher. However, according to Ashkenazic custom, although the taste
of <em>hametz</em> absorbed into the pot is foul, it renders the food forbidden, because during Pesah we take the stringent position that even    <em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em> renders a food forbidden.

6. The Torah Law Concerning <em>Hametz</em> Mixtures
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah law concerning a <em>hametz</em> mixture is complicated and subject to dispute among Tanna'im, Amora'im, Rishonim, and Aharonim. We shall
    summarize its laws here succinctly.
</p>
<p>
    The Torah declares that one who eats a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> on Pesah incurs <em>karet</em>. If the <em>hametz</em> is mixed with other foods
    and the mixture contains a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> in a <em>shi'ur akhilat pras</em> of kosher food (an olive's bulk of <em>hametz</em> in
    three or four eggs' bulk of kosher food), Ramban and other Rishonim rule that his punishment is <em>karet</em>, while Rif and Rambam maintain that his
    punishment is only <em>malkot </em>(lashes).
</p>
<p>
    If <em>hametz</em> mixes with the same type of food, for example, leavened flour with unleavened flour, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that since they taste
    the same, the <em>hametz</em> flour is nullified by the majority (<em>batel be-rov</em>) at the Torah level, though there is still a rabbinic prohibition
    against eating it.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to the prohibition against keeping <em>hametz</em> on Pesah, if a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> becomes mixed with permitted food, and
    the permitted food is less than sixty times the quantity of the <em>hametz</em>, one violates both <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
According to Torah law, if the mixture is more than sixty times the quantity of the <em>hametz</em>, the <em>hametz</em> is <em>batel</em>. If the    <em>hametz</em> becomes mixed with its own kind - for example, leavened flour with unleavened flour - and there is more of the kosher ingredient than the
    non-kosher, according to Torah law the <em>hametz</em> is <em>batel</em> and no prohibition is violated. Nevertheless, the Sages ordained that the mixture
    must be disposed of, lest one end up eating it on Pesah.

. According to <em>She'iltot, </em>Rabbeinu Tam<em>, </em>and Raz, <em>hametz</em> is similar to other forbidden foods and is            <em>batel be-shishim</em>. All other <em>poskim</em> (including Rif, Rosh, and Rambam) maintain that <em>hametz</em> is not <em>batel </em>even in
            a thousand-to-one ratio, as per the opinion of Rava, following Rav, in <em>Pesahim</em> 30a. Even Rabbeinu Tam<em> </em>and Raz refrained from
            acting leniently (see <em>Birur Halakha ad loc.</em>). However, MB<em> </em>447:2 states, citing Aharonim, that in a case where there are other
            factors that support a lenient ruling, <em>She'iltot</em> and Rabbeinu Tam can also be taken into consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aforementioned reasons for the strict nature of <em>hametz</em> are from Rashi, Rosh, <em>Smak</em>, Rabbeinu Yona, and many others. The first
            reason is the principal one, and therefore <em>hametz</em> becomes forbidden in the most minuscule quantities only once Pesah begins. However,
            Rambam<em> </em>and Ramban explain that the reason a tiny amount of <em>hametz</em> is forbidden is that after Pesah it will again become
            permitted, since on the Torah level <em>hametz</em> <em>she-avar alav ha-Pesah</em> is permissible, and anything that will become permissible in
the future (<em>davar she-yesh lo matirin</em>) is not <em>batel</em> in any mixture. According to this opinion, the tiniest amounts of            <em>hametz</em> are forbidden as early as midday of the fourteenth, and this is indeed what <em>Magid Mishneh</em> claims is Rambam's opinion. This
            is also the opinion of several Rishonim and Aharonim. It is possible, however, that according to this, <em>hametz </em>is not <em>batel </em>after
midday on the fourteenth unless it is mixed with the same sort of food item (<em>min be-mino</em>). <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 447:46 and<em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag </em>9:23 quote those who adopt this opinion. Nonetheless, even based on the rationale that we are used to eating            <em>hametz</em>, there are still grounds to forbid even the tiniest amounts of <em>hametz</em> starting from midday of the fourteenth, as Ran
            writes.
        </p>
        <p>
            SA adopts the opinion that tiny amounts of <em>hametz</em> only become forbidden once Pesah begins, and most Aharonim accept this view.

            . There is a dispute as to whether or not one is forbidden to derive benefit from a mixture of <em>hametz</em> and non<em>-hametz</em>. According
            to Rif, Rosh,<em> </em>and the majority of <em>poskim</em>, <em>hametz</em> causes the entire mixture to become forbidden, whereas Ramban and
            Raavad maintain that the mixture is only prohibited for eating, but it is permissible to derive benefit from it. SA 447:1 adopts the former view.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, according to Rif<em> </em>and<em> </em>Rosh<em>, </em>if one would discard the value of the <em>hametz</em> in the mixture, he would be
            permitted to sell the mixture to a gentile, since ultimately he obtains no benefit from the <em>hametz</em>; rather, he merely receives payment for
            the portion of the mixture that is not <em>hametz</em><em>.</em> The overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em>, including SA 467:10, agree with
            this. However, Rema writes in <em>Darkhei Moshe</em> 447:2 that <em>Mordechai, Terumat Ha-deshen</em>, and Mahari Brin all adopt a stringent
            approach - that the entire mixture must be burned. MB<em> </em>447:3 states in the name of Aharonim<em> </em>that in a situation of potential
            severe monetary loss one may sell such a mixture to a gentile. Additionally, SHT 467:74 in the name of <em>Beit Meir</em> states that if one will
            suffer severe monetary losses despite selling the mixture to a gentile, he may even keep the mixture until after Pesah, and then eat it or sell it
            to a Jew.

            . The custom of the Sephardim: 
            <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em>
            447:76-78 states that many Sephardim have the custom to be stringent about <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>, and this is the opinion of <em>Pri Hadash</em>
            and Hida in <em>Birkei Yosef</em> 447:14. It seems that these authorities were also stringent about liquid mixtures. <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> adds
            that Sephardim have the custom to be as strict as Rema<em>, </em>but no more. This is similar to what <em>Zekhor Le-Avraham</em> states: Sephardim
            on Pesah follow Rema. Nonetheless, SA cites the lenient position anonymously, which indicates that it is completely lenient in this matter.
Additionally, <em>Yabi'a Omer</em> OH 2:23 expands on the topic and reinforces the lenient opinions, arguing that most Rishonim are lenient about            <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>. Moreover, according to <em>She'iltot</em> <em>hametz</em> is <em>batel be-shishim</em> even on Pesah, and even those who
            are stringent maintain that this prohibition is rabbinic, and in a dispute about rabbinic law we are lenient.
        </p>
        <p>
SA (442:4)<em> </em>cites Rambam that "<em>tiryaka</em>" (a type of edible medicine) is prohibited on Pesah since it contains a drop of            <em>hametz</em> that becomes reawakened once Pesah begins, and renders the entire mixture forbidden. This seems to contradict what SA stated in
447:4. According to Rema, SA<em> </em>retracted what was written in �442 and permitted <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>. <em>Pri Hadash</em> explains that<em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> applies in a case where one intentionally mixed <em>hametz</em> into the mixture. <em>Taz</em> states that            <em>tiryaka </em>is forbidden because the <em>hametz</em><em> </em>in<em> </em>it acts as a stabilizer (<em>davar ha-ma'amid</em>) in the mixture.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also important to note
            that even according to the lenient opinions that <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> is permitted (according to SA - in all cases; according to Rema<em> </em>-
            in liquid mixtures)<em>,</em> it is forbidden to intentionally blend <em>hametz</em> into a mixture before Pesah and annul it in a sixty-to-one
            ratio in order to eat the mixture on Pesah (as per <em>Pri Hadash</em>'s explanation of SA and MB 447:102 at the end). The only time such a mixture
            is permissible is if the <em>hametz</em> was mixed in unintentionally. According to the stringent opinions, since the mixture may not be eaten, it
also may not be kept in one's house, though if one kept the mixture in his house over Pesah anyway, he is permitted to eat it after Pesah (MB            <em> </em>447:102).
        </p>
        <p>
            MB 453:32 states that according to <em>Taz</em>, if a bit of <em>hametz</em> was already mixed in before Pesah and there are less than sixty parts
of permissible food in the mixture to annul the <em>hametz</em>, one is permitted to add more permissible food to the mixture to nullify the            <em>hametz</em>. However, MA and most <em>poskim</em> maintain that this is forbidden, since it appears that he is intentionally trying to nullify
            a forbidden food. In extreme situations one may rely on the lenient opinions.

            . <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> 1:114 states that flour is considered a fluid mixture, and this is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em>, as
            MB<em> </em>states in 447:32. However, <em>Bah </em>states that according to <em>Smak</em> and Raavya, flour mixed with flour is considered a solid
            mixture; therefore, one should preferably take care that no leavened flour mixes with the matza<em> </em>flour. This is also the opinion cited in
            MB 453:17 and SHT 25. Additionally, it is clear that one should preferably take into consideration the opinions that all <em>hametz</em> reawakens
            on Pesah, whether solid or liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us note three opinions regarding the rationale for the law of <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>. According to the most stringent opinion,            <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> applies even in a fluid mixture, even if the <em>hametz</em> itself has been removed and only a minuscule amount of taste
was absorbed into the mixture, and even though this taste is not discernible. The second opinion, cited in MB 453:17 in the name of<em>Olat Shabbat</em> and <em>Eliya Rabba</em>, is that <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> only applies if one re-cooks the mixture, which would cause the            <em>hametz</em> to add taste to the mixture. The third opinion is that of MA, quoted by MB <em>ad loc</em>., that <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> applies
            only to solid foods and only when there is still actual <em>hametz</em> remaining in the mixture.

. The custom of the Ashkenazic community is to be stringent, as we have said; however, MB 447:98 states (citing <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em>)            <em> </em>that where there is no established custom, one may act leniently, though one who acts stringently is commended. Sephardic custom follows
            SA, although some are stringent (<em>Kaf Ha-hayim </em>447:228). Rema 447:2 states that the custom to be stringent about <em>hametz pagum </em>only
            applies once Pesah begins, but before the onset of the holiday, the <em>hametz</em> is nullified even in less than a sixty-to-one ratio, like the
            normal case of foods that spoil the taste of a mixture into which they fall.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also important to stress
            that according to all opinions, one is not permitted to use a utensil that absorbed the taste of a forbidden food, even more than twenty-four hours
            after absorption. This is because the Sages were concerned that if they permitted the use of such utensils after twenty-four hours, people would
            make mistakes and use them even within twenty-four hours and would end up eating forbidden foods. Understandably, this is also the <em>halakha</em>
            on Pesah. If one violated this prohibition and intentionally used a utensil that had absorbed forbidden foods more than twenty-four hours prior,
most <em>poskim</em> maintain that he is not permitted to eat the food due to a rabbinic penalty imposed on him (MB 442:1;            <em>Knesset Ha-gedola </em>YD �122, <em>Hagahot Ha-Tur</em> �26).

. If one did not dispose of it, since he did not violate <em>bal yeira'eh </em>or<em> bal yimatzei</em> he is permitted to benefit from the            <em>hametz</em> after Pesah. Regarding eating the <em>hametz</em> after Pesah, <em>Eliya Rabba</em> claims that since he violated a rabbinic
            prohibition by keeping it over Pesah, he may not eat it, although according to MA, cited in MB 447:102, he is allowed to eat it.
