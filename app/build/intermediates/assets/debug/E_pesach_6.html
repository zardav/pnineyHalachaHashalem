Chapter Six: <em>Mekhirat Hametz - </em>the Sale of <em>Hametz</em>
</h1>

1. Sparing <em>Hametz</em> from Destruction by Selling It to a Gentile
</h2>
<p>
    By midday of the fourteenth of Nisan, every Jew must have disposed of the <em>hametz</em> in his possession. In the past, Jews would plan their food
    purchases and their meals so that by Pesah they would have finished consuming any <em>hametz </em>foods and thus not have to dispose of large quantities.
    They would leave only a small amount of <em>hametz</em> with which to fulfill the mitzva of <em>bi'ur hametz</em> in the best possible manner: by burning
    it.
</p>
<p>
    However, occasionally one's plan would backfire and he would find himself possessing a large quantity of <em>hametz</em> when Pesah arrived. In such a
    case, if he did not mind losing the <em>hametz,</em> he could burn it or give it as a gift to a decent and deserving gentile. If he did not want to lose
    the value of his <em>hametz</em>, he could sell it to a gentile before Pesah, since, as long as the prohibition has not gone into effect, it is permissible
    to sell the <em>hametz</em> and receive its full value. The prohibition against deriving benefit from <em>hametz</em> goes into effect on the sixth hour on
    the day of the fourteenth of Nisan, and until that time it is permissible to sell the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    This was especially important for food merchants who would remain with large stocks of <em>hametz</em> before Pesah and had no choice but to sell to a
    gentile, in order to avoid great financial loss. Even if a gentile could not be found who was sincerely interested in buying all of the <em>hametz</em>,
    the Sages teach that it is permissible for a Jew to say to a gentile, "Even though you do not need so much <em>hametz</em>, buy all of my <em>hametz</em>
    for the full price, and if you want, I will buy it back from you after Pesah" (based on <em>t.</em> <em>Pesahim</em> 2:7).
</p>

2. How the Practice of Selling <em>Hametz </em>Spread
</h2>
<p>
    About 400 years ago, many Jews living in Europe began to support themselves through the production and sale of whiskey. This was because the barons, the
    landowners, would often contract Jews to manage their affairs, and it was common for them to lease their distilleries and inns to Jews in exchange for a
    fixed price and/or a percentage of sales. This whiskey, which was made from barley and wheat, is considered <em>hametz gamur</em>. To prevent the great
    financial loss that would come each year with its disposal before Pesah, it became necessary to sell it to a gentile before Pesah and buy it back again
    immediately thereafter, in order to continue selling the whiskey as usual.
</p>
<p>
Over time, rabbinic leaders noticed that the sale was sometimes carried out improperly, leading to serious problems. If the sale is improper, the    <em>hametz</em> remains in the possession of the Jew, and with every hour that passes he violates <em>bal yera'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>.
    Additionally, it is forbidden to derive benefit from such <em>hametz</em> after Pesah, and it must all be completely destroyed. Therefore, rabbinic
    authorities began to oversee the sale of <em>hametz</em>, in order to ensure its proper sale. Seeing that the sale was being carried out in an orderly
manner, other Jews began to participate in the transaction, in order to save their own <em>hametz</em> from being lost. This is how    <em>mekhirat hametz</em> began to spread and become increasingly common.
</p>
<p>
    However, a number of prominent rabbis claimed that <em>mekhirat</em> <em>hametz</em> was not a real sale, but merely a fiction. In the first place, it is
    clear that after Pesah the <em>hametz</em> will return to the Jew. Moreover, no sales tax is paid to the government on this sale. Thirdly, in a normal sale
the buyer pays for all of the <em>hametz</em> and physically takes it into his possession, but here the gentile neither pays the full price, nor takes the    <em>hametz</em> with him.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, the opinion of the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> is that <em>mekhirat hametz</em> may be relied upon and is as valid as any sale. By law,
    the gentile can refuse to sell the <em>hametz</em> back to the Jew after Pesah. It is a bona fide sale, not a fiction. Nevertheless, in order to avoid even
    the appearance of a fiction, the rabbis made a practice of being very meticulous about all details of the sale. Since there are different halakhic opinions
    regarding the proper mode of purchase when a gentile buys from a Jew, the rabbis are careful to execute the sale using all forms of acquisition, so that it
    is clear that the sale is effective according to all opinions. In addition, they make sure that the sale is effective according to state laws as well (see
    MB 448:17, 19, and BHL <em>ad loc</em>.).
</p>
<p>
    Regarding payment, a bill of sale is formulated to reflect the actual value of the <em>hametz</em>, and the gentile pays a cash deposit, as merchants are
    wont to do. The remainder of the sum is charged to him as a debt, but this does not prevent the completion of the purchase. After Pesah, the gentile can
    decide: if he wants to keep the <em>hametz</em>, he must pay the debt; if he wants to sell the <em>hametz</em> back to the Jew, the Jew repays the cash
    deposit, and in return for the <em>hametz</em>, he pardons the gentile's debt from before Pesah. The reason no tax is paid on <em>mekhirat hametz</em> is
    that the king, or government, understands that this sale is carried out for religious, not commercial purposes, and therefore waives the tax.
</p>
<p>
    In order to reinforce the sale, so that it resembles any other sale in which the buyer takes the purchased item into his possession, the rabbis ordained
    that the Jew sell to the gentile the ground on which the <em>hametz</em> rests, thereby transferring the <em>hametz</em> into the gentile's possession (MB
    448:12). In Eretz Yisrael, where it is forbidden to sell land to a gentile, the area is rented, and some <em>poskim</em> say that even outside Eretz
    Yisrael it is best to rent the area instead of selling it.

3. For Whom Is the <em>Hametz</em> Sale Intended Today? 
</h2>
<p>
    In recent generations, new storage methods have been introduced that allow us to preserve food products for long periods of time. As a result, food
    manufacturers and dealers are in constant possession of large inventories of food, and they need to sell their <em>hametz</em> before Pesah in order not to
    lose the value of their stock. Moreover, if food manufacturers were to make a point of exhausting their entire inventory before Pesah, it would take days
    and even weeks to restock and market their products, and in the mean time, they would lose business. Even if no competitors were to seize the opportunity,
    it would cause a great inconvenience to buyers, who would be unable to purchase <em>hametz</em> foods during the weeks after Pesah. Therefore, factory
    owners, food chains, and stores sell all of their <em>hametz</em> to a gentile before Pesah, and as soon as Pesah passes, they buy it back again and
    remarket it.
</p>
<p>
    In principle, anyone may sell his <em>hametz</em> to a gentile via the <em>mekhirat</em> <em>hametz</em> organized by his local rabbis. He may do so even
    if he only wishes to sell a small amount of <em>hametz</em> - for example, a package of pasta - because once it has been sold, the Jew no longer violates
    the prohibitions relating to <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Some are stringent and prefer not to rely on <em>mekhirat</em> <em>hametz </em>since it appears fictitious: the <em>hametz</em> remains in the Jew's house,
    the gentile will almost certainly not come to take it, and the Jew resumes eating the very same <em>hametz</em> as soon as Pesah is over. According to
these <em>poskim</em>, it is only possible to sell <em>hametz</em> in order to prevent a great loss; concerning a small loss, one should not sell his    <em>hametz</em>, in order to avoid possible transgression.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, all are advised to participate in <em>mekhirat hametz</em>, because some food products and flavored medicines may contain small amounts of    <em>hametz</em>, and they should not be destroyed just because of this possibility. On the other hand, these must not be kept because they may actually
    contain <em>hametz</em>. Therefore, to avoid all doubt, the best thing to do is to sell them.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    Concerning <em>hametz gamur</em>, people are advised not to sell insignificant amounts of <em>hametz</em>, so as not to use the <em>mekhirat hametz</em>
    for small needs. However, when a significant loss is involved, it is permitted, even <em>le-khathila</em>, to sell the <em>hametz</em>. Each individual
    should decide for himself what he considers a significant or small loss. Nonetheless, one is permitted to sell his <em>hametz</em> even if he only wants to
    prevent a small loss, for <em>mekhirat hametz</em> is fundamentally halakhically valid, and one may be confident that the rabbis conducting the sale do so
    in full compliance with <em>halakha</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    Because the sold <em>hametz</em> remains in the Jew's house, there is a risk that he will forget that it is prohibited and eat it during Pesah. Therefore,
one must set up a partition at least ten <em>tefahim</em> high (80 cm) to act as a barrier between himself and the <em>hametz</em>, or lock the    <em>hametz</em> in a cupboard and hide the key. One may also tape up the cupboard. It is advisable to write "sold <em>hametz</em>" on it so that one does
    not accidentally open it on Pesah (see SA 440:2).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. The Laws of the Sale
</h2>
<p>
    Every Jew, before selling <em>hametz</em>, should read the authorization contract he will be signing, so that he understands that he is empowering the
    rabbi to sell his <em>hametz</em>, and that the sale is absolute. Nonetheless, if instead of reading the contract one simply relied on the rabbi, the sale
    is valid, for, if the gentile comes during Pesah to take the <em>hametz</em>, and the<em> </em>rabbi tells the Jew that the <em>hametz</em> indeed belongs
    to the gentile, and that he must give it to him, the Jew will do so.
</p>
<p>
    The seller should write his name and address in clear script on the contract of sale so that the gentile knows who he is and where he lives. In this
    manner, the gentile buyer will be able, if he wants, to go to the seller's house and take the <em>hametz</em> (see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:7-8,
    and in the notes).
</p>
<p>
    It is most preferable to give the gentile the key to the place where the <em>hametz</em> is located so that he can enter and take it at any time. In
    practice, though, it is sufficient to give the gentile the seller's phone number so that when the gentile wants the <em>hametz</em>,<em> </em>he can call
    to come and take it. The most important principle is that sellers of <em>hametz</em> should be aware that after the sale, the <em>hametz</em> indeed
    belongs to the gentile, and the seller must allow him to enter the house and take his <em>hametz</em> (MB 448:12).
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, the seller should indicate the various types of <em>hametz</em>, and their prices, on the contract the rabbi gives him to sign, and some people
    are meticulous about this. In practice, though, this is very difficult to carry out. Therefore, the custom is to write that all <em>hametz</em> in one's
    possession is included in the sale, and that the price is in accordance with the accepted market price, as determined by appraisers (see BHL 448:3, s.v.
    "be-davar mu'at").
</p>
<p>
    It is best to write in the contract where exactly the <em>hametz</em> is located, for example: "In the upper left kitchen cupboard," or "in the room on the
    right, in the box so marked." Several places may be listed. Even without this, the sale is still valid, though all <em>hametz </em>should be gathered to
    one place and labeled. Everything gathered to the place determined for the sale by two hours before the onset of the prohibition against deriving benefit
    from <em>hametz </em>is included in the sale.
</p>
<p>
    As noted, the preferred custom is to sell or rent to the gentile the place upon which the <em>hametz</em> rests, so that the <em>hametz</em> will be in the
    possession of the gentile, and the sale will appear to be like any other sale in which the buyer transfers possession.
</p>
<p>
    One may sell <em>hametz </em>through a proxy who writes all relevant details and signs on the owner's behalf. One may also sell <em>hametz</em> over the
    phone, by fax, or via the Internet. Usually, the person selling <em>hametz</em> signs and performs a <em>kinyan </em>(act of acquisition) in order to
    empower the rabbi as a <em>shali'ah</em>. Nonetheless, the <em>kinyan</em> is not crucial, as the most important thing is the transaction between the rabbi
    and the gentile, which is effective for everyone who has appointed the rabbi to sell his <em>hametz</em> (<em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 19:4, 9-10).
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    In kitchens that belong to public institutions, the manager or his representative sells the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    One should not sell the <em>hametz</em> that is absorbed into utensils. Quite a few laws relating to <em>mekhirat hametz</em> were introduced in order to
    make it clear to all that it is an actual sale, but if one writes that he is selling the <em>hametz</em> absorbed in his utensils, the sale will appear to
    be lacking seriousness, since <em>hametz</em> absorbed in utensils has no value and nobody is interested in buying <em>hametz</em> absorbed in utensils.
    The same applies to <em>hametz</em> stuck to utensils. Therefore, one should not indicate this in the sale contract.

</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. The Deadline for Selling <em>Hametz</em> and the Status of One Visiting Israel or Abroad
</h2>
<p>
    The sale must take place while it is still permitted to derive benefit from <em>hametz</em>, for when the sixth hour of the day of the fourteenth of Nisan
    arrives, and it becomes forbidden to derive benefit from <em>hametz</em>, it likewise becomes forbidden to sell it. Instead, it must be destroyed. In order
    to allow people to sell their <em>hametz</em> until the very last minute, <em>mekhirat hametz</em> takes place on the fourteenth, just before the end of
    the time that it is permissible to derive benefit from <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The prohibition takes effect according to one's location. In Israel, the sixth hour arrives approximately seven hours before the East Coast of the United
    States. Therefore, a U.S. resident who is in Israel must sell his <em>hametz</em> in Israel, because if he sells his <em>hametz</em> according to the
    deadline in the United States, the sale will take place after the onset of the prohibition incumbent upon him. The end of Pesah also poses a problem for
    such a person, because he must observe <em>yom tov sheni shel galuyot </em>(the extra day of Yom Tov observed in the Diaspora), which means that the
    prohibition of <em>hametz</em> applies to him until the end of the eighth day, while in Israel the <em>hametz</em> is bought back from the gentile after
    the seventh day. However, in fact, it is not a problem for him to sell his <em>hametz</em> in Israel. Even though the gentile sells the <em>hametz</em>
    back at the end of seven days, since the U.S. resident is still observing Pesah according to the custom of Jews in <em>hutz la-aretz</em>, and he is not
    yet interested in buying the <em>hametz </em>back, the <em>hametz</em> remains <em>hefker</em> or in the possession of the <em>beit din </em>(rabbinical
    court). Only after <em>yom tov sheni shel galuyot</em> has passed does the <em>hametz</em> return to his possession.
</p>
<p>
    If his family remains in the United States, and they plan to eat the <em>hametz</em> after the prohibition has commenced in Eretz Yisrael, he must renounce
    ownership of his portion in that <em>hametz</em>, and his family sells the <em>hametz</em> there (<em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:14).
</p>
<p>
    A resident of Israel who travels to the U.S. may, in principle, sell his <em>hametz</em> in the United States, for, according to most <em>poskim</em>, the
    obligation to eliminate <em>hametz</em> depends on the owner's location, not the location of the <em>hametz. </em>Nevertheless, one should preferably sell
    it in Eretz Yisrael, in order to satisfy the opinions of all <em>poskim</em>, for some maintain that one must eliminate <em>hametz</em> according to its
    location, and, if this is the case, one must sell the <em>hametz</em> before the onset of the prohibition in Eretz Yisrael.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, a resident of Israel who is visiting a Diaspora community should not eat <em>hametz </em>on the eighth day of Pesah, just as he should not do
    any other activity forbidden on <em>yom tov</em>, even in private (AHS 596:5). If such a person has his own place of residence, he need not partake in a
    second Seder. However, if he is being hosted by people who live abroad, he should participate in the second Seder. He should not recite <em>berakhot </em>
    on <em>mitzvot</em>, but instead should answer "Amen" to the <em>berakhot </em>of others.

6. <em>Hametz</em> That Was Sold - Its Status after esah
</h2>
<p>
    After Pesah, it is best not to use the <em>hametz</em> that was sold until one can assume that the rabbi has bought it all back. When necessary, though,
one may take out some <em>hametz</em> immediately after Pesah with a willingness to pay the gentile for it were he to request this. It is best that the    <em>beit din</em> make an explicit condition with the gentile that the Jew will be obligated to pay for any sold <em>hametz</em> he takes, if the gentile
    so desires. Thus, there will be no question about the Jew taking <em>hametz</em> immediately after Pesah (see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:22).
</p>
<p>
Some people are strict and do not eat <em>hametz</em> that was sold because, according to stringent <em>poskim</em>, such a sale is not legitimate and this    <em>hametz</em> has the status of <em>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesah</em>, which one may neither eat nor derive benefit from.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, however, one need not be concerned about complying with this stringency, because the prohibition of <em>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesah</em> is
    rabbinic, and whenever there is uncertainty about a rabbinic law, <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient opinion. This is all the more true where only a
    small number of <em>poskim</em> are strict, while the overwhelming majority permit. Indeed, there were great rabbis who, after Pesah, would make a point of
    eating <em>hametz</em> that had been sold through <em>mekhirat hametz</em>, in order to demonstrate that the sale was done in keeping with <em>halakha</em>
    .
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
When shopping for food after Pesah, one must make sure that the seller has a certificate verifying that he sold his <em>hametz</em> in keeping with the    <em>halakha</em> so that one does not buy <em>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesah</em>. Even more caution is needed if the seller is not religious, because if he
    did not understand the significance of the sale and continued to sell <em>hametz</em> in his store during Pesah, a few <em>poskim</em> (<em>Sde Hemed</em>,
    Maharam Schick) maintain that the sale was not legitimate, and that it is forbidden to eat or derive benefit from any <em>hametz</em> in his store. In this
    case, one must preferably follow the stringent <em>poskim</em> and wait for goods produced after Pesah to arrive. If, however, it is clear that the seller
    performed <em>bedikat hametz</em> in keeping with the <em>halakha</em>, and was careful not to let anybody go near the <em>hametz</em> that was sold, it is
    permissible to buy <em>hametz</em> from him as soon as Pesah has ended (<em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:13, 23).

            . <em>Tevu'ot Shor</em>, a commentary on <em>Pesahim</em>,<em> </em>is hesitant about the idea of selling <em>hametz</em>, since it might be
considered a fiction. <em>Bah, Eliya Rabba, </em>and <em>Mahatzit Ha-shekel</em> (�448) state that one should not rely on <em>mekhirat</em>            <em>hametz</em> except in extreme situations, to prevent a significant loss. In <em>Ma'aseh Rav</em> (a compendium of the Vilna Gaon's customs) it
            is written that one should only sell <em>hametz</em> <em>gamur</em> in an irrevocable sale, and after Pesah one should not purchase <em>hametz</em>
            that had been sold in a standard <em>hametz</em> sale. This was also the practice of Rabbi Akiva Eger. See <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11, n.
            38 and <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 10:14 and 11:31. Over time several of the concerns of those opposed to selling <em>hametz</em> have been allayed
            by the addition of specific clauses to the sale. For example, <em>Bekhor Shor</em> claimed that the gentile buying the <em>hametz</em> does not
            understand the details of a legal sale, but nowadays, we sell our <em>hametz</em> to knowledgeable Gentiles who certainly understand the legal
            ramifications of the sale. Another allegation was that the <em>hametz</em> was sold for a symbolic sum, as written in SA 448:3, and those opposed
            to the sale claimed that the seller in such a case does not have full intention to sell. The answer to this problem was that the Jewish seller
would certainly agree to sell his <em>hametz</em> for a nominal fee in order to save himself from violating the prohibition of owning<em>hametz</em>, as is written in <em>Hok Yaakov</em>. Nowadays, however, our custom is to sell the <em>hametz</em> for its full value, as per MB            <em> </em>and BHL 448:19, which effectively eliminates this issue.

            . It is impossible to list all of the <em>poskim</em> who permit the sale of <em>hametz</em>, since there are too many, but I will mention several
of them: <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda </em>141:8<em>, Hatam Sofer </em>OH <em> </em>�62<em> </em>and<em> </em>�113<em>, Oneg Yom Tov 28, </em>and            <em> Sdei Hemed </em>8:9, which discusses the opposition to the sale at length. See also R. Zevin's <em>Ha-m</em><em>o'adim Be-halakha</em> in the
            chapter about selling <em>hametz</em> and its evolution. <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH <em> </em>2:95 states that the sale works even if the seller is
            not an observant Jew. MB<em> </em>448:12 discusses the optimal procedure of selling the area where the <em>hametz</em> sits as well<em>.</em> There
            are those who prefer to rent their rooms or houses that contain <em>hametz</em>, since they themselves are only renting and therefore cannot sell
            the house. Additionally, <em>Avnei Nezer </em>�345 states that renting is preferable, since it seems less fictitious, as one certainly does not
            really want to sell his house. See <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag </em>11:10 in the notes.

            . <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:5 states that there are those who maintain that one who has money invested directly or indirectly in stock of
            companies that produce <em>hametz</em> must sell these shares before Pesah. Consequently, all <em>hametz</em> sale documents include clauses
            regarding stocks and shares in these types of companies. However, according to the letter of the law, if one does not have any decision-making
            power in the company, he is considered a creditor, not a partner, and he would not be required to sell his shares, as explained above in 3:3. Thus,
one who sells his shares in this particular company does so merely to satisfy all opinions. Above at 4:11 we cited a dispute between            <em>poskim</em> regarding whether or not one can exempt himself from <em>bedikat hametz</em> by selling his home to a gentile. According to all
            opinions, however, if the Jewish owner leaves one room in the house for himself, he can perform <em>bedikat hametz</em> in that room and exempt
            himself from <em>bedikat hametz</em> in the rest of the house. <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 8:17 states that in addition to <em>bitul</em>, one
            should sell all of the <em>hametz</em> in his possession, since if he was unaware of a certain piece of <em>hametz</em> during the time of
            nullification and did not nullify it properly, the <em>hametz</em> sale will certainly protect him from violating any prohibition. Even though he
            sold his <em>hametz</em>, if he finds the <em>hametz</em> on Pesah he is permitted to burn it. This is not considered stealing from the gentile,
            since he is not causing the gentile any monetary loss. However, it seems to me that it is better not to sell all the <em>hametz</em> that one has
            in his possession, since this makes the whole sale look fictitious, because every buyer wants to know where his purchase is without having to look
            for it all over the house. Therefore, one must decide where to place his <em>hametz</em>, and it is preferable to specify the location in the
            authorization contract. Regarding <em>hametz</em> that may have remained in the house, <em>bitul </em>is sufficient.

            10:14 and 11:9 and in the notes states that the sale of <em>hametz gamur</em> should be limited to owners of large businesses, but individuals must
            take care, as much as possible, to only sell uncertain <em>hametz</em>. So states <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 8:9.

        <p>
According to the letter of the law, every individual has the right to rely on the sale, since the sale is valid according to the majority of            <em>poskim</em>. Even if the seller feels that the sale is somewhat fictitious, if the gentile wishes to do so, he could take the seller to court
            and legally claim the purchased <em>hametz</em>, which proves that the <em>hametz</em> indeed belongs to the gentile. Additionally, since every
            person nullifies his <em>hametz</em>, and subsequently there is no Torah prohibition on this <em>hametz</em> (there is only a rabbinic injunction
that requires destroying or selling the <em>hametz</em> in addition to <em>bitul</em>), the <em>hametz</em> assumes the status of a            <em>safek de-rabanan </em>(an uncertainly about a rabbinic prohibition). Thus, one may certainly rely on the lenient opinions that permit the sale.

            . <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:12 states that one is permitted to enter into a <em>hametz</em><em> </em>sale agreement with multiple rabbis.
            Even if each rabbi sells to a different gentile, the sale completed first takes effect. Preferably, one should not do this, since it seems
            deceitful, unless he is worried that one rabbi may not sell his <em>hametz</em>, and he wants to ensure that his <em>hametz</em> is sold one way or
            another.

        <p>
            Additionally, <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:20 states that if one was unable to sell his <em>hametz</em> due to some unavoidable reason, his
            friend may sell the <em>hametz</em> for him even without permission, since it is beneficial to the owner of the <em>hametz</em>, and one may act to
            benefit another even without permission. This is the opinion of many <em>poskim</em>, as cited in <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 448:21.

. Selling the utensils themselves to a gentile is not worthwhile, since after Pesah one would be required to immerse the utensils in a<em>mikveh</em>, like any eating implement bought from a gentile (<em>Hatam Sofer </em>OH <em> �</em>109 and most <em>poskim</em>; however, AHS            <em> </em>YD 108:52, states that one may be lenient). Therefore, some <em>poskim</em> write that it is preferable to sell the <em>hametz</em> that
            is absorbed in or stuck to the utensils, as written in <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 8:18-21. It is also written that one should only sell the
            utensils that have small holes or grooves, which make them difficult to clean, and that some are careful to sell the <em>hametz</em> that is
            absorbed in these utensils. The truth is, though, that this is unnecessary, because the <em>hametz</em><em> </em>was already nullified. Even if
there is substance remaining on the utensils, as long as there is less than a <em>kezayit</em> cumulatively, according to the majority of            <em>poskim</em> there is no need to burn it (SAH 446 and <em>Kuntrus Aharon </em>1). One must store these utensils in an enclosed area so that he
            does not accidentally use them on Pesah, and after Pesah one must remove any substance that remained on the utensils before using them, because of
            the rule that one may not benefit from <em>hametz</em><em> </em>that he owned over Pesah. Preferably, in order to satisfy those who maintain that
            one is required to burn even less than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> (MA 442:12), one should remove any trace of <em>hametz</em> from the
            utensils before Pesah, or ruin the residue with detergents until they are no longer fit for a dog's consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
If this is the case, even if there is more than a <em>kezayit</em>, there is no obligation to burn it. Therefore, there is no need to sell the            <em>hametz</em> that is stuck to the utensils, and even more so one should not sell the <em>hametz</em> that is absorbed in the utensils.

            . <em>Oneg Yom Tov</em> (�36) states that we follow the location of the <em>hametz</em>. Many disagree with this ruling and maintain that the
prohibition takes effect according to the location of the owner. This is the opinion of <em>Hessed Le-Avraham </em>141:35<em>, Eretz Zvi </em>1:83            <em>, Mikra'ei Kodesh </em>Pesah<em> </em>1:55, and other <em>poskim</em><em> </em>quoted in <em>Piskei Teshuva</em> 443:1. <em>Le-khathila</em>,

            A Diaspora resident who is presently in Israel and sells his <em>hametz</em> in Israel should have in mind not to reacquire this <em>hametz</em>
            until after the festival ends in the Diaspora, as written above. Even if he did not have this intent, <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 11:35 states
            that presumably he does not want to reacquire the <em>hametz</em> before the festival ends, so he does not reacquire it until it becomes
permissible. <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh </em>Pesah 1:76 states that even if one acquired <em>hametz</em> on the eighth day of Pesah in the Diaspora, the            <em>hametz</em> may be eaten after Pesah, since there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that a Diaspora resident in Israel is not required to
            observe two days of <em>yom tov</em>. Therefore, since this is an uncertain situation on the rabbinic level, we are lenient.
