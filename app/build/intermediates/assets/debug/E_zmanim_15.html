    Chapter Fifteen: Purim and the Reading of the Megillah
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>15.1 – The Miracle of Purim</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The joy of Purim demonstrates Israel’s eternal holiness. Even though this holiness is sometimes hidden, due to our sins, it never disappears. Even when the
    Jewish people sin, they are still called God’s children, and He directs the world and arranges events for the benefit of His people, in order to save and
    redeem them.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    At the time [of the Purim story], the Jews were in dire straits. The First Temple was destroyed and Israel was exiled from its Land. True, Cyrus had
    already declared that the Jews could return home, but only a small minority [heeded his call]. The Persian Empire ruled the world, and the large Jewish
    population living throughout the Empire tried to assimilate and act as the Gentiles do, to the point where many were willing to bow down to an idol. In the
    capital city of Shushan, [many] Jews partook in Achashveirosh’s feast and looked on as [the Persians] took out the Temple vessels, which our enemies had
    pillaged at the time of the <em>Churban</em>, and used them for mundane purposes. They nevertheless took pleasure from this wicked man’s feast. It seemed
    as though the great vision for which the Jewish nation was chosen was steadily vanishing; there would no longer be hope for a return to Zion; the Jewish
    people would no longer bring the word of God to the world.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Then, a great accusation arose in heaven against Israel. Despite the fact that HaShem chose the Jews from among all the other nations, gave them His Torah,
    and planted His Shechinah (Divine Presence) in their midst, they act like the Gentiles, bow to an idol, and refuse to ascend to their Land in order to
    build the Holy Temple! Therefore, the wicked Haman, a descendant of Amalek, rose up and drove the Persian Empire to enact a frightful decree [against the
    Jews], the likes of which had never been seen before:
    <em>
        To destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, from young to old, children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month,
        which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their spoils
    </em>
    (<em>Esther</em> 3:13).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    By the way, there were Jews who contended with Mordechai, claiming that he was the cause of the evil decree: by refusing to bow to the wicked Haman, he
    stirred his wrath against all the Jews (<em>ibid</em>. 3:2-6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the end, it became clear that the Holy One, blessed be He, is the One Who arranges everything; He had already prepared the cure for the ailment, by
    having Achashveirosh take Esther [as his wife]. This way, Mordechai and Esther were able to thwart Haman’s plan, and turn everything around. Instead of
    Israel’s enemies carrying out their [evil] scheme, the Jews killed their enemies, even hanging Haman and his sons on the tree that he had prepared for
Mordechai. The Jews experienced a great salvation; their pride flourished among the nations; and they mustered the strength to ascend to    <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and settle it, eventually rebuilding the Holy Temple.

</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>15.2 – Accepting the Torah Anew</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    If we delve deeper, we will see that Haman’s decree [actually] awakened Israel’s unique inner quality (<em>segulah</em>). The decree made it clear that the
    Jews were willing to make great sacrifices in order to hold onto their faith. After all, they could have assimilated into the gentile culture and save
    themselves from annihilation. Nevertheless, they did not try to escape their Jewish destiny. On the contrary, the decree stirred them to repent and
    strengthen their faith and commitment to Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    So great was that moment that our Sages state that Israel re-accepted the Torah at the time of Achashveirosh. In a certain sense, their renewed commitment
    at that time was greater than their original acceptance of the Torah on Mt. Sinai. When the Torah was first given, the Jews accepted it forcibly, as it
    says, <em>They stood at the bottom of the mountain</em> (<em>Shemot</em> 19:17). <em>Chazal</em> comment:
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, held the mountain over them like a pail, and said, “If you accept the Torah – good; and if not – here will
    be your burial place.” R. Acha son of Ya’akov said, “This is a great declaration regarding the Torah” (i.e., a declaration of annulment, for since they
accepted the Torah under duress, they are not obligated to keep it). Rava said, “Even so, they re-accepted it at the time of Achashveirosh, as it says,    <em>The Jews</em> <em>confirmed and accepted</em> (<em>Esther</em> 9:27) – [that is], they confirmed what they had previously accepted.” (<em>Shabbat</em>
    88a)
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many [commentators] explain that [HaShem] “held the mountain [over them] like a pail” in a spiritual sense. After all the great miracles of the exodus from
    Egypt, the splitting of the sea, and the awesome revelations at Mt. Sinai, it was impossible for the Jews not to accept the Torah. However, the question
    still remained: will the Jews stay connected to HaShem and His Torah even afterwards, when they are detached from the miracles and wonders? Indeed, there
    were ups and downs, until the days of Purim arrived. That is when it became clear that <em>Am Yisrael</em>’s connection to its faith and Torah were
    absolute. The fearful decree made it clear that the price of belief might be too heavy to bear. Nevertheless, the Jews chose to adhere to their faith,
repent, and pray to God, without any coercion. Not only did they return to observe the 613 <em>mitzvot</em>, they even instituted additional    <em>mitzvot</em> after they were saved – the <em>mitzvot</em> of Purim.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This way, we were privileged to build the Second Temple, and a door was opened for the advancement of the learning of the Oral Law, which was the main
    spiritual enterprise of the Second Temple era.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>15.3 – Establishing Purim as an Everlasting Holiday </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though the joy over the salvation was great, it was initially unclear how we were to mark the event. Esther sent [a request] to the Sages, “Write me
    down for posterity,” meaning, write down the Purim story and include it in the Holy Scriptures (<em>Tanach</em>). Esther further requested, “Establish me
    for posterity,” meaning, establish the days of Purim as days of joy and reading the Megillah for future generations. At first, the Rabbis had doubts about
    this, both because it might arouse [feelings of] vengeance among the gentile nations when they see Israel rejoicing over their downfall, and also because
    they were unsure whether it was appropriate to add to the Bible another description of Israel’s war against Amalek. In the end, they found scriptural
allusions that indicate that there is room to write about the battle of Amalek once again. So, the Men of the Great Assembly composed    <em>Megillat Esther</em> (the Scroll of Esther) with <em>Ruach HaKodesh</em> (Divine Inspiration) and established Purim as an eternal holiday (Megillah 2a,
    7a; <em>Bava Batra</em> 15a).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Men of the Great Assembly (<em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>) constituted the
    <address>
        Supreme Rabbinic Court
    </address>
    that functioned at the beginning of the Second Commonwealth, and it consisted of 120 elders, including prophets and sages. Among them were Chaggai,
    Zecharyah, Malachi, Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, Azaryah, Ezra the Scribe, Nechemyah son of Chachalyah, Mordechai the Jew [of the Megillah], and Zerubavel
    son of She’altiel. Ezra the Scribe was the most prominent of all, so much so that the <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> is sometimes called Ezra’s Beit
    Din. They comprised the
    <address>
        Supreme Rabbinic Court
    </address>
    that established the first major enactments that are considered Rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em>, and they were the impetus for the continued activity of the
    Sages of the Oral Law.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Purim miracle is considered the last miracle that was allowed to be recorded in the <em>Tanach</em>, as <em>Chazal</em> state, “Esther is the end of
    all the miracles.” Thus, in effect, the writing of <em>Megillat Esther</em> sealed the <em>Tanach</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Purim is the link between the Written and Oral Laws. This is reflected in the status of its <em>mitzvot</em>, which are <em>mi’divrei kabbalah</em>, a
    category between Torah commandments and Rabbinic ones. On the one hand, they are not as exalted as <em>mitzvot</em> that are written in the Pentateuch. On
    the other hand, they are not considered Rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em>, seeing that <em>Megillat Esther</em> is included in Scriptures. The <em>Rishonim</em>
    dispute how one should act if a doubt arises regarding the laws of Purim: does the <em>halachah</em> demand that one act strictly, as in cases of Torah
    precepts, or leniently, as in cases of Rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must perform seven <em>mitzvot</em> on Purim. Four of them are unique to Purim: 1) reading the Megillah, 2) sending portions of food to one another, 3)
    giving gifts to the poor, and 4) participating in a festive meal. The remaining three are Rabbinic precepts that pertain to other holidays, as well: 1)
    reading the Torah (for men), 2) mentioning [the uniqueness of] the day by reciting <em>Al HaNissim</em> in our prayers and in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>
    (Grace After Meals), and 3) refraining from fasting and delivering eulogies.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>15.4 – Walled and Unwalled Cities </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is a very special <em>halachah</em> pertaining to Purim: it has two dates. Most places celebrate on the fourteenth of Adar, while cities that were
    surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun, as well as Achashveirosh’s capital city Shushan, celebrate on the fifteenth.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to understand the reason for this distinction, we must first remember the order of events. Haman’s decree stated that on the thirteenth of Adar
    all the enemies of Israel could destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews in the world. And the decree was not abolished even after Mordechai and Esther’s
    wondrous rise [to power], because the law stated that any decree written [in the king’s name] and sealed with the king’s signet ring could not be revoked.
    Therefore, the only thing they could do was to issue an additional edict, sealed with the king’s ring, allowing the Jews to defend themselves and kill
    their enemies.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Until the thirteenth of Adar, it was unclear how matters would develop. Granted, the Jews were already given permission to defend themselves without
    interference from the Persian army, but who knew if they would succeed in defeating their enemies? Then, on the thirteenth of Adar, a fear of the Jews
    descended upon the nations, and the Jews were able to defeat their enemies. The next day, the fourteenth of Adar, the Jews rested from battle and made it
    into a day of feasting and joy. In Shushan, the capital, however, the haters of Israel were numerous, and the Jews were unable to kill them all in one day.
    Therefore, Queen Esther came before King Achashveirosh and asked him to grant the Jews permission to take revenge against their enemies for one more day,
    which he did. So the Jews of Shushan continued eradicating their enemies on the fourteenth of Adar and rested on the fifteenth, making it into a day of
    feasting and joy.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since Purim was celebrated on two separate days from the very beginning, [the Rabbis] instituted that we bring this to light throughout the generations.
    Therefore, most places celebrate Purim on the fourteenth, while Shushan, where the miracle was greater – because all the events of the Megillah occurred
    there and the Jews took revenge against their enemies there for two days – celebrates Purim on the fifteenth. [Our Sages] also enacted that all prominent
    cities, like Shushan, celebrate on the fifteenth [as well]; and the indicator of a city’s importance is having a surrounding wall, like Shushan did.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
At that time, however,<em> Eretz Yisrael</em> was in ruins, and had they based their enactment on that time period, not one city in all of    <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> would celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar, because none of them had a wall. Therefore, in honor of the Holy Land, they decided
    that all cities surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun would celebrate Purim on the fifteenth, even if they were currently destroyed, while
    all other cities would celebrate on the fourteenth. The only exception is Shushan, the capital, for even though it was established after Yehoshua’s time,
    it celebrates on the fifteenth, since the miracle occurred there.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Today, Jerusalem is the only city that celebrates Purim on the fifteenth of Adar, because it is the only place about which we have a clear tradition that
    it was surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun. Regarding some cities it is unclear [whether or not they had a wall at that time]. There is
    even doubt about Shushan’s [exact] location. We will elaborate on these laws in chapter seventeen.

</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>15.5 – Reading the Megillah and Publicizing the Miracle </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Everyone is obligated in [the mitzvah of] reading the Megillah – men, women, and converts. One who hears someone else’s reading discharges his obligation,
    as long as he hears it from one who is obligated in the mitzvah. However, one who hears it from a minor, who is not required to keep <em>mitzvot</em>, has
    not fulfilled his obligation (<em>Sh.A.</em> 689:1-2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The main purpose of reading the Megillah is to publicize the miracle and demonstrate that HaShem runs and oversees the world, directing everything for the
    best. Even the worst troubles eventually turn around for the good. This [understanding] strengthens people’s faith [in God] and stimulates them to do more
    to reveal His name and rectify the world.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Reading the Megillah before a multitude of people in order to publicize the miracle is so important that even the <em>kohanim</em> who worked in the    <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> would delay the offering of the daily <em>Tamid</em> sacrifice in order to hear the Megillah reading in a congregation. Only
afterwards would they offer the <em>Tamid</em>. Similarly, Torah scholars who are involved in the study of Torah, and are able to hear the Megillah with a    <em>minyan</em> near their study hall, should nevertheless interrupt their learning in order to go to a synagogue and hear the Megillah together with the
    masses (Megillah 3a).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, the members of a synagogue that usually hosts several <em>minyanim</em> a day must try to gather together on Purim and hear the Megillah with a
    large number of people. However, one who is accustomed to praying in a small synagogue need not change his fixed practice in order to hear the Megillah in
a large synagogue, provided that there will be ten men at his reading (<em>Sh.A.</em> 687:2, <em>Chayei Adam</em>, <em>M.B.</em> 7,    <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 8, 10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Only as a last resort – if one is unable to hear it in a <em>minyan</em> – may one fulfill the mitzvah in private, with a blessing (<em>Sh.A.</em> and    <em>Rama</em> 690:18).
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>15.6 – When to Read the Megillah</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must read the Megillah at night and once again during the day, to commemorate the fact that the Jews cried out to God in their time of need during the
    day and at night (<em>Megillah</em> 4a; Rashi ibid.).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Megillah reading at night may be done all night – from the emergence of the stars to daybreak, while the daytime reading may be accomplished all day
    long – from sunrise (and <em>be’di’avad</em>, from daybreak) until sunset. [However], the zealous fulfill <em>mitzvot</em> promptly, reading the Megillah
    at night immediately after <em>Ma’ariv</em> and during the day immediately after <em>Shacharit</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em> 687:1, 693:1, 693:4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is forbidden to eat or sleep before reading the Megillah at night. Learning Torah, however, is permissible. One who finds it difficult to extend the
    Fast of Esther until after the Megillah reading may drink beforehand, on condition that he avoids intoxicating drinks. Similarly, one who is very hungry
may eat a casual meal before Megillah reading. That is, [he may eat] unlimited amounts of fruit and up to an egg-size of foods that require a    <em>mezonot</em> blessing (Sh.A. 232:3, <em>M.B.</em> 35, <em>Rama</em> 692:4, <em>M.A.</em> 7, <em>M</em><em>.B.</em> 14-15).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The same laws apply to the daytime reading. However, since it takes place immediately after <em>Shacharit</em>, one must [also] be careful about all the
    prohibitions that apply prior to <em>Shacharit</em>, which are more stringent. Nonetheless, one who already prayed <em>Shacharit</em> and has yet to hear
    the Megillah should not eat before fulfilling the mitzvah. Under pressing circumstances, however, one may eat a casual meal before hearing the Megillah. A
    woman, as well, may not eat before hearing the Megillah, and if she is very hungry, she may eat a snack, but not a set/full meal (<em>M.B.</em> 692:15-16.
    In time of very great need, she may ask someone to remind her [to hear the Megillah] and then she may eat a full meal before the reading).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some of the greatest <em>Rishonim</em> maintain that the primary [fulfillment of the] mitzvah of reading the Megillah and publicizing the miracle occurs
    during the day, like all the other <em>mitzvot</em> of Purim. Therefore, one must be more meticulous about the daytime reading and try even harder to read
    it in front of a multitude of people, or at least in a <em>minyan</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>15.7 – Women and Megillah Reading</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to Rashi and the Rambam, women are obligated to read or hear the Megillah the same way men are, and a woman may [therefore] read the Megillah for
    her family. In contrast, the Behag and Rabbeinu Chananel hold that a woman’s obligation is different from that of a man. Men are obligated in reading the
Megillah, while women are only obligated in hearing it. According to this opinion, a woman cannot absolve her husband of his obligation. The author of    <em>Responsa Avnei Neizer</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 511) explains that the difference stems from the fact that women need to hear the Megillah solely in order to
    publicize the miracle; therefore, they are obligated only to hear it, not read it. Men, on the other hand, are commanded not only to publicize the miracle
    but also to remember Amalek in order to inspire themselves to eradicate [this evil nation]. Therefore, men are also obligated to read the Megillah.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Since this <em>halachah</em> is under dispute, with an equal number of <em>Rishonim</em> on each side, most <em>Acharonim</em> have determined that a woman
    should not absolve a man of his obligation to read/hear the Megillah. Only under extenuating circumstances, when a man cannot read for himself or hear it
    from another man, may a woman read the Megillah for him. This way he will [at least] fulfill the mitzvah according to those who hold that a woman can read
    on behalf of a man.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A woman may absolve other women of their obligation. However, some say that a woman may not read on behalf of many women, because the law of reading the
    Megillah for the many is like that of reading the Torah, and just as women do not read the Torah, they should also not read the Megillah for many women.
Some say that when the Megillah is read for women no blessing is recited (<em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Shannah Alef</em>, <em>TeTzaveh</em> 1;    <em>K.H.C.</em> 689:19). However, the <em>halachah</em> follows the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> who maintain that a woman may read the Megillah on
    behalf of other women, reciting the same blessing a man recites. And if ten women are present, she also recites the blessing of <em>HaRav et Riveinu</em>
    after the reading. Ideally, though, it is preferable for women to hear the Megillah from a man, in order to fulfill their obligation according to all
    opinions. Even better is for a woman to hear the Megillah in the synagogue along with the men, for the more people there are the more the miracle is
    publicized.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When a man reads the Megillah for women, the prevalent custom is for the reader to recite the blessing for everyone; and if ten are present, he recites the
    blessing of <em>HaRav et Riveinu</em> after the reading. Others follow a custom in which one woman recites the blessing for the rest. Both customs are
    valid.

</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>15.8 – Young Children </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is a mitzvah to teach children how to perform mitzvot, and from the moment a boy or girl reaches the stage at which he or she understands the Megillah
    and can listen to it as the <em>halachah</em> requires, one must teach them to do so. This matter does not depend on a child’s age, but on his or her
    personal development. And since the Megillah reading is quite long, most children reach the stage at which they can listen to the entire Megillah properly
    after the age of nine.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is a good practice to bring younger children – five or six years of age – to the synagogue to hear the Megillah. Even though they are not yet old enough
    to be educated in [the mitzvah of] Megillah reading – seeing that they cannot be careful [enough] to hear the entire thing – it is still good to bring
    them, because they understand the main gist. However, one should not bring small children to the synagogue, if they are liable to interfere [and make it
    difficult for others] to hear the Megillah. One must be careful not to be meticulous about his children’s education at the expense of the other synagogue
    attendees, who might suffer because of his children’s disturbances.
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to stimulate joy and grab the children’s attention, there is a custom for the congregation to read four verses aloud, verses that signal the
    essential beginning and end of the miracle. Afterwards, the cantor rereads them from the scroll (<em>Rama</em> 690:17; <em>M.B.</em> 689:16; based on the
Mordechai and the Levush). (The verses are: <em>A Jewish man</em> [2:5], <em>And Mordechai went out</em> [8:15], <em>For the Jews</em> [8:16], and    <em>For Mordechai</em> [10:3]).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It seems that the purpose of the custom to “smite” Haman with noisemakers is, likewise, to excite the children during the Megillah reading. However, one
must be careful not to turn the trivial into the essential and make noise when the cantor continues to read the Megillah (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:17; also see    <em>M.B.</em> 59 and <em>B.H.</em>).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>15.9 – The Megillah </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Scroll of Esther is considered one of the Holy Writings; therefore, it must be written in the way a Torah scroll is written, with black ink on
    parchment. If it is written using something other than ink, or on paper, it is invalid, and one who reads from it has not fulfilled his obligation. The
    hide [from which the parchment is made] must be processed for the sake of writing a Megillah. The [individual] sheets [of parchment] must be sown together
    with [threads made of] sinews. One must etch out the lines using an engraving tool before [commencing] the writing, so that the words come out straight.
    And it must be written by hand, having in mind the sanctity of the Megillah.
    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When writing a Torah scroll, we make sure that all of its letters are written according to their exact configurations, that no letters touch each other,
and – obviously – that no letters are left out or added. Similarly, [a scribe] should be careful [about all these things] when writing a Megillah.    <em>Be’di’avad</em>, however, there is a difference between a Torah scroll and <em>Megillat Esther</em>. The <em>halachah</em> states that one may not
recite the blessing over the reading of the Torah if the scroll contains a mistake, even in just one letter. When it comes to the Megillah, however, the    <em>halachah</em> allows one to read from a scroll that is missing a portion of its letters, if a perfectly kosher one is unavailable. For example, if a
    scribe mistakenly omitted many letters from a Megillah, or wrote them incorrectly – or if he originally wrote the scroll properly, but some of its letters
    faded over time – one may [still] use it to perform the mitzvah, as long as the essentials are written [properly]. The reason being, that the Megillah is
    called a “letter,” showing that its purpose is to tell the story from a written document, but it need not be as precise as a [Torah] scroll needs to be. We
    learn from here that one fulfills his obligation as long as the essentials of the Megillah are written properly, and on condition that one fills in the
    missing words, by reading them from a printed Megillah or saying them by heart.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the letter of the law, it is permissible to write a translation of the Megillah, with ink on parchment, for someone who does not understand
    Hebrew, and by reading this translation, he will fulfill his obligation to read the Megillah. For example, someone who knows only English may write an
    English translation of the Megillah, in ink on parchment, and read from it… (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:8-11). This is not carried out in practice, however, for we
    do not know how to translate the words precisely. Rather, [one who speaks a foreign language] fulfills his obligation by hearing the Megillah in Hebrew,
for even though he does not understand the words, he has intention to fulfill the mitzvah of Megillah reading (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:8, <em>M.B.</em> 32,    <em>A</em><em>.H.Sh.</em> 15).
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>15.10 – The Mitzvah of Reading and the Law of One Who Missed a Word </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The mitzvah of reading the Megillah [is accomplished] by reading it from a kosher Megillah, written in ink on parchment. If one recites it by heart or
    reads it from a printed book, he has not discharged his obligation (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:3). One who reads the majority from a [kosher] Megillah and the rest
from a book or from memory has fulfilled his obligation, as long as he says the entire Megillah without missing a word (as we explained in the previous    <em>halachah</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, if the reader skips a word, or makes a mistake in one of the words – assuming that the mistake changes the meaning of the word – he has failed to
    discharge his obligation according to most <em>poskim</em>, and he must reread the Megillah properly.

    Even when the reader reads all the words properly, one of the listeners will not discharge his obligation if he fails to hear one of the words. In
    practice, this is the most important <em>halachah</em> regarding Megillah reading, because people sometimes fail to hear all of the words, due to the
    excess noise caused by the presence of children in the synagogue. This problem becomes especially acute after Haman’s name is read, for the reader
    sometimes continues reading before the children finish making noise, and those who sit in the back miss a word, causing them to forfeit the entire reading.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The solution is to immediately read the missed word or words from the printed Megillah one is using. And if, in the meantime, the reader continues to read
    ahead, [the listener who missed a word] should continue reading until he catches up with the reader. Even though the printed book in front of him is not a
    kosher Megillah, he may – <em>be’di’avad</em> – use it to fill in the missing words, seeing that has heard most of the Megillah from a kosher scroll.
    However, when listening to the [rest of] the Megillah from the reader, one should not read along with him from a printed version.

<a name="11"></a><h2>15.11 – The Laws of Reading the Megillah</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    [When not in use], it is proper to leave a Megillah rolled up from end to beginning. However, since [<em>Megillat Esther</em>] is referred to as a
    “letter,” the custom is to spread it out and fold it over, leaf over leaf, before reading it in public, in order to publicize the miracle. When the reading
    is completed, the Megillah is rolled up again from end to beginning, out of respect, so that the Megillah not remain opened. Only after the Megillah is
    rolled up does the cantor recite the blessing of <em>HaRav et Riveinu</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:17, <em>M.B.</em> 55-56, <em>K.H.C.</em> 102-105).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may fulfill the mitzvah of reading the Megillah either sitting or standing. The only one who needs to stand is the reader, out of respect for the
    congregation (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:1). Most Jews have a custom to stand for the blessings (<em>M.B.</em> 690:1; <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>TeTzaveh</em> 4;
    see also <em>K.H.C.</em> 2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The Megillah should be read with its cantillation notes, but if no one knows how to do so, it may be read without the notes, <em>be’di’avad</em> (    <em>Sha’arei Teshuvah</em> 690:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must read the Megillah in order, for if one reads it backwards – that is, in an order other than the way it is written – he does not fulfill his
    obligation. For example, if one misses a word or a verse during the reading, he should not say, “I’ll continue listening to the Megillah until the end, and
    I’ll make up what I missed afterwards.” Rather, he must immediately fill in the missing word(s), catch up to the reader, and continue listening to the
    reading, in order, until the end of the Megillah.
    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who dozes off during the Megillah reading does not discharged his obligation, for he certainly fails to hear some words (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:12). As we
    learned above (<em>halachah</em> 9), one who hears the Megillah fulfills his obligation even if he does not understand Hebrew.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Ideally (<em>le’chatchillah</em>), one should read the Megillah successively, but <em>be’di’avad</em>, if one interrupted [the reading in the middle] –
    remaining silent or even speaking – he has not forfeited what he already read and may continue reading from where he left off (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:5; also
    see <em>M.B.</em> 18 and <em>Sh.A.</em>,<em> O.C.</em> 65).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many authorities hold that one who hears the Megillah through an electronic device, like a telephone, radio, or loudspeaker, does not fulfill his
    obligation. After all, such devices receive a person’s voice as electronic signals and transform it back into a new voice. Therefore, it is like hearing a
    recording [of the Megillah reading], which is invalid. Ideally, one should heed this opinion.

</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>15.12 – The Blessings and the Order of the Reading </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We recite three blessings before the nighttime reading: “Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with His
    commandments and commanded us regarding the reading of the Megillah,” “Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who has performed miracles
    for our forefathers, in those days, at this time,” “Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who has kept us alive, sustained us, and
    brought us to this time.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The blessings prepare us for the mitzvah, for they stimulate the reader and the listeners to focus their thoughts on the fulfillment of the mitzvah and to
    understand its purpose, which is to remember and publicize the miracle that HaShem did for our ancestors. Nevertheless, one who reads without reciting a
    blessing fulfills his obligation, as long as he intends to fulfill the mitzvah (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:14).
    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
There are varying customs regarding the recital of the <em>Shehechiyanu</em> blessing during the day. The Sefardim do not say it because the    <em>Shehechiyanu</em> recited at night covers the entire day. The Ashkenazim repeat the blessing prior to the daytime reading, because that reading is a
    separate mitzvah. Moreover, it is the primary reading; therefore, it cannot be “dragged along” by the nighttime reading (<em>Sh.A.</em> 692:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When saying <em>Shehechiyanu</em> before the Megillah reading, it is proper to have in mind [that the blessing also applies to] the other <em>mitzvot</em>
    of the day: <em>Mishlo’ach Manot</em> (sending gifts of food to one another), <em>Matanot LaEvyonim</em> (giving charity), and the [festive] meal. Sefardim
    do this at night, while Ashkenazim do so during the day (<em>M.B.</em> 692:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The [prevalent] custom is to recite <em>HaRav et Riveinu</em> – a blessing of praise and thanksgiving – when the Megillah reading is over and the scroll is
    rolled back to the beginning. Most <em>poskim</em> agree that this blessing is recited only when the Megillah is read before ten men or women…

<a name="13"></a><h2>15.13 – Taking Revenge on Haman and his Ten Sons </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The killing of Haman and his ten sons is an integral part of the Megillah, for [it confirms] that justice was done and the wicked ones who rose up against
    the Jewish people were punished and killed. Anyone who rises up against Israel, God’s nation, [in effect] rises up against God, creator and sustainer of
    the world, and – according to strict justice – deserves total annihilation. Several laws demonstrate the significance of their deaths.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Firstly, we write out the [names] of Haman’s ten sons in the format of a song, but not like all other songs [in Scriptures]. In all other songs, like the
    Song at the Sea, the words and spaces are interwoven. The killing of Haman’s sons, in contrast, is written in a straight and organized fashion. One word is
written on the two ends of each line and a space is left in the middle. Thus, the names of the ten sons are written on the right side and the [Hebrew] word    <em>et</em>, which connects them, is written on the left side (<em>Megillah</em> 16b, <em>Sh.A.</em> 691:3). The explanation is [as follows]: The purpose
    of all [other] songs is to convey [the extent of] the salvation that Israel experienced; therefore, they are “spacious” and expansive. The song describing
    the killing of Haman’s sons, however, expresses the joy we feel over the fact that they were utterly destroyed and that exact justice was meted out;
    therefore, it is written in a sealed, linear style (Maharal, <em>Or Chadash</em> 9:10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must try to read all the names in a single breath, to demonstrate that they all died simultaneously. If one fails to do so, he has nonetheless
    fulfilled his obligation,<em> be’di’avad</em>. The letter <em>vav</em> in the name Vaizata is written higher than the other letters, to teach that [Haman’s
    sons] were all hanged together (<em>Megillah</em> 16b; <em>Sh.A.</em> 690:15, 691:4). The point is this: The foundation of Israel’s belief is the existence
    of one God. The Amalakites oppose this belief and hate the Jews. So, when they are annihilated, God’s oneness is revealed to the world. Therefore, when
    [Haman’s sons] were punished, they died as one, for their deaths verified the belief in God’s unity (Maharal, loc. cit.).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    After the Megillah reading, one must say, “Cursed be Haman, blessed be Mordechai; cursed be Zeresh, blessed be Esther; cursed be all the wicked ones,
    blessed be all the righteous ones; and may Charvonah be remembered for good (<em>Yerushalmi</em>, <em>Megillah</em> 3:7; <em>Sh.A.</em> 690:16).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the period of the <em>Rishonim</em>, a custom began to spread among the children, and the adults as well, to bang when Haman’s name is read. Apparently,
    they wanted to express their hatred for the wicked and their joy over their downfall. Even though there is no source for this practice, the Rama writes,
“One should not cancel or deride any custom, for it was not established for naught” (690:17). Indeed, some <em>Rishonim</em> disregard the custom, and some    <em>Acharonim</em> even come out against it, because the noise is liable to prevent the listeners from fulfilling their obligation to read/hear the
    Megillah (as explained above in sec. 10). In practice, people may continue following the custom of “hitting” Haman, as long as they make sure that everyone
    can hear the entire Megillah properly.

<a name="14"></a><h2>15.14 – Al HaNissim, Torah Reading, Eulogies, and Tachanun </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Rabbis formulated the <em>Al HaNissim</em> prayer so that we may thank HaShem for the salvation He performed for the Jewish people at the time of
Purim. We recite it in the blessing of thanksgiving in <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and in the blessing of <em>Nodeh Lecha</em> (“We thank You”) in    <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> (Grace After Meals). We do not mention Purim in the abbreviated Grace After meals [known as <em>Al HaMichyah</em>].
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If one forgets to say <em>Al HaNissim</em> in <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> or <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>, he [nonetheless] fulfills his obligation. If, however,
    he remembers before concluding the blessing in which <em>Al HaNissim</em> is inserted, he should go back and say it, unless he already said God’s name at
    the end of the blessing. [In such a situation], it is proper to say <em>Al HaNissim</em> at the end of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, after the blessings are
completed, because one is allowed to add unlimited prayers of supplication and thanksgiving at that point. Similarly, one who forgets to recite    <em>Al HaNissim</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> should say it towards the end of the prayer, together with the <em>HaRachaman</em> paragraphs, where one
    is permitted to add prayers of thanksgiving as much as he likes (Rama 682:1, <em>M.B.</em> 4).
    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who begins his meal on Purim but continues eating long into the night must say <em>Al HaNissim</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>, because the beginning
    of the meal is the determinant (<em>Sh.A.</em> 695:3; see <em>M.B.</em> 16).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Rabbis prescribed that three people be called to the Torah on Purim to read the section beginning with <em>Amalek came</em> (<em>Shemot</em> 17:8-16).
    Now, even though one of Ezra’s enactments was not to read less than ten verses from the Torah [in public], we read nine on Purim because the entire account
[of Amalek’s attack on Israel] contains only nine verses. Some have a custom to read the last verse twice in order to arrive at a total of ten verses (    <em>Sh.A.</em> 693:4), while others do not (Rama, ibid.).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This <em>halachah</em> alludes [to an interesting point]: As long as Amalek’s name has yet to be eradicated, HaShem’s name cannot be revealed fully.
    Therefore, when we read the section of “<em>Amalek came</em>,” we read [the incomplete number of] nine verses.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Even though the Jews experienced a great salvation on Purim, [the Rabbis] did not institute the recitation of Hallel on that day. The Talmud (    <em>Megillah</em> 14a) gives three reasons for this: Rabbi Yitzchak explains that we do not say Hallel on a miracle that occurred outside the Land of
    Israel. According to Rava, [the reason it is omitted] is because we remained subjugated to Achashveirosh [even after the miracle occurred], and Hallel can
    be said only over a salvation that brings us freedom. Rav Nachman holds that the reading of the Megillah is considered like Hallel; therefore, there is no
    need to prescribe the recitation of Hallel.
    <button type="button" id="1020" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 20</button>

<p dir="LTR">
    It is forbidden to deliver eulogies or fast on the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar, whether one lives in a walled or unwalled city. The only time it is
    permissible to deliver a eulogy is at the funeral of a Torah scholar, provided that the body is present (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 696:3, <em>Y.D.</em>
    401:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We omit <em>Tachanun</em> and <em>LaMinatzei’ach</em> from our prayers on both days of Purim (<em>Sh.A.</em> 693:3). We also omit <em>Tachanun</em> from
    the Minchah service of Ta’anit Esther, if it immediately precedes Purim (<em>M.B.</em> 131:33).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is customary to wear Shabbat/Yom Tov clothing on the night of Purim (<em>Rama</em> 695:2, <em>K.H.C.</em> 13).
</p>
<a name="15"></a><h2>15.15 – Working on Purim </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages did not originally establish Purim as a holiday on which work is forbidden. Over time, however, the Jewish people developed a custom, out of
    respect for the sanctity of the day, not to work; and the custom is binding. Our Sages go so far as to say that anyone who works on Purim will never see
    any blessing from it (<em>B.Y.</em>, <em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>Rama</em> 696:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, one is forbidden to go to his regular workplace on Purim. If, however, refraining from work would cause him or his employer great loss, he is
    allowed to work on Purim. It is also permissible for a pauper who has nothing to eat to work on Purim (<em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 696:2-3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is permissible to do joyous work on Purim, like preparing an apartment for a soon-to-be-married son and planting decorative trees in one’s yard. One is
    also permitted to do mitzvah-related work, like writing down novel Torah insights. It is also permissible to do light work, like writing a letter. All of
    this is allowed provided that it does not ruin ones joy or prevent one from performing the <em>mitzvot</em> of Purim (<em>Sh.A.</em> 696:1, <em>M.B.</em>
    6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Cutting nails is permitted on Purim, because it is a light task, while washing clothes by hand, sewing, and haircutting are forbidden (Ben Ish Chai,    <em>TeTzaveh</em> 21). However, one is permitted to do larger tasks if they are needed for Purim, including washing clothes by hand, sewing, and
    haircutting (<em>Rama</em> 696:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the letter of the law, one is allowed to engage in commerce on Purim, because successful transactions can bring one joy. However, it is
    fitting to act strictly in this matter, because such endeavors can drag on and take away from the joy of Purim. Therefore, it is proper to open only those
    stores that sell Purim necessities (<em>M.B.</em> 696:3, <em>A.H.S.</em> 2, <em>K.H.C.</em> 5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom of refraining from work on Purim takes effect only during the day. Granted, some <em>Acharonim</em> rule strictly and forbid work at night, as
    well. But the very fact that there is a debate regarding nighttime shows clearly that there is no accepted custom forbidding work at night. Therefore, one
    may work on the night of Purim (see <em>B.H.</em> 696:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Inhabitants of unwalled cities may work on Shushan Purim, and those of walled cities may work on the first day of Purim (<em>Sh.A.</em> 696:2).

            It emerges from Tractate Megillah, 11b-12a, that the story surrounding Achashveirosh occurred after Cyrus’ declaration, but before the Jews were
            allowed to build the Holy Temple, and that the evil decree was issued because they bowed down to an idol and derived pleasure from that wicked
            man’s feast. Many claim that Darius was Achashveirosh and Esther’s son, and thanks to her influence, Darius allowed the Second Temple to be
            completed, after the enemies of the Jews disrupted its construction. See <em>Megadim</em>, vol. 14, pp. 47-148.

            Most <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> agree that the four special <em>mitzvot</em> of Purim have the status of “<em>divrei kabbalah</em>,”
            which refers to laws that are derived from the words of the Prophets or the Writings (<em>Nach</em>), a category in between Torah and Rabbinic law.
            They [only] dispute the <em>halachah</em> regarding doubts. Seemingly, the fact that we read [the Megillah] both days in places where it is unclear
            whether they were surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun indicates that one must act strictly in cases of doubt, as we do with regard
            to Torah commandments. This appears to be the position of the Rambam and the Shulchan Aruch (688:4, 696:7). According to the Ramban, Rashba, and
            Ritva, however, we follow this practice only as a measure of piety, not as an obligation, showing that the status of [these <em>mitzvot</em>] is
like that of Rabbinic precepts. Several <em>Acharonim</em> are inclined to rule strictly (<em>Turei Zahav</em>, <em>M.B.</em> 692:16,            <em>K.H.C.</em> 39). Another discussion evolves from this question: does Megillah reading override Torah-based <em>mitzvot</em>? Most authorities,
including the Rama (687:2), hold that it does not override such <em>mitzvot</em>, but the Taz rules that it does. See Rav Zevin’s            <em>Mo’adim BeHalachah</em>, chapter <em>Chovat HaYom</em>, notes 4-16; and <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:1.

            See <em>Beit Yosef</em> 688:1; the main idea is based on the Ran, and many <em>poskim</em> – including the Mishnah Berurah – write likewise. The
            Beit Yosef himself explains that the main purpose of the distinction between the fourteenth and the fifteenth is to give honor to the Land of
            Israel and mention it on Purim. See the Maharal’s <em>Or Chadash</em> (9:11-16) for a discussion on the preeminence of the walled cities.

            Our master, Rav Kook, explains in <em>Mitzvat Re’iyah</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 688:1, that [the Sages] instituted two days of Purim in order to
            differentiate between Torah-based commandments, whose times are fixed for everyone, and Rabbinic laws, which [can] have two times, depending on
            one’s location. Perhaps this is [also] why they established different levels of <em>Mehadrin</em> with regard to [lighting] the Chanukah candles.
            And since we find a distinction in the Torah between walled and unwalled cities (<em>VaYikra</em> 25:29; <em>Keilim</em> 1:7), they made this same
            distinction on Purim. And since all laws in the Torah relating to walled cities apply only in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, they instituted [the Purim
            holiday] according to the time period in which [these laws] began – when the Jews entered the Land at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun. [The Rav]
            elaborates; see there.

            When several people need to fulfill the mitzvah, but they constitute less than a <em>minyan</em>, it is preferable for each one to read by himself,
            because reading the Megillah is, <em>le’chatchillah</em> (ideally), like prayer, in which the leader absolves the congregation of their duty, while
            an individual cannot not absolve his fellow. <em>Be’di’avad</em> (when the ideal situation is unattainable), however, an individual may absolve his
            fellow of his obligation (<em>Sh.A.</em> 689:5, <em>M.B.</em> 15). If only one person knows how to read the Megillah with the cantillation notes,
            it is preferable for him to read on behalf of his fellow, despite the fact that there are less than ten men present.

            [The Talmud records a dispute] in Tractate <em>Megillah</em> 5a: Rav holds that when <em>Megillat Esther</em> is read in its proper time, it may be
            read even in private, while Rav Assi maintains that a <em>minyan</em> is required even if it is read in its proper time. The <em>Rishonim</em>
argue [over this Talmudic] debate: Rabbeinu Tam understands it to be concerned with the ideal situation (<em>le’chatchillah</em>), and the            <em>halachah</em> follows Rav’s opinion. Therefore, one may read the Megillah in private, in its proper time – <em>le’chatchillah</em> (but it is
clearly preferable to read it with a large group of people). The Behag (<em>Ba’al Halachot Gedolot</em>) believes that the argument concerns the            <em>be’di’avad</em> situation, and the <em>halachah</em> follows Rav Assi’s viewpoint. Therefore, one should not read it in private. Those who
            regard his opinion hold that an individual should read it without reciting a blessing (the Mordechai quoting Rabbeinu Gershom writes in this vein,
            as does Mahari Weill). Many <em>Rishonim</em> maintain that one should ideally read the Megillah with a <em>minyan</em>, but that this is not
            crucial; either because the <em>halachah</em> follows Rav Assi’s opinion, and he agrees that one may read it in private,<em> be’di’avad</em>, or
            because the <em>halachah</em> follows Rav’s opinion, and he agrees that one should ideally read it with a <em>minyan</em>. The Rosh and Ra’avad
            hold this position, and it is codified in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (690:18). The vast majority of <em>Acharonim</em> agree that one who reads it
            in private should recite the blessing. See <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, vol. 1, <em>O.C.</em> 44. The author of <em>Orchot Chayim</em> quotes the Ra’avad
            as saying that if the Megillah was read in front of ten men in a certain place, an individual may read it alone <em>le’chatchillah</em>, for the
            miracle has already been publicized. The Rama (690:18) concurs. The Mishnah Berurah (64) writes that there are those who rule strictly and require
            an individual to search for ten [men], <em>le’chatchillah</em>, even in this situation. See [below], footnote 8, regarding women reading and
            reciting the blessing for other women. Also see footnote 17, on the issue of a <em>minyan</em> for the blessing of “<em>HaRav et Riveinu</em>”
            (according to the Ben Ish Chai, one recites the blessing even without a <em>minyan</em>, but the prevalent custom is not to say it. Ten women
            recite the blessing).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
According to the Rif, Rashba, and Ramban, one should not read the Megillah on a day other than the proper day (11-13 Adar), unless there is a<em>minyan</em>. Rashi and R. Zerachyah HaLevi (Razah), however, hold that one may read it and recite the blessing, <em>be’di’avad</em>, without a<em>minyan</em>. In practice, the author of <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> (690:61) writes that one who reads it before the proper day without a            <em>minyan</em> should not recite the blessing.

            See Megillah 4a with <em>Birur Halachah</em>. Tosafot and the Rosh write (ibid.) that the daytime reading is the main one and it publicizes the
            miracle the most. According to the Ran, the villagers who read earlier – on the “assembly day” [i.e., the Monday or Thursday before Purim] – do not
            have to read the Megillah at night at all. The Rashba and the Ritva believe that the enactment was for the villagers to read on the “assembly day”
with a <em>minyan</em>, while they would read it at night in their hometowns, without a <em>minyan</em>. The only point about which [these two            <em>Rishonim</em>] argue is which night the villagers would read: the Rashba holds they would read on the night before the “assembly day,” while
the Ritva maintains that they would read on the night of Purim [itself]. The authors of <em>Noda BeYehudah</em> (first edition 41) and            <em>Turei Even</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 4a) write that the daytime reading was enacted by the prophets (<em>mi’divrei kabbalah</em>) while the
            nighttime reading is merely a rabbinic decree. [R. Ovadyah Yosef] suggests in <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (<em>O.C.</em> vol. 1, 43:13) that the Ohel
Mo’ed, Or Zaru’a, and Ran share this opinion. However, according to the Roke’ach, Rashba, and Ritva, the nighttime obligation is also            <em>mi’divrei kabbalah</em> (a <em>minyan</em> is nevertheless not required at night, because the miracle is publicized primarily during the day).
            The Rambam and Shulchan Aruch seemingly hold that there is no difference between the nighttime and daytime obligations.

            </a>
            The author of <em>Turei Even</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 4a) writes that a man’s obligation stems from <em>Ruach HaKodesh</em> (Divine Inspiration
            [with which the “Writings,” including the Book of Esther, were written]) and applies only to men, as a time-bound mitzvah. Women, on the other
            hand, are obligated solely because “they, too, were involved in the miracle,” which is only a Rabbinic obligation. Thus, according to the Behag and
            Rabbeinu Chananel, a woman cannot absolve a man of his obligation. The Ra’avyah and the Roke’ach concur, and this can also be inferred from Tosafot
            and the Ran. The Mordechai writes that according to this viewpoint, women recite a different blessing – “…to hear the Megillah.” However, Rashi,
            the Rambam, the Nimukei Yosef, the Or Zaru’a, Ri’az (R. Yeshayah Acharon <em>z”l</em>), the Meiri, and others hold that a woman’s obligation is
            identical to that of a man. Therefore, women can absolve men of their obligation, and they recite the same blessing as men do.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some say that women have the same obligation as men do, but they cannot absolve them of their obligation for another reason. The Smag states that
            it is because [reading the Megillah] is like reading the Torah. The Magen Avraham (689:5) explains this to mean that [the Rabbis] determined that
            women should not read, out of respect for the congregation, and that they cannot even absolve an individual man, so as not to make any
            distinctions. According to the Kol Bo, women should not read for men because women’s voices are considered <em>ervah</em> (erotic). With regard to
            those who hold that women may read on behalf of men, perhaps we can explain that they were referring to relatives, for whom one need not be so
            concerned about “a woman’s voice is <em>ervah</em>.” Alternatively, [if a woman reads for a man] she would read without notes. Another possibility:
according to the letter of the law, we are not concerned about “a woman’s voice is <em>ervah</em>” when dealing with mitzvah observance. See            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, <em>Mo’adim</em>, p. 289, for sources that support this viewpoint.

            Some <em>Acharonim</em> infer from [the words of] the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (689:1-2) that a woman may absolve a man of his obligation, and they
            rule accordingly (<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 271:1, <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em> 689:2). The author of <em>Chazon Ovadyah</em> (<em>Purim</em>, p. 59)
            writes that even though the <em>halachah</em> follows the more lenient opinion, one should not rely on it unless there is a pressing need. The
majority of <em>Acharonim</em>, however, maintain that a woman may not read on behalf of a man – <em>Levush</em>, <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> (689:2),            <em>Pri Chadash</em> (1), <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> (3), <em>Chikrei Lev</em>, and <em>Derech HaChayim</em>. Some say that this is also the
            Shulchan Aruch’s position (<em>Pri Megadim</em>, <em>Eshel Avraham</em> 4; also see <em>K.H.C.</em> 14).

            </a>
            The author of <em>Korban Netanel</em> (on the Rosh, <em>Megillah</em>, 1:4, sec. 40) writes a novel idea: a woman may not read on behalf of many
            [other] women. Although the author of <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> (689:15) quotes this, it seems that he means only that one should, ideally, act
            strictly [on the matter], for he writes in section 16 that the accepted opinion holds that a woman’s obligation is equal to that of a man. The
            author of <em>Halichot Beitah</em> (<em>Petach HaBayit</em> 25) relates that R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 19, note 4)
            questions the Korban Netanel’s notion and concludes that the <em>halachah</em> follows R. Tikotchinsky’s ruling, found in his <em>Luach</em>
            (calendar) <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, that a woman may absolve many women of their obligation. The logic behind the viewpoint that no blessing is
            recited when reading for women is that we take into account the opinion that holds that no blessing is recited for an individual (above, note 4),
            and women have the same status as an individual (<em>K.H.C.</em> 689:19). Most authorities maintain that one need not worry about this at all; as
            is written in <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 1:44; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em>, pp. 156-57; and <em>Halichot Beitah</em> 24:6. However, it seems
            obvious that women are enjoined to hear the Megillah in the company of a multitude of people; they are simply not obligated to the same degree as
men are, for the same reason that women are exempt from time-bound positive commandments and praying in a <em>minyan</em>. See            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 689:1.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to the Rama (689:2), when a woman recites the blessing, she should say, “…to hear the Megillah.” The Levush, Bach, and Mishnah Berurah
            (692:11) agree. However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that a woman blesses just like a man does: “…on the reading of the Megillah.” First of all,
            half of the <em>poskim</em> hold like Rashi and the Rambam who say that a woman’s obligation is equal to that of a man. Second, even according to
            the Behag and Rabbeinu Chananel, who say that a woman is obligated only to hear the Megillah, nonetheless, Rabbeinu Tam holds – and such is
            Ashkenazi custom – that women are allowed to fulfill mitzvot [that they are officially exempt from] and recite blessings over them, just like men
            do. Therefore, it is possible that no distinction needs to be made between the formulation of the men’s blessing and that of women. Most Sefardim
            follow this custom, and the Pri Chadash and the Gra concur. See also <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 689:5.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Talmud states in <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 29a, “Even though one has already discharged his obligation, he may absolve others of theirs.” That is,
            even one who has already performed a mitzvah and recited a blessing over it may recite a blessing on behalf of someone who has not yet fulfilled
            his obligation. According to the Behag and the Rambam, this holds true only when the one who still needs to do the mitzvah does not know how to
            recite the blessing. If he knows how to recite the blessing, however, he should do so himself. The Or Zaru’a and the Ran, on the other hand,
            believe that one may recite a blessing even on behalf of someone who knows how to do so himself. [The answer to] the question as to whether it is
            better for one of the woman to recite the blessing [as opposed to the reader] depends on this dispute. The Bi’ur Halachah (273:4) explains that the
            dispute concerns only the <em>le’chatchillah</em> (ideal) situation. On a simple level, it is preferable for one of the women to recite the
blessing on behalf of all the rest, for this covers all the variant opinions. The authors of <em>Luach Eretz Yisrael</em> and            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> (19:3) [advocate this solution]. In many [communities], however, the reader recites the blessing, as the Mishnah Berurah
            writes in 585:5, regarding <em>shofar</em> blowing, and in 692:10, on the issue of women reading the Megillah. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:15,
            pp. 162-64. The author of <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> (vol. 3, 54:38) writes – based on [an <em>halachah</em>] in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 689:5 and
            based on what we explained in note 4, above – that if there are less than ten women, it is better for each one to recite her own blessing.

The Shulchan Aruch (689:1) explains the obligation of children [to hear the Megillah] as an offshoot of <em>chinuch</em> (education). In the sixth<em>halachah</em> of that section, he writes that it is good to bring them to the synagogue. The Levush and R. Ya’akov Emden (            <em>Siddur Ya’avetz</em>) seem to hold that this refers to children who understand the main gist [of the Megillah], even though they cannot fulfill
            the mitzvah according to the letter of the law. For example, they cannot fill in words that they failed to hear from the reader. And even though
            the Bi’ur Halachah interprets [the Shulchan Aruch’s statement] differently, there seems to be no practical difference between [his words and] what
            I wrote. See also <em>M.B.</em> 689:16-18; <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7, 1*, 17; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 689:8; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:10.

            A Megillah has the same status as a Torah scroll, as is clear from the <em>Mishnah</em> and <em>Gemara</em> in Tractate <em>Megillah</em> (17a,
19a). One may write a Megillah on both whole parchment (<em>g’vil</em>) and split parchment (<em>k’laf</em>), but the custom is to write it on            <em>k’laf</em> [which is of superior quality]. According to the Rambam, there is no requirement to process the parchment <em>lishmah</em> – for the
sake [of the mitzvah] – but the Rosh and the majority of <em>poskim</em> require <em>lishmah</em> (<em>B.Y.</em> and <em>Sh.A.</em> 691:1). The<em>Acharonim</em> debate whether a woman may write a Megillah. The authors of <em>Birkei Yosef</em>, <em>Mateh Yehudah</em>, and            <em>Pri Megadim</em> posit that since a woman is obligated to read the Megillah, she is allowed to write one. Rabbi Akiva Eiger, the Avnei Neizer,
and others maintain that she is disqualified from writing a Megillah, just as she is disqualified from writing a Torah scroll.            <em>Lishkat HaSofer</em> (28:7, by R. Shlomo Ganzfried, author of <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em>) brings a support for those who permit a woman [to
            write a Megillah] from the verse <em>And Esther wrote</em> (<em>Esther</em> 9:29), the source from which the Talmud (<em>Megillah</em> 19a) derives
            the law that [a Megillah] has to be written like a Torah scroll. He concludes that ideally (<em>le’chatchillah</em>) one should use a Megillah that
            was written by a man, in order to satisfy all opinions. <em>Be’di’avad</em>, however, when the only available Megillah was written by a woman, one
            may read from it and [even] recite the blessings over it.

            The rule is that one fulfills his obligation, <em>be’di’avad</em>, if he reads from a Megillah of which at least half is written properly, provided
            that no theme is entirely missing and that the beginning and end are in tact (<em>Sh.A.</em> 690:3).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some say that if [the scribe] writes some of the words in a foreign language, the Megillah is invalid, because it is like [a document that is]
            internally adulterated. The author of <em>Mateh Yehudah</em> and R. Shlomo Kluger hold that a Megillah is disqualified from use if letters are
            missing or added in a way that changes the meaning [of a verse], because it, too, is like [a document that is] internally adulterated. In practice,
            though, most authorities maintain that mistakes do not invalidate [a Megillah] any more than erased letters do, as the Mishnah Berurah explains in
            chapter 691, sections 6 and 14. See also <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> 690:8, regarding the alternative opinion (<em>yeish omrim</em>) and the Ritva.
            Also see <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 11, 14:17.

        <p dir="LTR">
            One should not write vowels, cantillation marks, or blessings in the Megillah, but <em>be’di’avad</em> – when no other scroll is available – one
            may read from such a Megillah and [even] recite a blessing over it (<em>Sh.A.</em> 691:9). A Torah scroll, however, is invalid if vowels and
            cantillation marks are written inside (<em>Sh.A.</em>,<em> Y.D.</em> 274:7). There is a stringency regarding the public reading of the Megillah:
            one fails to fulfill his obligation if he reads from a Megillah that is attached to other books of Scriptures, because the miracle is not
            publicized this way, for it looks like one is [merely] reading from Scriptures. An individual, however, discharges his obligation when reading from
            such a Megillah (<em>Sh.A.</em> 691:8).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some authorities rule very leniently and allow one to read from an invalid Megillah (like the ones children use, which open like a scroll) with a
            blessing, if no kosher Megillah is available (Roke’ach, Orchot Chayim). According to most <em>poskim</em>, however, it is absolutely forbidden to
            recite a blessing on such a Megillah. Nonetheless, it is proper to read from it without a blessing (<em>Sh.A.</em> 691:10). The Mishnah Berurah
            (26) adds that even if one has only a printed Megillah, in book form, he should read from it, so as not to forget its message.

            The Rashba and the Ran maintain that one does not fulfill his obligation if he skips a word. The Riaz (R. Yeshayah Acharon <em>z”l</em>) disagrees
if [the missing word] does not affect the meaning [of the verse]. If one reads a word incorrectly, in a way that changes its meaning – like            <em>nafal</em> (fell) instead of <em>nofel</em> (had fallen) – the Rashba, the Ran, and the Orchot Chayim hold that he has not discharged his
            obligation, while it seems from the Tur and Shulchan Aruch (690:14) that there are those who believe that he has done the mitzvah. This might be
            the Rambam’s opinion. The Aruch HaShulchan (690:20) writes that if, <em>be’di’avad</em>, [the listeners] did not make him reread the word, he has
            fulfilled his obligation. In practice, most <em>poskim</em> hold that he has not fulfilled the mitzvah in either case, and he must to reread the
            Megillah; see <em>M.B.</em> 690:5 and <em>B.H.</em> 690:14. Everyone agrees that one must reread it if he skipped a word that affects the meaning
            [of the verse]. See also <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:26 and 28; <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 12:7.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In my humble opinion, if [the reader made] a mistake [that affects the meaning of the verse but] most people do not understand the difference in
            meaning, he does not have to reread [the Megillah], <em>be’di’avad</em> (ex post facto), because [the listeners] did not misunderstand the meaning
            anyway.

Some have a custom to read certain words twice because of uncertainty regarding [their correct reading]. For example: <em>ke’omram</em> /            <em>be’omram</em> (3:4), <em>laharog</em> / <em>ve’laharog</em> (8:11), <em>bifneihem</em> / <em>lifneihem</em> (9:2). One fulfills the mitzvah
            even without doing so. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:38 and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 690:3.

            Those who observe <em>mitzvot</em> meticulously purchase a kosher Megillah, from which they can fill in any words they may miss. This way, they
            fulfill the mitzvah <em>le’mehadrin</em> – in the best possible manner (<em>M.B.</em> 689:19). However, one who does not know how to vocalize [the
            words] properly does more harm than good [by reading from his own Megillah]. After all, we already learned that a mistake that affects the meaning
            of a word invalidates the reading. The Shulchan Aruch (690:4) and Mishnah Berurah (13) explain why a listener should not read [along with the
            reader] from a printed Megillah.

            One who comes late to the synagogue and finds that the congregation has already begun reading the Megillah should not say, “I’ll listen to the
            Megillah and make up the first few verses afterwards,” for that constitutes reading it backwards. Rather, if he fears that he will not be able to
            hear it again later, he should quickly recite the blessings, begin reading from a printed Megillah until he catches up to the reader, and hear the
            rest from him. This will work only if he hears most of the Megillah from the reader. If, however, he fears that by the time he finds the
            formulation of the blessings [and recites them], the reader will advance to such an extent that he will not be able to catch up to him before
            midway through the Megillah – and he will not be able to fulfill the mitzvah any other way – he is better off skipping the blessings. This way, he
            will have enough time to catch up to the reader before the half-way mark and fulfill the mitzvah (see <em>B.H.</em> 690:3, s.v. <em>ve’davka</em>).

See <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Berachot</em> 12:10, [where we cited] a dispute among the <em>poskim</em> regarding this issue. Rav Kook (            <em>Orach Mishpat</em> 48) and Rav Frank (<em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> 11) maintain that one discharges his obligation [by way of an electronic
            device]. [Rav Moshe Feinstein] also tends towards this viewpoint in <em>Iggrot Moshe</em> (<em>O.C.</em> vol. 2, 108 and vol. 4, 91:4). On the
            other hand, the authors of <em>Mishpatei Uziel</em>, <em>Minchat Shlomo</em> (1:9), and <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> (3:54) hold that one does not
            fulfill his obligation [in this way]. <em>Le’chatchillah</em>, one should avoid using electronic devices to discharge his obligation, but if there
            is no choice, one can rely on the more lenient authorities and fulfill the mitzvah at least according to their opinion.

            The <em>Rishonim</em> debate whether or not<em> mitzvot</em> require intent. The Shulchan Aruch (<em>O.C.</em> 60:4, 690:13-14) settles the matter
and rules that one must perform a mitzvah with intent to fulfill God’s command. Many <em>Acharonim</em> hold that this applies to Rabbinic            <em>mitzvot</em>, as well, [meaning that] one does not discharge his obligation without intent. Ideally, one should have this intent in mind
            explicitly, but even if he does not, he is still considered to have performed the mitzvah with intent if he would answer the question “Why did you
            just read the Megillah?” by saying, “To fulfill the mitzvah,” as the Mishnah Berurah (60:10) explains. Therefore, anyone who comes to synagogue for
            Megillah reading or recites a blessing before reading the Megillah clearly has intention to fulfill the mitzvah and discharges his obligation. Only
            someone who sits at home and hears the reading from a synagogue fails to discharge his obligation, unless he explicitly intends to fulfill the
            mitzvah.

            In contrast to the blessings we recite before the reading, <em>HaRav et Riveinu</em> is not obligatory. Rather, it is a blessing of praise and
            thanksgiving, which depends on custom, as the <em>Mishnah</em> states, “In a place where the custom is to recite the blessing, one should recite
            it, [and in a place where the custom is] not to recite the blessing, one should not recite it” (<em>Megillah</em> 21a). Nowadays, everyone recites
            it. The author of <em>Orchot Chayim</em> quotes the <em>Yerushalmi</em> as saying that one recites it only in a <em>minyan</em>, and the Beit Yosef
and Rama codify this in 692:1. However, Rashi, the Maharam, and the Radvaz hold that even an individual recites it. The Ben Ish Chai (<em>TeTzaveh</em> 13) concurs, and those who follow his decisions act accordingly. The authors of <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> (692:2) and            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (O.C. 8:56) write that one should not recite the blessing [unless a <em>minyan</em> is present], because the issue is
            unsettled. (This [decision] is especially [logical] seeing that the Behag and Mahari Weill hold that an individual omits even the first [three]
            blessings.) The prevalent custom is not to say it [when reading the Megillah] alone, but one should not rebuke those who want to recite it. It is
            unclear whether women count towards the ten (Rama 690:18). The Pri Chadash and Pri Megadim write that this uncertainty relates only to [the
            question of whether women can be counted] together with men, but a <em>minyan</em> [of ten] women [certainly] recites the blessing. Although some
have a custom not to say it, the <em>halachah</em> follows [those who maintain] that it should be said in [a group of] ten women, as the authors of            <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> (Frank, <em>Purim</em> 35) and <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (vol. 8, O.C. 56:4) write. See also <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 692:4. It
            seems that, in practice, women can also be counted together with men, <em>be’di’avad</em>, since many [authorities] hold that even one person may
            recite this blessing. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:14 and <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 1-4.

This custom is more prevalent in Ashkenazi communities. However, the Maharil did not follow it. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:10 and            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 12:16. In our community [of Har Berachah], we conduct two <em>minyanim</em> on Purim night. The yeshiva students
            [remain in the yeshiva and] “beat” Haman extensively, while [the townspeople congregate] in the synagogue and bang once with their feet, causing
almost no delays. During the day, we read the Megillah together in the yeshiva, in large numbers, and [people] bang minimally. (See above,            <em>halachah</em> 6, note 5, [where we cited] authorities who say that [the requirement] to read the Megillah in front of a multitude of people is
            primarily accomplished during the day.)

            The laws of <em>Al HaNissim</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> prayer are the same for Purim and Chanukah, as the Shulchan Aruch and Rama elucidate (693:2
and 682:1). We elaborated above, 11:8. There is, however, a difference when it comes to <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>. On Chanukah, reciting            <em>Al HaNissim</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> is based on custom, while reciting it on Purim is obligatory. Some claim that one who forgets to
            say <em>Al HaNissim</em> at the Purim meal, during the day, must repeat <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>, for one is obligated to eat the Purim meal over
            bread (Maharshal, Shelah, Taz). Others hold that one need not repeat the prayer, because there is no obligation to eat bread at the meal (Terumat
            HaDeshen, Magen Avraham, Eliyah Rabbah). Still others maintain that even though one must eat bread at the meal, the law of <em>Al HaNissim</em> at
            the meal is no more stringent than that of <em>Al HaNissim</em> in <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, for which one need not repeat the prayer (Aruch
            HaShulchan 695:7, 12). The Mishnah Berurah (695:15) concludes that one should not repeat <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> because we [generally] rule
            leniently in cases of doubt regarding blessings.

            The Meiri and the Manhig write that according to the answer that the reading of the Megillah is in place of Hallel, one who cannot obtain a
            Megillah from which to read on Purim must recite the Hallel [instead]. The Rambam (3:6) also seems to hold that this reason is the main one.
            However, some [authorities] write that the other answers are primary. [Therefore], one who does not have a Megillah should, <em>le’chatchillah</em>
            , say Hallel without a blessing, in order to satisfy all the opinions. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 5:41.
