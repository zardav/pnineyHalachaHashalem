    Chapter Sixteen: <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Significance of the <em>Berachot</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of three <em>berachot</em> with <em>Keriat Shema</em> of <em>Shacharit</em>, two before the <em>Shema</em>
    and one after it (<em>Mishnah</em>,<em> Berachot</em> 11a). These <em>berachot</em> add to the content of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, including praise and
    thanksgiving to Hashem for creating and ruling over the world.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Keriat Shema</em> we say "<em>Hashem Echad</em>" ("Hashem is One"), denoting that He is the single entity that constitutes and fills the whole world
    with His oneness. In the first <em>berachah</em> of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, we expand on this foundation. By praising Him for the light that is renewed
    daily, we extol Hashem, "Who constantly renews the events of creation every day." In order to emphasize His all-encompassing domain, we mention that He
    also created the darkness. At night, in the parallel <em>berachah</em>, together with the praise that He is "<em>Ma'ariv aravim</em>" ("the One Who brings
    on evening"), we add that he is "<em>Borei yom valaylah</em>" ("the Creator of day and night"). Hence, in the first <em>berachah</em>, our belief in God's
    unity is given more expanded expression.
</p>
<p>
    Opening with the words "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" ("Hear O Israel") expresses our belief that God's unity is revealed to the world via the nation of Israel,
    which was expressly created for that purpose. This idea is expanded upon in the second <em>berachah</em>, in which we thank Hashem for the love that He
    feels for us and for giving us the Torah. We pray that we merit understanding the Torah and fulfill it with love, thereby revealing Hashem's Name in the
    world.
</p>
<p>
    "<em>Hashem Elokeinu</em>" ("Hashem our God") means that Hashem is omnipotent and rules over the world according to His will. His control of the world,
    with all its forces and components, was revealed most clearly in the exodus from Egypt, which is mentioned at the end of <em>Keriat Shema</em>. This, too,
    is revealed through the nation of Israel. In the third <em>berachah</em> we expand on this foundation and praise Hashem, "You are the first and You are the
    last, and aside from You we have no king, redeemer, or savior. From Egypt You redeemed us..." Additionally, we mention the slaying of the firstborn in Egypt
    and the splitting of the Sea. We then conclude, "Blessed are You, Hashem, Who redeems Israel."
</p>
<p>
We see, therefore, that all three <em>berachot</em> are a continuation of, and an expansion on, the foundations of faith that are found in    <em>Keriat Shema</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Although the proper order that the <em>Chachamim</em> established is to say <em>Keriat Shema</em> with its <em>berachot</em>, nevertheless, one's neglect
    to recite one of them does not prevent him from fulfilling the mitzvah of the other. If a person recites <em>Shema</em> without its <em>berachot</em> he
    still fulfills the mitzvah of <em>Keriat Shema,</em> and if he recites the <em>berachot</em> without saying <em>Keriat Shema</em> he still fulfills the
    mitzvah of reciting the <em>berachot</em>. Similarly, one's neglect to recite one <em>berachah</em> does not hamper the recital of the others. Therefore,
if a person recites one of the <em>berachot</em>, he fulfills his obligation over the blessing which he recites. All the more so, reciting the<em>berachot</em> in the wrong order does not prevent one from fulfilling his obligation to say them, so if someone mistakenly recites the second    <em>berachah</em> before the first, he still fulfills his obligation. However, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, one must recite all the <em>berachot</em> together in
    the order that the <em>Chachamim</em> established. <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>

    <em>2. </em>
    The Link between <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>
</h2>
<p>
Upon the conclusion of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Yishtabach</em>, the <em>chazan</em> recites Half-<em>Kaddish</em>. As we know, the virtue of the    <em>Kaddish</em> is very great, and the <em>Chachamim</em> praise those who respond <em>Amen</em> to it with <em>kavanah</em> (see further in this book
    23:6). The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted its recital at the conclusion of every stage of the prayer service in order to end each step in supreme sanctity,
    and from that holiness to continue on to the next stage of prayer. This Half-<em>Kaddish</em> creates a break between <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>
    (corresponding to the world of <em>yetzirah</em>) and <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> (which correspond to the world of <em>beriah</em>).
</p>
<p>
One may not interrupt by speaking between <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. Someone who does interrupt commits a sin, since    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> serves as a preparation for prayer (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 54:3).
</p>
<p>
If a group of people praying reaches the end of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and they do not yet have a <em>minyan</em>, they should stop after    <em>Yishtabach</em> and wait for a <em>minyan</em>. They may learn Torah in the meantime. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, they should study silently, so they do not
    interrupt their prayer by speaking. However, one who cannot learn without actually uttering the words may learn by saying them, since, for the sake of a
    mitzvah, it is permissible to interrupt between <em>Yishtabach</em> and <em>Barchu</em>. The <em>chazan</em> should wait before <em>Yishtabach</em> for ten
    men to assemble so that he can say <em>Yishtabach</em>, and afterwards, Half-<em>Kaddish</em>. If he already concluded <em>Yishtabach</em>, after ten men
have already gathered he should recite three verses of Scripture so that the <em>Kaddish</em> will apply to them and subsequently recite Half-    <em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 53:10-11).
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>gabbai</em> must relay an urgent message to the congregation, either pertaining to the needs of the community or for the sake of a mitzvah,
    and it is impossible to delay the announcement until after the prayer service, he may announce it between <em>Yishtabach</em> and <em>Kaddish.</em>
    Afterwards, the <em>chazan</em> recites a few verses and <em>Kaddish</em>. However, if the<em> Kaddish </em>was already recited, it is forbidden to
interrupt even for the sake of a mitzvah, and he must wait until after <em>Kaddish titkabal</em> to make the announcements (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,    <em> Rama</em> 54:3; 57:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 54:6).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. <em>Barchu</em>
</h2>
<p>
After the <em>Kaddish</em>, the <em>chazan</em> says, "<em>Barchu et Hashem hamevorach</em>" ("Bless Hashem Who is blessed"). The congregation responds, "    <em>Baruch Hashem hamevorach l'olam va'ed</em>" ("Blessed is Hashem, Who is blessed for all eternity"), and the <em>chazan</em> repeats the congregation's
    line, saying, "<em>Baruch Hashem hamevorach l'olam va'ed</em>" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 57:1).
</p>
<p>
    The primary purpose of <em>Barchu</em> is to introduce <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, for by declaring "<em>Barchu</em>," the <em>chazan</em> invites the
    congregation to recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. Even though it can also be recited as praise in itself, like when <em>Barchu</em> is recited at the
    conclusion of the prayer service, nevertheless, the essence of its establishment was to introduce <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. Therefore, every person
must finish saying <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Yishtabach</em> before <em>Barchu</em> so that immediately after <em>Barchu</em> he can begin    <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. It is best to even skip <em>Az Yashir</em> in order to start <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> with the congregation. Still,
whoever did not yet succeed in saying the <em>berachah</em> of <em>Yishtabach</em>, even if he already responded to <em>Barchu</em>, must conclude    <em>Yishtabach</em> and only afterwards continue with <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
There are varying customs with regard to standing when responding to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu.</em> According to the <em>minhag</em> of most<em>Sephardim</em>, there is no need to stand up while answering matters of sanctity, but one who is already standing must remain that way for    <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em> (<em>Maharil</em>, <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 56:20; 146:20-21; <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 3:4). Most <em>Ashkenazim</em> are
    accustomed to standing while responding to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em> which are matters of sanctity (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 54:7-8; 146:18).
    However, concerning <em>Barchu</em> which requires a short answer, many <em>Ashkenazim</em> have the custom that if they are already sitting, such as for
    Torah reading, or before <em>Ma'ariv</em>, they do not completely stand up, rather they only rise slightly from their chairs when responding. This is
    similar to the custom many people have when answering a <em>zimun</em> with ten men.
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>chazan</em> says the word "<em>Barchu</em>" he bows a bit, and when saying "Hashem" he straightens himself. Regarding the congregation, there
    are different customs. There are those accustomed to bowing down completely, those who bow slightly, and those who don't bow at all. Every person should
    follow his family's <em>minhag</em>. When people with different <em>minhagim</em> pray together, it is proper that everyone bows slightly (see further in
    this book chapter 17, note 3).

    4. <em>Kedushat Yotzer</em> and Responding <em>Amen</em> to the <em>Berachot </em>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Birkat</em>
    <em>Yotzer Or</em>
    is praise to Hashem, "Who constantly renews the acts of creation daily." Over time, liturgy was added to this <em>berachah</em>; there is a special poem
    for weekdays and a special poem for Shabbat. Not only do we praise Hashem, but even angels and <em>Seraphim</em>, which are sublime spiritual creations,
bless, praise, glorify, sanctify, revere, and proclaim the sovereignty of His Name, Blessed Be He, and say, "<em>Kadosh</em>,<em> kadosh</em>,    <em> kadosh</em>,<em> Hashem Tzevakot</em>,<em> melo kol ha'aretz kevodo</em>" ("Holy, holy, holy, is Hashem, Master of Hosts, the whole world is filled
with His glory"), and "<em>Baruch kevod Hashem mimekomo</em>" ("Blessed is the glory of Hashem from His place"). Their praise is included in    <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yotzer HaMe'orot</em>.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Rishonim</em> disagree as to whether an individual may say <em>Kedushat HaMalachim</em> ("<em>Kadosh</em>, <em>kadosh</em>, <em>kadosh</em>...")<em> </em>in <em>Birkat Yotzer</em>. There are those who say that these verses are matters of sanctity, just like <em>Kedushah</em> in    <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, and therefore, whoever prays individually is prohibited from reciting them (<em>Ran</em>, <em>Rabbeinu Yerucham</em>). On the
    other hand, others say that this is not an ordinary<em> Kedushah</em>, but rather a description of how angels sanctify Hashem's Name, and therefore, even
    an individual can say the verses (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Rosh</em>). In order to avoid uncertainty, it is best for a person praying
    individually to recite the verses of <em>Kedushah</em> as if reading from the Torah, in the melody of cantillation signs, because according to all
    opinions, an individual is allowed to learn them, and in that way he also fulfills his obligation (<em>Terumat HaDeshen</em>,<em> Shulchan Aruch</em>
    59:3). It is not necessary to know the exact cantillation signs (<em>ta'amei hamikra</em>); rather, the main idea is that he tries to recite the words
    somewhat in cantillation to appear as if he is reading from the Prophets (<em>Nevi'im</em>).<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
Some <em>poskim</em> rule that the congregation must respond <em>Amen</em> upon hearing the <em>chazan</em> recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> (<em>Rosh</em>), whereas others maintain that <em>Amen</em> may not be answered, so as not to interrupt between the <em>berachot</em> and    <em>Keriat Shema</em> (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, based on the <em>Rambam</em>).
</p>
<p>
In practice, the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Sephardim</em> is that one who is reciting <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> does not answer <em>Amen</em> after the    <em>chazan</em>, for that is considered to be an interruption (<em>hefsek</em>). In order not to encounter uncertainty, <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is proper
    to conclude the <em>berachah </em>along with the <em>chazan</em> or slightly afterwards, and in that way, according to all opinions, it is unnecessary to
    respond <em>Amen</em>. In any case, even one who finishes before the <em>chazan</em> does not respond <em>Amen</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Ashkenazim</em> is to answer <em>Amen</em> after <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yotzer HaMe'orot</em> in <em>Shacharit</em>, and after
both <em>Birkot HaMa'ariv Aravim</em> and <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> in <em>Ma'ariv</em>. However, regarding the <em>berachah</em> immediately before<em>Keriat Shema</em>, one should try to conclude it with the <em>chazan</em> or slightly after him, so that it will not be necessary to answer<em>Amen</em> and cause an interruption between the <em>berachah</em> and <em>Keriat Shema</em>. Nevertheless, one who already finished reciting the    <em>berachah</em> and heard the <em>chazan</em> say it must answer <em>Amen</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 59:24-25; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 26:28).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. Responding to Matters of Sanctity in <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>
</h2>
<p>
    In the opinion of <em>Maharam</em> <em>of</em> <em>Rotenberg</em>, while reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em>, one may not interrupt to
    respond to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em>, for since he is already engaged in the praise of God, he is prohibited from interrupting to answer
    another matter of praise. However, according to the majority of the <em>Rishonim</em> (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Rosh</em>), for the sake of
great praises recited in a congregation, a person is permitted to interrupt even in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, and that is the halachah (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 66:3).
</p>
<p>
When interrupting, one may only respond to the most important parts of prayer. In <em>Kaddish</em> there are those who say that he may only answer, "<em>Yehei Shemei rabbah mevorach l'alam</em>..." ("May His great Name be blessed forever and ever"). Likewise, he answers <em>Amen</em> after "<em>da'amiran b'alma v'imru Amen</em>" ("that we utter in the world and say <em>Amen</em>"), which is the conclusion of the main part of the<em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:17). Others say that he may answer all five <em>Amen</em>s that one normally answers in the main part of the    <em>Kaddish</em>, which is called Half-<em>Kaddish</em>; however, the ensuing additions are not considered to be the essence of the <em>Kaddish</em>, and
    he may not interrupt to answer <em>Amen</em> after them (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 66:23; and see further in this book 23:14).
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Kedushah</em>, he may only answer by reciting the verses "<em>Kadosh</em>..." and "<em>Baruch</em>...," the essence of the response to <em>Kedushah</em>
(<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:17; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 66:2). There are those who say that he may also respond to the verse "<em>Yimloch</em>..." (    <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 66:6; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 18), and that is the widespread custom. However, he must refrain from reciting the introductory words
    that the <em>chazan</em> says before every verse.
</p>
<p>
He may respond to <em>Barchu</em>, "<em>Baruch Hashem hamevorach l'olam va'ed.</em>" ("Blessed is Hashem, Who is blessed for all eternity.") At    <em>Modim</em> of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, he bows down and answers, "<em>Modim anachnu lach</em>" ("We thank you") and nothing more.
</p>
<p>
According to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, one may answer <em>Amen</em> to the <em>berachot</em>, "<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em>" and "<em>Shomeya Tefillah</em>," which conclude the <em>berachot</em> of praise, and the <em>berachot</em> of request. According to the Sephardic    <em>minhag</em>, the law regarding those particular <em>berachot</em> is similar to other <em>berachot</em>, and one does not respond to them.
</p>
<p>
    Concerning this law, there is no difference between being in the middle of a <em>berachah</em> or paragraph, and being between <em>berachot</em> or
    paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
    All answers are permitted only in the middle of the <em>berachot</em> or after their conclusion. However, once a person says "<em>Baruch Attah Hashem</em>"
at the end of the <em>berachah</em>, and there only remain a few words to conclude the <em>berachah</em>, he may not interrupt at all (    <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 66:3). Similarly, when reciting the verses "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" and "<em>Baruch Shem kevod...</em>" in which one accepts upon
    himself the yoke of Heaven, one may not interrupt for anything, for the ruling regarding them is like that of the <em>Amidah</em>, which we do not
    interrupt at all (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 66:1).
</p>
<p>
    In any case of uncertainty, it is best not to answer, for according to many <em>poskim</em>, even if it is permissible to answer, there is no obligation to
    respond.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Interruption for a Respected Person
</h2>
<p>
    In order to prevent insult, the <em>Chachamim</em> permitted saying "<em>Shalom</em>" in the middle of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> to a
    person of exceptional distinction. Therefore, one who is in the middle of reciting <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, or one of the paragraphs of <em>Shema</em>
    , and sees a person whom he is commanded to revere, such as his father, his rabbi, or a prominent Torah leader of the generation, he may initiate a
    greeting to him. If he sees a respected person, like a <em>talmid chacham</em> (Torah scholar), a wealthy person, or a person of another status, he may not
    initiate a greeting. However, if the distinguished person says hello to him, he may respond.
</p>
<p>
    If he is in between passages, meaning between <em>berachot</em> or between paragraphs, the ruling is more lenient. In such a case, one is permitted to
    initiate an interruption in order to say "<em>Shalom</em>" to a respected person. If he is greeted, he may respond to any person (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    66:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>). In the middle of the verses "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" and "<em>Baruch Shem</em>" one must not
    interrupt, unless the situation is life-threatening.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> write that since it is accepted nowadays not to interrupt in the middle of prayer, distinguished people are not insulted when they are
    not greeted. Therefore, no permission is granted to interrupt in the middle of <em>Keriat Shema </em>and its <em>berachot</em> in order to address a
    distinguished person or a person who must be revered (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:2, based on <em>Sefer HaChinuch</em>). However, if someone who does not
    understand the value of prayer approaches the person praying, and if not answering him will likely cause insult, it is permitted to initiate a greeting to
    him. Similarly, a <em>ba'al teshuvah</em>, whose parents do not understand the value of his prayer, is permitted to say "<em>Shalom</em>" to them and
    nothing more.
</p>
<p>
    A person is allowed to interrupt by talking in the middle of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> in order to prevent himself from bodily harm
    or monetary loss, although it is preferable, if possible, to finish the paragraph or <em>berachah</em> (see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 66:1 "<em>O</em>").
    Likewise, a rabbi who receives an urgent question is allowed to reply between paragraphs and <em>berachot</em> (<em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 66:4).
</p>
<p>
    One who is reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> should stand if a <em>talmid chacham</em> passes in front of him (<em>Birkei Yosef</em>
    ,<em> Yoreh De'ah</em> 244:1). However, while accepting the yoke of Heaven in the verse "<em>Shema</em>" and "<em>Baruch Shem</em>," one may not get up.
    There is an opinion that it is preferable not to stand at all while reciting <em>Shema</em> (<em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>14:10).
</p>
<p>
One who sees his friend committing a sin should signal to him in order to stop him. However, if his friend does not take the hint, he must interrupt<em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> to tell him to stop transgressing, for if the <em>Chachamim</em> permitted the interruption of<em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> for the respect of a human being, all the more so for the respect of Heaven (<em>Ritva</em>,    <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 66:7).
</p>
<p>
    It is not appropriate to collect <em>tzedakah</em> in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, so as not to disturb the <em>kavanah</em> of the people
    praying. Nevertheless, if an honest poor person requests <em>tzedakah</em>, one is permitted to comply (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 7:4).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Adjoining Redemption to Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    Even though the recital of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em>, and the recital of the <em>Amidah</em> prayer are two separate <em>mitzvot</em>
    , one must connect them, and it is forbidden to interrupt between them. The <em>Chachamim</em> state that anyone who adjoins redemption to prayer merits
    life in the World to Come (<em>Berachot</em> 4b). If he adjoins them while praying <em>vatikin</em>, he is promised that he will not be harmed that whole
    day (<em>Berachot</em> 9b, and <em>Tosafot</em> there). One who interrupts between redemption and prayer is considered similar to a king's beloved, who
    comes and knocks on the king's door. When the king emerges to find out what his beloved desires, he has already left to take care of another matter. The
mention of Israel's redemption from Egypt is akin to the knock on the king's door, because the redemption demonstrates the great love    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> has for Israel. Therefore, the Exodus from Egypt is considered as the engagement between <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> and
    Israel. Distractions are forbidden. Out of the special closeness expressed in the redemption, we must maintain the state of devotion sparked by prayer and
    request that Hashem bless and redeem us, just as He redeemed us from Egypt (see <em>Yerushalmi Berachot </em>chapter 1, halachah 1).
</p>
<p>
    Even if a person hears <em>Kaddish</em> or <em>Kedushah</em> between redemption and prayer, he may not answer (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>66:9). One may not
    interrupt at all, even silently, between redemption and prayer.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    Many <em>chazanim</em> are accustomed to concluding <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> quietly so that people will not answer <em>Amen</em>. The reason
for this is that some say that one who finished <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em>, but did not yet start the <em>Amidah</em>, and heard the<em>chazan</em>'s conclusion of <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> must answer <em>Amen</em>. They maintain that it is not considered to be an interruption (    <em>hefsek</em>), since answering <em>Amen</em> to <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> is a continuation of one's involvement in redemption (<em>Rama</em>). However,
others maintain that even answering <em>Amen</em> to <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> constitutes an interruption between redemption and prayer (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>). Therefore, in order to spare the congregation from uncertainty, some <em>chazanim</em> conclude the <em>berachah</em> silently,
    so that no one can answer <em>Amen</em>. Others are less concerned and conclude <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> in a regular voice. At a time when
there were people in the congregation who fulfilled their obligation by hearing the <em>chazan</em>, the <em>chazan</em> was required to recite the whole    <em>berachah</em> out loud.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    One who arrives late, when the congregation is about to begin the <em>Amidah</em>, must recite the prayers in the correct order and adjoin redemption to
    prayer. Despite the fact that he will miss praying with the congregation, it is preferable that he prays in the proper order, since the adjoining of
    redemption to prayer is preferable to prayer in a <em>minyan</em>. However, concerning <em>Ma'ariv</em>, the law is different (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    236:3; and see further in this book 25:4).
</p>
<p>
According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, on Shabbat it is less necessary to adjoin redemption to prayer. Therefore if one hears <em>Kaddish</em> or    <em>Kedushah</em> between redemption and prayer, he should respond to it.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>

            [1] The first <em>berachah</em>, "<em>Yotzer HaMe'orot</em>," opens with the word "<em>Baruch</em>" and the <em>berachot</em> that follow, although
they are long, do not begin with "<em>Baruch</em>" since they are considered to be a continuation of the first <em>berachah</em>. The fact that            <em>l'chatchilah</em> they must be recited together with <em>Keriat Shema</em> is agreed upon by all opinions. According to the <em>Gra</em> and
those of similar opinion, this matter is simple. It seems that even the reasoning behind the ruling of the <em>Ra'ah</em> and the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, who write that one should fulfill his obligation of <em>Keriat Shema</em> by having <em>kavanah</em> when reciting            <em>Keriat Shema</em> of the <em>Korbanot</em>, is that by the time the congregation prays, it is too late, and there is concern that the time to
recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> will pass. However, were there no such case, all opinions agree that it is best to fulfill the obligation of            <em>Keriat Shema</em> with its <em>berachot</em>.

Likewise, this can be learned from the law that a person who is uncertain as to whether or not he recited <em>Keriat Shema </em>and its            <em>berachot</em> must also repeat the <em>berachot</em>. At first glance this is problematic, for when there is doubt concerning <em>berachot</em>
            we are lenient and we refrain from reciting them (<em>safek berachot l'hakel</em>). However, since the <em>berachot</em> are part of the
fulfillment of the mitzvah of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, the law regarding the <em>berachot</em> follows <em>Keriat Shema</em>, see            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 67:4, based on the <em>Rashba</em>. This can also be inferred from the law regarding a person whose profession is Torah
learning, for although he is exempt from prayer, he is obligated to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> (            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 106:6).

            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
54:14. He adds that a person who is after <em>Barchu</em> is considered like one who is in the middle of a passage. If <em>tallit</em> and            <em>tefillin</em> are brought to him, he must postpone putting them on until the end of the <em>berachah</em>, as clarified in note 4 of this
            chapter.

See <em>Beit Yosef</em> 69 who writes that some say that concerning <em>Perisat Shema</em> the <em>chazan</em> must recite <em>Birkat</em>            <em>Yotzer Or</em> in addition to <em>Barchu</em>, even if he already said it, because one may not recite <em>Barchu</em> without saying at least
            one <em>berachah</em> after it. So writes the <em>Mahari</em> <em>Abuhav</em>, whose words are clarified in the<em> Mishnah Berurah</em> 69:3.
            However, <em>Darkei Moshe</em> writes that one may say <em>Barchu</em> without reciting a subsequent <em>berachah</em>. That is the customary
practice at the end of the prayer service; <em>Barchu</em> is recited without a <em>berachah</em>. Nevertheless, as we learned, the essence of            <em>Barchu</em> is to introduce <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 59:10 writes based on the <em>Pri Chadash</em> that if he is praying individually and a congregation in the vicinity
            is praying at a different place in the prayer service, the individual may say <em>Kedushat Yotzer</em> in the regular manner. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            21 writes based on <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> that even in such a case it should be read with cantillation signs.

The <em>Torat Chaim</em> (<em>Sofer</em>) 66:8 writes that it is not an obligation to respond, rather one is permitted to do so, as written in            <em>Shut Yad Eliyahu </em>and the <em>Maharshag</em>. See <em>Yabia Omer</em> part 1, 5:7 and part 8, 6:1-2. <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 6:12 writes
that even in <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> one is permitted to answer but is not obligated to do so. Additionally, we already learned that according to            <em>Maharam of Rotenberg</em>, it is forbidden to answer either <em>Kaddish</em> or <em>Kedushah</em> in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>
            , and although the halachah does not follow his opinion, nevertheless, in a situation of uncertainty, one may take his opinion into account and not
respond. Concerning the question of whether or not it is preferable for a person to respond, the answer depends. If he is praying in a            <em>minyan</em>, and he will hear all the matters of sanctity anyway, then if responding will disturb his concentration, it is best that he does
            not answer. However, if the people are standing for <em>Kedushah</em>, he must be sure not to appear as though he is separating himself from the
            congregation, and therefore he must stand with his legs together when they do, and likewise bow at <em>Modim</em>. If another opportunity will not
arise to hear <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em>, it is best that he answers with them (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:51). See the laws of            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in this book, chapter 14:4, and note 7.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:23 mentions different opinions regarding whether one is allowed to respond <em>Amen</em> to <em>berachot</em> while
            in between the passages. Although he tends to agree that one may respond, I have not mentioned this, based on the rule that in a case of
            uncertainty, "<em>shev v'al ta'aseh adif</em>," sitting and not performing an action is preferable. The <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>,
part 4, 21:2 rules that one responds <em>Amen</em> to the <em>Kohanim</em> who are reciting the verses of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, since the            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 128 states that this <em>Amen</em> is a biblical obligation. One who must relieve himself must do so and wash his hands,
            although he recites <em>Asher Yatzar</em> only after he finishes the <em>Amidah </em>(<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:23). If he is called up to the
            Torah, according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 66:4 he does not ascend, although according to the Ashkenazic<em> poskim</em> he does. Even
according to the Ashkenazic<em> </em>custom, if he suspects that he will be called up, it is best that he leave the synagogue beforehand (            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:26). If he is in the middle of reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, the law is more lenient, and if he is called he
            ascends. If he is the only <em>Kohen</em> or <em>Levi</em> present, he can be called <em>l'chatchilah</em>, as explained in chapter 14:5 of this
            book.

If a person did not have <strong><em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em></strong>, and they are brought to him after he already began reciting<em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, but before he reaches <em>Shema</em>, he must wait until the conclusion of the <em>berachah</em>. According to the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, he wraps himself in the <em>tallit</em> and puts on the <em>tefillin</em> with a <em>berachah</em>. According to the<em>Rama</em>, he recites the <em>berachot</em> on the <em>tefillin</em>, but wraps himself in his <em>tallit</em> without reciting the<em>berachah</em>, since there is no obligation to wrap himself in a <em>tallit</em> for <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>. If the <em>tallit</em> and            <em>tefillin</em> were brought to him after he already reached <em>Keriat Shema</em>, there is discussion among the <em>poskim</em> about how to
put on <em>tefillin</em> in the middle of a passage so that he will not appear as someone who is giving false testimony even regarding one verse of            <em>Keriat Shema</em>. Still, it seems that he can decide in his heart to repeat that same passage from the beginning and then he will be
            considered as one who is between passages, allowing him to recite the blessing on the <em>tefillin</em> according to all opinions. As an added
precaution, he can continue reading until the end of the passage like one who reads the Torah, then put on <em>tefillin</em> with a            <em>berachah</em>, and then go back to read with <em>kavanah</em> from the beginning of that same passage. By doing so, he evades the dispute
            between the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and the <em>Rama</em> and he will not lose out on saying the second <em>berachah</em> that is recited according
to <em>Minhag Ashkenazim</em>, which he would miss if he were to put on the <em>tefillin</em> in the middle of the passage (see<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:47). If his <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> are brought to him in the middle of the<em>Emet V'Yatziv berachah</em>, according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, he wraps himself in the <em>tallit</em> and he puts on his<em>tefillin</em> without a <em>berachah</em>. According to the <em>Rama</em>, he recites the blessings on his <em>tefillin</em>. The<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:47 writes that it is correct to recite only the "<em>Lehaniach</em>" <em>berachah</em>. If the <em>tallit</em> and<em>tefillin</em> were brought to him between <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, he puts on <em>tefillin</em> without a            <em>berachah</em> and does not wrap himself in his <em>tallit</em>, so as not to interrupt between redemption and prayer (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
            66:8).

If he hears <em>Kaddish</em> or <em>Kedushah</em> while he is between the <em>berachah</em> of redemption and the <em>Amidah</em>, according to the            <em>Tehillah L'David</em> 111:1, he remains silent and listens like one who hears it in the middle of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, and his listening
            will be considered like a response. So writes the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 111:2. <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em> 66:13 rules that it is forbidden to
            interrupt even silently and that the law regarding interruption between redemption and prayer is more stringent than an interruption in the middle
            of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, and so writes the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 66:39. It seems that since according to the majority of <em>poskim</em> there is
            no obligation to respond when one is engaged in the recital of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, and all the more so in the <em>Amidah</em>, therefore
            it is best that he start <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> without waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
            If he must hear the <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em> because he will not have another opportunity to respond to them, he should practice
according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 66:9; waiting at the words "<em>Shirah chadashah</em>" and answering. Regarding one who was brought            <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> in the middle of <em>Birkat Ga'al Yisrael</em>, see end of note 4 in this chapter.

The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 111:1, based on the <em>Zohar</em>, rules that an <em>Amen</em> recited after the <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em><em>berachah</em> is considered to be an interruption, although according to the <em>Tur</em> and the <em>Rama</em> it is not. Nevertheless, the<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:35 writes that it is good to refrain from putting oneself in a position of uncertainty by concluding the            <em>berachah</em> of <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> together with the <em>chazan</em>. It is best that one who finishes before him already starts saying
the words, "<em>Hashem sefatai tiftach</em>...." In that way, even according to the <em>Rama</em> he will not need to say <em>Amen</em>. The            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> (who lived in Ashkenaz) 111:2 writes that in any case, even if he did not start the <em>Amidah</em>, the custom is not to
            answer <em>Amen</em>. Concerning the <em>minhag</em> to finish <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> quietly, see <em>Beit Baruch</em> 20:56 who expresses doubt
            concerning this. However, there are others who praise the custom; see <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 17 note 83.

            According to <em>Hagahot Ashiri</em> and the <em>Maharil</em>, on Shabbat there is less of a need to adjoin redemption to prayer since, according
            to the extrapolation from the verse, the obligation to adjoin them is only on a day of distress. But on Shabbat, which is not deemed a day of
            distress, it is unnecessary to do so. The <em>Beit Yosef</em> writes that their words seem reasonable. However, the <em>Rama</em> 111:1 writes that
            it is best <em>l'chatchilah</em> to be stringent and adjoin them also on Shabbat, although in times of need it is unnecessary. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
111:9 writes that the law regarding Shabbat is like that of weekdays. However, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 9, <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> there, and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 111:5 write that if a person hears <em>Kaddish</em> or <em>Kedushah</em> between redemption and prayer on Shabbat, he should
            respond. However, if he arrives late, he does not pray with the congregation, saying <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> afterwards, as
            is customary to do in <em>Ma'ariv.</em> Rather he prays in the correct order so that he can adjoin redemption to prayer.<em></em>
