Chapter One: The Meaning of the Holiday
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Festival of <em>Matzot</em> and the Festival of Pesah<em></em>
</h2>
<p>
    The holiday of Pesah has two different names in the Torah: <em>Hag Ha-matzot </em>(the Festival of <em>Matzot</em>)
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    and <em>Hag Ha-Pesah </em>(the Paschal festival, or Passover).
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
These two names express two different meanings of the holiday: <em>Hag Ha-matzot </em>represents the revelation of God's providence, and    <em>Hag Ha-Pesah</em> represents Israel's unique spiritual capacity.
</p>
<p>
    At the Exodus from Egypt, God's sovereignty over the world was given its most apparent and concrete manifestation. Thus, our faith in God is fundamentally
    rooted in the Exodus. The matza symbolizes this aspect of our holiday, as we read in the Hagada: "This matza that we eat - what is the reason? Because our
    forefathers' dough did not have time to rise before the holy Supreme King of kings <strong>revealed</strong> Himself to them and redeemed them."
</p>
<p>
    The unique mission and destiny of the people of Israel was also revealed at the time of the Exodus. The distinction between the Egyptians and the
    Israelites was conspicuous in all of the plagues, as the Egyptians were struck and the Israelites were saved. This culminated with the Plague of the
    Firstborn, when the Destroyer struck every Egyptian household but passed over (<em>pasah</em>) Israelite homes. Israel's uniqueness is expressed through
    and symbolized by the Paschal sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
    These two fundamental principles - faith and Israel - are linked together and interdependent. Unlike the other nations, which are formed through human
    endeavor, the nation of Israel was forged through divine miracles and wonders at the time of the Exodus for the purpose of receiving God's Torah. Israel's
    status entirely depends on their connection with God: when Israel does God's will and makes God's name manifest in the world, they earn all the blessings
    promised in the Torah. But when they do not fulfill God's will, all of the curses written in the Torah are visited upon them.
</p>
<p>
    The revelation of God's name in the world, i.e., the manifestation of divine values on earth, depends upon Israel, as Scripture states: "I created this
    nation for My sake; they will tell My praise" (Yeshayahu 43:21). For this reason, the Sages stated (<em>Bereishit Rabba</em> 1:4) that the idea of Israel
    preceded the creation of the world, for it is through Israel that the purpose of the world is revealed. This is what the Sages meant when they said: "God
set a condition with Creation: 'If Israel accepts the Torah, you will continue to exist, but if not, then I will return you to being formless and void'" (    <em>Shabbat</em> 88a). Israel's unique capabilities were further made manifest in that God chose us to be His nation and children, in spite of the fact
    that we were lowly slaves, stuck in the morass of impurity in Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Thus the two biblical names of the holiday express two aspects of one matter, namely, the revelation of God's name in the world through Israel.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
2. The Festival of Freedom - the Revelation of Morality
</h2>
<p>
    Why did the people of Israel, before their appearance as a nation, first have to endure such terrible slavery in Egypt? The simple explanation is that
    Israel's mission is to rectify the moral state of the world, and in order to do so, it must experience firsthand the suffering and the pain that human
    beings can cause to one another.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, we find several instances where the Torah invokes our experiences in Egypt when instructing us about interpersonal relationships. For example: "You
    shall not oppress a stranger - for you know the soul of a stranger, since you were strangers in the land of Egypt" (Shemot 23:9) and "If a stranger resides
    with you in your land, you shall not wrong him. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as
    yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God" (Vayikra 19:33-34).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the Sages said that before God began to smite the Egyptians, He instructed Moshe to command Israel concerning the mitzva of releasing slaves.
    Thus, even before they gained their freedom from Egypt they resolved that once they become free and have slaves of their own, they would never torment
    them. On the contrary, after six years they would send slaves free and grant them generous gifts (<em>y. </em>RH<em> </em>3:5).
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, an amazing thing happened at the Exodus. All other peoples who had overthrown their enslavers became haughty and enslaved their former masters.
    Israel, however, did not try to enslave the Egyptians, even after they had been completely defeated; they only sought their own freedom. This was the first
    time that freedom appeared in the world as a moral value.
</p>
<p>
    This is why Pesah is called the Festival of Freedom, or, as the Sages termed it in the liturgy, "<em>zman herutenu</em>," "the season of our freedom." It
    is no coincidence that Pesah is the first of the pilgrimage festivals: it embodies the foundation of human freedom and consequently of moral responsibility
    for every individual and societal act. Perhaps this is also why the years of Israelite kings' reigns were counted from the beginning the month of Nisan, so
    that the idea of freedom be fundamental to Israelite sovereignty.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. Spiritual Liberation from Material Enslavement
</h2>
<p>
    Israel and Egypt are diametrically opposed. Egypt was an extremely materialistic society with a pagan worldview. The nation of Israel, on the other hand,
    is unique with its spiritual and abstract worldview. Thus, only Israel was able to accept the abstract belief in one incorporeal and non-physical God.
    Consequently, Israel's relationship to the material world is also pure and refined, and Jews are thus naturally modest and circumscribed in their sexual
    mores. The Egyptians, on the other hand, due to their emphasis on the physical and their materialistic worldview, were strongly attracted to promiscuity
    and sexual transgression. Thus, the Torah commands: "You shall not do like the deeds of the land of Egypt, in which you dwelt" (Vayikra 18:3). The Sages
    interpreted this to mean that no nation committed deeds more abominable than the Egyptians did (<em>Torat Kohanim ad loc.</em>), especially the last
    generation that enslaved Israel (based on Maharal's <em>Gevurot</em> <em>Hashem</em> ch. 4).
</p>
<p>
    The Egyptians of that period indeed accomplished some amazing material and administrative feats by creating a stable regime, an advanced irrigation system,
    and a sophisticated economy (in part due to the help of Yosef, Yaakov's son). However, these material accomplishments were disconnected from the spiritual
    world and even opposed to it. Their worldview was extremely idolatrous. They did not believe in the existence of an independent, spiritual soul, but
    thought that the soul is contingent on and subservient to the existence of the physical body. This is why the Egyptians went to such great lengths to
    embalm corpses; they thought that one's existence hinges solely on his physical reality. Death, in their view, merely means that one is no longer able to
    move or speak, but is no different from life in every other respect. Accordingly, they also invested enormous effort in building the pyramids, which are
    glorified cemeteries for the body.
</p>
<p>
    To be sure, the material world has an important place in Judaism as well. However, a worldview based solely on physical existence will necessarily be
    idolatrous and amoral. This is because all of the paradigms provided by nature are amoral. There may be beauty and wisdom reflected in the amazing
    regularity of the laws of nature, but they do not possess morality. The strong prey on the weak just as the powerful enslave the poor. The pagan worldview,
    instead of striving toward a higher level, sanctifies material existence with all its brutality and injustice. In contrast, a faith-based and spiritual
    worldview is characterized by constant striving toward improving the world, fighting evil and empowering justice. This is how the prophet Yeshayahu
    described the ultimate redemption and the <em>Mashi'ah</em>'s leadership:
</p>
<p>
    But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the land; he shall smite the land with the rod of his mouth, and
    with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked. Righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist, and faithfulness the girdle of his loins. The wolf
    shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid... the cow and the bear shall graze, together their young shall lie down. The lion
    shall eat straw like cattle... They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the
    waters cover the sea. (Yeshayahu 11:4-9)
</p>
<p>
    Thus, the Exodus from Egypt was not merely the emancipation of the Israelites enslaved in Egypt. Rather, it was the liberation of all mankind from the
    chains of materialism. This is why it is so important to delve into the Exodus, to the extent that we are commanded to see ourselves, every year on the
    Seder night, as though we ourselves left Egypt. We have also been commanded to remember the Exodus every day and every night. To a certain extent, Shabbat
    and all holidays were established to commemorate the Exodus, for at the Exodus the spirit of man was freed from the bonds of material existence. Since we
    have not finished liberating ourselves from the bonds of the material world - the chains of the evil impulse and its lusts - from a spiritual perspective,
    we still need to continue leaving Egypt. Hence, it is a mitzva to delve into the Exodus.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. At the Exodus, the Material World Became a Vehicle for God's <em>Shekhina</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The way this world is ordered, its material aspects gain prominence first and easily reach their complete, powerful expression. Spiritual elements,
    however, remain hidden; it takes a long time before their significance becomes discernible. It was thus natural that the Egyptians initially overpowered
    Israel, for Egyptian might had already come to full fruition, while Israel was still like an unborn embryo. Since Israel's strength could not be yet
    expressed, the Egyptians exploited Israel's weakness and enslaved them to fuel their glory and their lusts.
</p>
<p>
    But this was also for the best. Spirituality cannot be expressed in the world without a material basis, and this is exactly what we gained from being
    enslaved in Egypt. During the entire period that the Egyptians enslaved Israel and thought that they were overpowering us completely, in reality we were
    drawing and absorbing their power, as it is written: "The Israelites were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty;
    and the land was filled with them" (Shemot 1:7). The more the Egyptians tried to enslave and subdue us, the more we increased, as it is written: "But the
    more they tormented them, the more they multiplied, and the more they proliferated" (<em>Ibid</em>. 12) until we numbered 600,000 adult men. Maharal
    explains (<em>Gevurot Hashem</em> chs. 4 and 12) that this was the number necessary for the establishment of the nation of Israel. Once we numbered
    600,000, an aspect of the divine was revealed within us, the Egyptian empire collapsed, and we left Egypt to receive the Torah at Sinai.
</p>
<p>
    Not only were we blessed with fertility in Egypt, we also left Egypt with great wealth, compensation for many years of slavery. Thus, Israel began its
    course with a solid material foundation. This is the meaning of:
</p>
<p>
    When you go, you shall not go empty-handed; rather, every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of she who lives in her house silver and gold vessels and
    clothes; and you shall put them upon your sons and your daughters, and thus you shall despoil Egypt<a name="22"></a>. (Shemot 3:21-22)
</p>
<p>
    The Egyptians got their just desserts; had they chosen to be righteous, they would have taken care of the Israelites and helped them multiply and prosper.
    They would have benefited from this doubly, as they did when Yosef contributed to Egypt's success during the difficult years of famine. But they chose
    evil, cruelly enslaving Israel, and consequently they were punished with ten plagues. The name of God was thus sanctified in the world, for the wicked were
    brought to justice and Israel left to eternal freedom.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. The Meaning of the Prohibition against <em>Hametz</em> - Pride in Relation to God
</h2>
<p>
    The prohibition against <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is especially stringent, for the Torah not only forbade eating it, but commanded that it not be seen nor
found in our possession. Our Sages further forbade eating any food with even the slightest amount of <em>hametz </em>mixed in. Thus the avoidance of    <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is absolute. This is because <em>hametz</em> symbolizes evil, as it says in the <em>Zohar</em> (2:40b) that <em>hametz</em> is the
    evil impulse. Specifically, it alludes to the impulse of pride. Fermentation causes dough to rise - it looks as though the dough is inflating itself and
    puffing up with pride, as an arrogant person would. In contrast, matza, which remains in its original size, as it was when God created it, symbolizes the
    trait of humility.
</p>
<p>
    At first glance, this is difficult to understand. If <em>hametz</em> represents the evil inclination, then why is there no commandment or custom to avoid
    it throughout the year? On the contrary, man is praised for knowing how to make wheat into tasty <em>hametz</em> cakes (see <em>Tanhuma Tazri'a</em> 5).
    This was the Creator's purpose in endowing man with the wisdom and practical skills to engage in developing the world. God created an imperfect world
    intentionally, so that man could imitate His deeds and participate in improving the world through scientific and technological development.
</p>
<p>
    The answer is that there are two types of pride: One is that man exaggerates his own praiseworthiness and thinks he is wiser, stronger, and better than he
    really is. Any intelligent person understands that such pride harms one's ability to actualize his potential for the betterment of the world. His ability
    to judge is completely impaired, and he cannot conduct his life properly. Clearly, such pride is inappropriate all year long and has nothing to do with the
    prohibition of <em>hametz</em>. On the contrary, such pride detracts from one's good works and thus harms the good, year-round <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The second type of pride, which corresponds to <em>hametz</em> on Pesah, is man's pride vis-a-vis his Creator, his God. Jewish faith is predicated on the
    acknowledgment that God created the world and determined its destiny, and that the roots of all things depend on Him alone. Although God gave man the
    ability to improve and to develop the world, this is limited to manipulating and developing the outgrowths of the root elements of creation; man has no
    power over the root elements, which are divine creations. God created the world, chose the people of Israel to be His <em>am segula</em>, His treasured
    nation, and gave them the Torah. Man has no authority to call these fundamental principles into question. Therefore, when one stands before his Creator, he
must envelop himself in humility and make every effort not mix his petty human thoughts with the fundamental principles of creation. Such confusion, like    <em>hametz </em>on Pesah, is forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    Pesah, and especially the Seder, is designed to instill in us the fundamentals of faith: that the world has a Creator, that He watches over His creatures,
    and that He chose the people of Israel to reveal His name in the world. Whenever there is revelation of an aspect of the divine in the world, it appears in
    a completely miraculous fashion, to show that it is not a human endeavor. Thus, the Exodus was accompanied by signs and wonders, to make public that the
    election of Israel was a divine matter. Similarly, the Torah was given with obvious miracles, to a generation that lived miraculously for forty years in
    the desert, in order to make it known that this was an entirely divine matter. In other words, we <strong>receive</strong> the fundamental principles of
faith from God - we do not invent them. Whoever mixes some human aspect into these basic principles of faith is guilty of idolatry. This is alluded to in    <em>Zohar</em>'s statement that <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is idolatry (2:182a).
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, on Pesah, the holiday geared toward imparting the fundamentals of faith, we are commanded to be extremely cautious to avoid eating and
    possessing even a smidgen of <em>hametz</em>, which symbolizes our human aspects that must not get mixed in when we speak about the roots and foundations
    of faith. During the rest of the year, however, when we are involved with developing and improving the branches, <em>hametz</em> is allowed and even
    desirable.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. The Meaning of Matza
</h2>
<p>
    Matza, symbolizing our recognition that the spiritual roots of things are beyond our grasp even though God granted us the ability to operate within and
    improve the world, is the opposite of <em>hametz</em>. Therefore, on Pesah, when we are engaged with the most fundamental elements of faith, we do not mix
    even one iota of <em>hametz</em> in our food. We eat only matza, which remains simple and thin throughout its baking, without going through any additional
    process of swelling.
</p>
<p>
    Through our humility before God, expressed in the matza, we internalize the faith, first revealed at the Exodus from Egypt, that God actively watches over
    the world and elected Israel. To be sure, there were elite individuals who believed in God even before the Exodus, but their connection with the divine was
    of a personal nature. The wholeness of faith was first revealed only at the Exodus, with the formation of a complete nation containing all strata of
    society destined to manifest God's name in the world.
</p>
<p>
    Matza comes to remind us of faith and is therefore called the "food of faith" (<em>meikhla de-mehemnuta</em>) by the <em>Zohar</em> (2:183b). By eating
    matza on the Seder night with the proper intent, one achieves faith, and by eating matza all seven days of Pesah, one implants that faith firmly in one's
    heart (<em>Pri Tzadik</em>,<em> </em>Pesah 9).
</p>
<p>
    Since matza signifies faith, it is understandable that its entire manufacturing process must be performed very meticulously, as we will learn below (ch.
    12, p. 200 ff.). This is because the roots of all things depend on faith, and any small flaw in faith can cause tremendous destruction in the world.
</p>
<p>
    We can thus understand why the nation of Israel came into being as slaves in Egypt. All other nations develop naturally, from the ground up, from family to
    clan to tribe to nation. As they grow, they develop cultures that evolve out of the circumstances of their lives, the climate of their territories, and
    their conflicts with their neighbors. As part of the emergence of their culture, they develop some type of deistic belief. Since human beings are involved
    in their invention, such beliefs are idolatrous.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, Israel became a nation as slaves, devoid of any culture. They could not develop their own culture while enslaved and lacking national
    self-esteem. At the same time, Egyptian culture was foreign to them and possibly despised by them, as it was associated with their tormentors. Israel was
    thus a <em>tabula rasa</em>, free of preconceived notions, and perfectly capable of absorbing the true faith based on divine revelation and accepting the
    Torah without introducing human considerations into its fundamental principles. The impoverished, unembellished matza alludes to the condition of the
    Israelites at that time.
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. One Who Demeans the Holy Days
</h2>
<p>
    An important principle is articulated in <em>Mishna Avot</em> (3:11): "Rabbi Elazar Ha-Moda'i says: 'One who desecrates holy foods, one who demeans the
    holy days ... and one who expounds the Torah not in accordance with <em>halakha</em>, even if he has Torah study and good deeds to his credit, has no share
    in the World to Come.'"
</p>
<p>
R. Zvi Yehuda Kook would ask how one with Torah study and good deeds to his credit could not have a share in the World to Come. Moreover, since the    <em>mishna</em> does not specify how much Torah study and good deeds this person has to his credit, it is implied that even if the person is a great Torah
    scholar, highly scrupulous in his observance of <em>mitzvot</em>, and a doer of many good deeds, he has no share in the World to Come since he demeans the
    holy days and expounds the Torah not in accordance with the <em>halakha</em>.
</p>
<p>
    R. Zvi Yehuda went on to describe one who greatly respects tradition and is meticulous about fulfilling the halakhic requirements of the Seder, but
    considers it all the product of human intelligence. He explains that the importance of the Pesah holiday and the Seder lies in the parents passing their
    traditions on to the next generations, imparting to them the moral principles of human liberty and a sense of mission to improve the world. The matza
    merely concretizes Israel's historical consciousness, and the four cups of wine simply add a dimension of joy. Even though all of these lovely ideas are
    true, the central fundamental principle is missing: that God chose us from among all nations, gave us the Torah, and commanded us to celebrate Pesah and
    eat matza on the Seder night.
</p>
<p>
    R. Zvi Yehuda's hypothetical Jew similarly honors Shabbat as a day when the family spends time together and grows closer, and when hardworking people can
    rest and engage in spiritual pursuits. He even adds that "Shabbat kept the Jews more than the Jews kept Shabbat." He forgets only one thing: that God
    commanded us to observe Shabbat, down to its finest detail.
</p>
<p>
    This is what the <em>mishna</em> meant by "one who expounds the Torah not in accordance with <em>halakha</em>." Even though he studies it diligently, to
    him it is not God's Torah but merely human wisdom, so he allows himself to interpret it any way that comes to mind. Thus he demeans the holy days; he
    thinks they are customs and traditions that human beings invented to give expression to all sorts of spiritual notions, thereby denying that they are
    God-given <em>mitzvot</em> of the Torah. Therefore, even though he may have studied much Torah and performed many good deeds, and he is thought of as a
    good, honorable man in this world - he has no connection with holiness. He has no share in the eternal historical mission of the Jewish people, and thus
    has no share in the World to Come.
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. One Inquires about the Laws of Pesah Beginning Thirty Days before Pesah
</h2>
<p>
    We inquire about and expound upon the laws of Pesah beginning thirty days before Pesah. We learn this from Moshe, who on Pesah itself explained the matter
    of <em>Pesah Sheni</em>, the make-up date for those unable to bring the Paschal offering, which takes place thirty days later. The main reason for this is
that all of Israel had to prepare animal sacrifices as Pesah approached, examining them to be certain that they were free of disqualifying blemishes (    <em>Pesahim</em> 6a; AZ 5b).
</p>
<p>
    This enactment was not canceled even after the Temple was destroyed; one must study the laws of Pesah thirty days before the holiday arrives. As is well
    known, Pesah has very many laws, pertaining to preparing the home for Pesah, seeking and destroying <em>hametz</em>, baking the matza, and the Seder. Some
    Rishonim maintained that the enactment applies specifically to Torah scholars, enjoining them to prioritize answering practical questions about the
    upcoming holiday. According to this view, there is no universal obligation to set a fixed time for studying the laws of Pesah (Ran and<em> </em>Rashba).
    Nevertheless, since many Rishonim maintain that it is indeed obligatory to set a fixed time for studying the laws of Pesah beginning thirty days before
    Pesah, it is proper that every individual do so, beginning on the fourteenth of Adar (Purim). It is also proper for schools and <em>yeshivot </em>to set a
    fixed time for studying the laws of Pesah during this period.
</p>
<p>
    There is a dispute amongst halakhic authorities on whether one is obliged to study the laws of the other holidays thirty days in advance. Some say that
    since this enactment was established primarily for preparing the animal sacrifices, and such sacrifices were in fact brought on the three pilgrimage
    festivals - the <em>olat re'iya </em>(pilgrimage burnt-offering), <em>shalmei hagiga </em>(pilgrimage peace offerings), and <em>shalmei simha </em>
    (festival peace offerings) - therefore it is proper to study the laws of each festival thirty days in advance. Others say that the practice today primarily
    concerns Pesah, since its laws are so numerous and strict (MB 429:1).
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    These differences of opinion and distinctions concern advance preparations for the holidays. During the course of the holidays, however, there is an
    ancient enactment, ordained by Moshe, for people to study the laws and spiritual meanings of that holiday (<em>Megilla</em> 32a, MA 429:1).

            . <em>Tosafot</em> AZ 5b, s.v. "ve-hatnan" states that even after the destruction of the Temple this decree was not nullified. MB 429:1 (see also
            BHL <em>ad loc.</em>) reinforces the opinion that one must learn the laws of Pesah thirty days before, and rejects Ran's opinion since most
            Rishonim disagree with him. This is also the opinion of many Aharonim, including SAH 429:1-3, which explains the issue thoroughly and states that
            this is a rabbinic decree (as opposed to the opinion of <em>Bah</em>, which states that it is a Torah law). Conversely, see <em>Yabi'a Omer</em>
            2:222, which explains that Ran and Rashba maintain that the essence of the decree is to first answer a person who asks about the laws of Pesah,
since he is asking about a pertinent issue, and that this is the opinion of most Rishonim. (There is also debate about the position of            <em>Shulhan Arukh</em> itself: some infer that it concurs with Ran from the fact that it only mentions the term "ask"; others reject this
            inference.) In practice, I used the terms "mitzva" and "proper" since not everyone agrees that this is an obligation. Moreover, even though
            according to <em>Bah</em> this is in fact a Torah obligation, most authorities view it only as a rabbinic decree.

            It is also worth noting that there are authorities who maintain that the main obligation is for rabbis and Torah teachers to begin teaching the
            laws of Pesah thirty days before the festival, but there is no obligation on each individual. This is what <em>Hok Yaakov</em> states in 429:1, 3,
            adding in the name of <em>Rokei'ah</em>, Raavan, and <em>Kol Bo,</em> that even the reading of <em>Parshat Para</em> right after Purim was
            established to remind the people to purify themselves for the upcoming Pesah. Similarly, many Aharonim write that this is the reason for the
            establishment of the custom to teach the laws of Pesah on <em>Shabbat</em><em> Ha-Gadol</em>, as recorded in SAH and MB 429:2. Nevertheless,
            according to most authorities there is still a mitzva<em> </em>for every individual to delve into the laws of Pesah during the thirty days prior to
            the festival. BHL rules accordingly. However, there is arguably a greater obligation for rabbis and teachers.
