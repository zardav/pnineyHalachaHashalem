    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages instituted that men pray with a <em>minyan</em> and in a
synagogue, but they did not institute that women pray with a<em>minyan</em>. Clearly there is value in praying with a        <em>minyan</em> in a synagogue for women as well, because the divine
        Presence dwells within the <em>minyan</em> and the synagogue is a place
dedicated for prayer. Additionally, if a woman prays with a<em>minyan</em> she has the opportunity to answer "amen"        <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>, to participate in the
recitation of <em>Kedusha</em> and <em>Modim</em>, and to hear        <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. Nevertheless<em>, </em>the Sages did not
        institute prayer with a <em>minyan</em> for women, in order to prevent
        conflict between the obligations prayer with a <em>minyan</em> in a
        synagogue and care for her family, for devotion to the family is more
        important (above, 3:2). As we learned, women are obligated to pray
        because they too must ask for mercy.
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
        However, the institution of prayer with a <em>minyan</em> is not linked
        to the actual request for mercy; rather, it is an separate matter
        mitzva that demands more time. Women are thus exempt (see above, 3:8-9,
        regarding the conceptual difference between men’s and women’s prayer).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        On Shabbat and festivals, when there is more free time, many women
        habitually pray in the synagogue. Likewise, there are women, mainly
        older women no longer burdened by family demands, who enhance the
        mitzva by praying every day in the synagogue. Below (20:1-2; 22:7) we
        will expand on the virtue of prayer with a <em>minyan</em> in a
        synagogue.

        <a name="_Toc402175227">2. Establishing a Regular Place to Pray</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is a mitzva to designate a permanent place for prayer. This is what
        the patriarch Avraham did, as it is written: "Avraham woke up early in
the morning [to go] to the place where he had stood (<em>amad</em>)        <em> </em>before God" (Bereishit 19:27), implying that he had a regular
        place where he would stand before God. The primary importance of
establishing a place to pray pertains to the recitation of the<em>Amida</em> (lit. "standing") prayer (<em>Ben </em><em>Ish Ĥai</em>,        <em>Miketz</em> 4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The designation of a place of prayer expresses the complete connection
        that we have with God. Everything else in the world can change, but
        one’s connection to God is the most permanent and stable reality and
        should therefore transpire at a fixed place. The Sages say: "Whoever
        sets a place to pray is helped by the God of Avraham, and his enemies
fall to him" (<em>Berakhot</em> 6b, 7b; see Maharal,        <em>Netiv Ha-avoda</em>, ch. 4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Men fulfill this mitzva by establishing a set place to pray in the
        synagogue (SA 90:19). Women fulfill it by establishing a permanent
        place to pray at home, a place where she tries to pray constantly. A
        woman whose house bustles with people or children should set a place to
        pray in a secluded corner, so that her concentration is not disrupted
        (see SA 90:20).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must pray in a room with a window, and <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is
good that a window opens toward Jerusalem, so that if her        <em>kavana</em> is disrupted, she can look up towards the heavens (SA
        90:4; MB 90:8). However, one should not establish her place of prayer
        next to a window with a view of the public domain, for whatever is
        happening on the street is likely to disturb her prayer (SA 90:20).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If she is in a place with no windows, she should pray in a well-lit
        place, since some <em>poskim</em> explain that the reason for praying
        in a room with windows is because the light that comes in settles the
        thoughts of the person praying (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>);
        therefore, good lighting can be considered a substitute for a window.

        <a name="_Toc402175228">3. Praying next to a Wall</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Ideally there should be no barrier between one praying the        <em>Amida</em> and the wall, so that nothing distracts her from prayer.
        Permanent furniture standing against the wall, such as a closed
        cupboard, is not considered a barrier since it does not cause
        distraction, and <em>le-khatĥila</em> one may pray next to it (SA
        90:21; MB 63:65).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Pieces of furniture which were made for praying purposes, like        <em>shtenders</em> (lecterns), are not considered barriers. Likewise, a
        table on which one puts her <em>siddur</em> is not considered a
        barrier. However, when the table is of no use, it should not be allowed
to divide the person praying from the wall (MB 90:66;        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3 n. 6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If a person is standing between a woman praying and the wall, if that
        person is also engaged in prayer, he is not considered a barrier.
        However, if he is not engaged in prayer, he is indeed considered a
barrier (SA<em> </em>90:22; Rav Kook in <em>Tov Ro’i </em>on        <em>Berakhot</em> 5b).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is not proper to pray facing pictures, lest it be a distraction (SA
        90:23). However, if the picture is above eye level it is permitted, for
        then there is no concern that people will be distracted by it while
        praying (MA 90:37; MB<em> </em>71).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One may not pray facing a mirror because one who does so looks like she
        is bowing to her own reflection. Therefore, even if she were to close
        her eyes, it is still forbidden (MB 90:71). <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, one
        should not pray at night in front of a window in which her image is
reflected, since looking at her reflection will likely disturb her        <em> kavana</em>. But if there is no alternative, she should close her
        eyes or look in the <em>siddur</em>. Since the window does not reflect
        her image clearly like a mirror does, she does not really seem to be
        bowing to her reflection (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3
        n. 7).

        <a name="_Toc402175229">4. One May Not Pray in a High Place</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who stands before God in prayer should know that her existence and
        all of life’s blessings are dependent on God’s kindness and that God is
        not required to fulfill her requests; hence, she should stand before
Him humbly. That is what the Sages meant when they said (        <em>Berakhot</em> 10b): "One may not stand on a chair, on a stool, or
        on any other high place and pray, because there is no haughtiness
        before the Omnipresent, as it says (Tehilim 130:1): ‘From the depths I
        called You, Lord.’" The Talmud (<em>Ta’anit</em> 23b) relates a story
        about R. Yona who was known as a righteous person whose prayers were
        answered. When he was asked to pray for rain, he went to a low place in
        order to fulfill the verse: "From the depths I called You, Lord." He
        prayed there until he was answered and rain began to fall. For that
        reason, it is customary in some congregations that the <em>ĥazan</em>’s
        place is lower. This also explains why the <em>ĥazan</em> is described
        as "descending before the ark" ("<em>yored lifnei ha-teiva</em>").
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
As a rule, the Sages prohibited an elevated place higher than three        <em>tefaĥim</em> (c. 24 cm) above the ground. However, in practice, it
        is forbidden to pray even on a less elevated place, for two reasons.
        First, one standing on a stepstool or rock even only one <em>tefaĥ</em>
        in height is worried about losing her balance and cannot have the
        proper<em> kavana </em>while praying. Second, if the floor is even,
        elevating oneself on pillows, cushions, or anything else suggests a
        sense of haughtiness, and it is improper to pray in such a manner.
        Nevertheless, praying on rugs and mats which are normally laid out on
        the floor is permitted <em>le-khatĥila</em>. Likewise, one who prays on
        uneven ground may stand on the elevated parts, as long as they are not
three <em>tefaĥim</em> higher than the rest of their surroundings (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3 n. 4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A sick or elderly person who has trouble getting out of bed may pray in
        bed, even though it is elevated from the ground, for that does not
        display haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If the high place stands on its own – for instance, it is wider than
        four <em>amot</em> by four <em>amot</em> (c. two meters by two meters)
        – one may pray on it, because it is not measured in relation to other
        places. Rather it is considered its own domain. Even an area which is
        smaller than four <em>amot</em> squared is considered to be its own
        domain if it is surrounded by partitions, and it is permissible to pray
        on it.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One may not recite the <em>Amida</em> prayer too close to his primary
        rabbi ("<em>rav muvhak</em>"), for if he prays alongside him, and
        certainly in front of him, he presents himself as his rabbi’s equal at
        least. On the other hand, he may not pray behind his rabbi, for should
        the rabbi finish praying before he does, the rabbi will feel
        uncomfortable because he cannot take three steps backwards – and it
        would be terrible for one to make his mentor feel uncomfortable.
        Furthermore, the student may appear as though he is bowing down to his
        rabbi (SA 90:24; MB 74).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If the student distances himself by four <em>amot</em> (c. two meters),
        it is permitted. However, if he prays behind his rabbi, he must
        distance himself four <em>amot</em> and another three paces (c. 60 cm),
        so that even if he were to prolong his prayer, his rabbi would be able
        to take three steps backwards.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Who is considered one’s primary rabbi? The one from whom she has
        learned the majority of her wisdom in one area of the Torah. One of the
        great Torah leaders of the generation has the same status. Likewise,
        the rabbi of a place is considered a primary rabbi (AHS YD<em> </em>
        242:29; see also <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3 n. 8). Some
        say that during the time period that one is learning from a certain
        rabbi, even if he did not teach her most of her knowledge, at that
time, the teacher has the status of her primary rabbi (        <em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 2:74).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Concerning a <em>rabbanit </em>(a rabbi’s wife, who is often a teacher
        and religious guide in her own right), there is a prohibition on
        praying alongside her in two situations: 1. when she is married to
        one’s <em>rav muvhak</em> or to one of the prominent Torah leaders of
        the generation, and her main goal is to assist her husband in his
        sacred mission; and 2. when she herself is an educator and most of her
        students’ Torah knowledge or teaching has come from her, in which case,
        her students must relate to her as they would to a <em>rav muvhak</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Some say that these rulings apply only in a situation where the student
        chooses to pray next to the <em>rabbanit</em>. But if they were seated
        near each other in the women’s section, she may pray there, for there
        is no question of arrogance on the part of the student. In times of
        need, one may rely on this opinion (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>,
        ch. 3 n. 9). Certainly when the <em>rabbanit</em> invites the student
        to sit next to her or agrees to the student sitting next to her there
        is no prohibition or concern of arrogance on the part of the student,
        and she may pray there.

        <a name="_Toc402175231">6. Prayer in Open Areas</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One should not recite the <em>Amida</em> in an open area, and one who
        does so is called "insolent" (<em>Berakhot</em> 34b), because in an
        open area one’s thoughts scatter, whereas in a private place place the
        King’s awe is upon her and her heart is humbled (SA 90:5). Furthermore,
        in an open space, there is concern that people will pass by and disturb
        her concentration. Those who are traveling may pray along their way,
        and if there are trees there, it is better to pray among them (MB
        90:11). Similarly, it is preferable to pray next to a wall than in a
        completely open area (<em>Eshel Avraham </em>[<em>Buczacz</em>] 90:5).
        A courtyard surrounded by walls is considered a private place, almost
        like a house, since the defining factor is the presence of walls, not a
        ceiling (MB<em> </em>90:12).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
It is permissible <em>le-khatĥila</em> to pray in the plaza of the        <em>Kotel</em> (the Western Wall) because it is surrounded by walls on
        three sides. Moreover, the holiness of the site reinforces one’s love
and awe of God, causing one’s prayer to be said with more<em> kavana</em>. The patriarch Yitzĥak did this when he recited        <em>Minĥa</em> on Mount Moriah, which was then an open field, as it
says: "Yitzĥak went out to meditate in the field" (Bereishit 24:63;        <em>Berakhot</em> 26b; <em>Midrash Tehillim</em> §81).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is forbidden to pray in front of a synagogue because if person
        praying faces the direction of Jerusalem, her back will be
        disrespectfully turned towards the synagogue. If she faces the
        synagogue, her back will be turned to Jerusalem, in the opposite
        direction towards which the congregants inside are praying. However,
        one may pray alongside the synagogue or behind it when facing Jerusalem
        (SA 90:7).

            7. Cleanliness of the Area from Excrement and Foul Odors
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is forbidden to say or think about sacred matters in a place that
        contains feces or other foul-smelling substances, as the Torah states:
        "You will return and cover your excrement. This is because Lord your
        God walks among you in your camp…. Your camp must therefore be holy"
        (Devarim 23:14-15). This law contains many details, and we will learn
        only a few of them.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Anything within four <em>amot</em> (c. two meters) of a person is
        considered to be within her "camp." Hence, if there is excrement within
        her four <em>amot</em>, her camp is not holy and she may not pray
        there. If the excrement is in front of her, as long as she sees it, she
may not pray. If the smell spreads, she must distance herself four        <em>amot</em> from the place where the smell dissipates. Even one whose
        sense of smell is impaired must distance herself, like one who smells
        the odor (SA 79:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        This law applies to anything rancid whose stench revolts people. Thus,
        one must distance herself from a carcass and from malodorous animal
        dung just as she must distance herself from human feces (MB 79:23).
        Foul-smelling vomit has the same status as excrement, but if it does
        not stink, some rule leniently and do not consider it like feces (see
        MB 76:20 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 51:12).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When the odor spreads to another domain, for example, from the bathroom
        into the next room, one may not recite sacred words anywhere that the
        smell pervades. Some <em>poskim</em> are stringent and maintain that
even when the foul odor comes from another domain, one must move four<em>amot</em> away from the place where the smell ends, and<em>le-khatĥila</em> this opinion is worth following (MB 79:17 and        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>79:1; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3 n.
        10).

        <a name="_Toc402175233">8. What is the Law <em>Be-di’avad</em>?</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one recited the <em>Amida</em> within four <em>amot</em> of feces,
        she did not fulfill her obligation, and the <em>Amida </em>must be
        repeated<em>. </em>Even if she was unaware that there was excrement
        there, but there was a reasonable concern that the place would contain
        excrement, she acted negligently by not examining the cleanliness of
        the place before praying, and therefore she did not fulfill her
        obligation. However, if the place was unlikely to contain excrement,
        since she was not required to check, she fulfilled her obligation (SA
        76:8; MB 76:31 and 81:13).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about one who recited <em>berakhot</em>
        within four <em>amot</em> of excrement. Some say that because she
        transgressed a biblical prohibition, she did not fulfill her obligation
and must repeat all the <em>berakhot</em> (MB 185:7; BHL        <em>ad loc.</em>). Others maintain that the Sages are only strict about
        the recitation of <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Amida</em>, but concerning
        other <em>berakhot</em>, <em>be-di’avad</em> she fulfilled her
obligation (<em>Ĥayei Adam </em>3:33; <em>Kitzur </em>SA 5:10;        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>76:37, 185:14). Since this is a matter of dispute
        concerning <em>berakhot</em>, and repeating the <em>berakha</em> raises
        concerns about making a <em>berakha le-vatala</em>, the principle of
leniency in matters of uncertainty about <em>berakhot </em>("<em>safek berakhot le-hakel</em>") applies, and she may not repeat the<em>berakha</em>. It is best that she meditates on the words of the        <em>berakha</em>, for some <em>poskim</em> maintain that one fulfills
        the obligation to recite a <em>berakha</em> just by thinking it
        (Rambam), and the prohibition to recite a <em>berakha le-vatala</em>
        does not apply to thought.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Feces of young infants do not smell that bad and therefore it does not
        have the status of excrement. When a child reaches the age that he can
eat a <em>kezayit</em> of cereal grain within a        <em>shi’ur akhilat pras </em>(the time it takes to eat half a loaf of
        bread; c. 6-7 minutes), one must distance herself from the excrement as
        she would from an adult’s excrement (SA 81:1); some write that this
        starts at one year of age. Speaking sacred words near a baby’s feces is
        only permitted in extenuating circumstances. <em>Le-khatĥila</em> it is
        better to distance oneself from the excrement of even a week-old baby
        when speaking sacred words (MB 81:3; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>1:6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When praying near a baby at least one year old who is still in diapers,
        one should first make sure that no foul odor is present. If there is a
        foul odor and it reaches the person praying, she must stop her prayers.
        However, as long as the child does not smell, she may pray near him,
        for even if he did defecate, since the feces are covered in a diaper
        and clothing and there is no scent, it is not forbidden to speak sacred
        words near him.

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When a woman is in the middle of the <em>Amida</em> and her child comes
        to her with a dirty, smelly diaper, she may not continue praying. If
        someone else can take care of the child, she must signal with her hands
        that they should distance the child from her, and then she can continue
        her prayers. However, when no one else is present to care for the child
        at that moment, she should, if possible, place him in a crib or in a
        different room where he can play until she completes her prayer. If no
        such option is available – for example, if the child is crying and
        requires her attention – since she is prohibited from continuing to
        pray while he is next to her anyway, she must stop praying, clean the
        child, change his diaper, and wash her hands. She should try to return
        to her prayer as quickly as possible, because if the interruption is
shorter than the time it takes for her to recite the whole        <em>Amida</em>, she may continue praying from the place where she
        stopped. If in her estimation, however, the interruption lasts longer
        that the time it would take her to recite the entire <em>Amida</em>,
        from start to finish, she must begin the <em>Amida</em> from the
        beginning (SA 104:5).

If a soiled child approaches a woman while she is reciting a short        <em>berakha</em>, she should distance herself from him to a place where
        the odor cannot be smelled and then finish the <em>berakha</em>. If she
        is reciting <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>, which takes more time to say, and
she cannot distance herself from him long enough to complete all four        <em>berakhot </em>of <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> because he is crying and
        she needs to pick him up to calm him down, since she cannot continue
        her <em>berakha </em>while she smells his excrement anyway, she should
        clean him, change his diaper, wash her hands, and continue from the
        beginning of the <em>berakha</em> at which she stopped (SA<em> </em>

        A woman who is facing the bathroom may recite sacred words and pray as
        the door is closed and no foul odor reaches her. If the door is open,
        she may not pray there. However, if her back or side is turned towards
        the bathroom, as long as no foul smell reaches her, she may pray and
        recite sacred words (SA 83:1; MB 83:5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Occasionally, a sewer emits a stench into a nearby home or synagogue.
        In such a case, it is forbidden to pray inside. Sometimes closing the
        windows that face the sewer helps, and if the odor lingers, air
        freshener can be used to eliminate it. In the past, people would
        eliminate a stench by burning a garment (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>79:20).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The status of a particular smell depends on accepted local norms. In
        the past, sewage, including feces and urine, would flow alongside
        streets, and the air in crowded cities was full of foul odors. Even so,
        prayers would be recited in synagogues and houses near the sewage
        canals because everyone was accustomed to them and did not consider
        them foul. Only on summer days or when the sewage canals were clogged
        would the stench intensify to the point that people would not pray
        nearby (see MB 79:5). Nowadays, however, sewage is drained, the air is
        purer, and we are more sensitive to bad smells; hence, wherever we
        sense a foul odor by today’s standards, it is forbidden to pray.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Similarly, in farming communities, the smell from the barns and chicken
        coops that regularly reaches homes and synagogues is not considered by
        the local residents to be a bad smell. The same smell in the city may
        be considered foul, and it is prohibited to pray as long as it
        persists. Those who are guests in communities like these should follow
        the local custom.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        People who pray outside must be careful not to pray in close proximity
        to garbage bins that smell bad. Even when the garbage cans do not emit
        a foul odor, it is proper not to pray within four <em>amot</em> of them
        or facing them.

11. The Prohibition of Reciting Sacred Words in the Presence of "            <em>Erva</em>"
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
It is prohibited to recite sacred words in the presence of        <em>erva</em> (nakedness), as the Torah states: "Your camp must
        therefore be holy. Let Him not see any <em>erva</em> among you and turn
        away from you" (Devarim 23:15). Regarding a man who sees another man or
        a woman who sees another woman, it is only prohibited to recite sacred
        words in view of the other’s privates. Therefore, if a woman is sitting
        on the floor or a chair in a manner that conceals her private part,
        even if she is naked, another woman may pray or speak sacred words in
        her presence (MB 75:8).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        However, from the perspective of modesty, it is not proper for a woman
        to sit without clothing (above, 4:2). When necessary, it is
        permissible, and in such a case there is no prohibition for another
        woman to recite sacred words in her presence.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Concerning a man who sees a woman, the Sages teach (<em>Berakhot</em><strong> </strong>24b), "A <em>tefaĥ</em> of a woman is considered        <em>erva</em>." What they meant is that it is forbidden to reveal any
        part of a woman’s body which is normally covered, and that if such a
        part is exposed, one may not speak sacred words its presence (the
specifics of this rule are explained in SA<em> </em>§75 and in<em>Peninei Halakha</em>:        <em>Collected Essays IIICollected Essays III</em> 6:3-6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Although we must educate girls to dress modestly starting from a young
age, the prohibition against speaking sacred words in the presence of a        <em>tefaĥ</em> that is normally covered begins when the girl begins to
        mature (<em>ibid</em>. 6:7).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Likewise, regarding the hair on one’s head, the Sages teach: "A woman’s
        hair is <em>erva</em>" (<em>Berakhot</em> 24a). This refers to a
        married woman, and if her hair is not covered, a man may not recite
        sacred words in her presence (the specific of the laws of hair covering
        are detailed in <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Collected Essays III</em>
        6:14-15).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A man who must pray, recite <em>berakhot</em>, or learn Torah and finds
        himself in the presence of a woman who is revealing a <em>tefaĥ</em> of
        areas that are normally covered, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, he should turn
        away so that he cannot see her. If he cannot turn away, he must look
        into his <em>siddur</em>, or close his eyes, and only then speak sacred
        words (SA 75:6; MB 75:1, 29).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Concerning hair covering, some Aĥaronim write that since,
        unfortunately, many married women do not cover their hair, uncovered
        hair has become, to some degree, something that not everyone is
        accustomed to covering, and <em>be-di’avad</em> one may speak sacred
        words in its presence. This only pertains to hair, regarding which has
        a more lenient status than other normally covered parts, as single
        women are not obligated to cover their hair. However, concerning the
        normally covered parts of the body, which even single women must cover,
        as we have learned, one may not be lenient; rather, he must close his
eyes or look in a <em>siddur</em> (AHS 75:7; <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>,<em>Bo</em> 12; <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OĤ 1:44; see        <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Collected Essays III</em> 6:16).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Similarly, a man may not recite sacred words near a woman who is
singing (SA 75:3). However, according to some Aĥaronim,        <em>be-di’avad</em>, hearing a female singer on the radio does not
        prohibit reciting matters of sanctity (see <em>ibid</em>. 6:11).

            This is based on Ramban’s approach, as explained above, 2:2 n. 1,
            where we learned that according to Ramban and most <em>poskim</em>,
            the Sages instituted <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> as
obligatory for women. Even though these prayers are time-bound            <em>mitzvot</em>, women are required to recite them, since they too
            must request mercy. Rambam (according to the accepted
            interpretation) maintains that prayer is a biblical commandment
            independent of time, whose obligation is once a day, regarding
            which women are commanded from the Torah. Following the
            establishment of the specific times for the prayers by the Sages,
            women must also pray at the designated times for <em>Shaĥarit</em>
            or <em>Minĥa</em>, as explained above, 2:3 n. 2.

            The <em>poskim</em> disagree about feces that are in a different
            domain or are covered. All agree that it is forbidden to speak
            sacred words anywhere the odor reaches. The dispute is about
            whether it is necessary to distance oneself by four <em>amot</em>
            from the place where the smell ends. Some are stringent, though
most <em>poskim</em> are lenient (see            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 3 n. 10). This also applies
            to the feces of a baby that are covered in a diaper and
            undergarments: one may not speak sacred words anywhere the foul
            odor reaches, and the <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether one
            must distance herself by an additional four <em>amot</em> from
            there. If the baby’s odor is completely undetectable, there is no
            need to move away, and it has the status of covered feces (SA
            79:1-2). Therefore, as long as one does not smell a bad odor from
            the child, there is no need to check the child’s diaper; this is
            the prevalent custom. MA 81:1 rules very stringently that one may
            not pray next to a baby under any circumstances. However, this
            opinion was not accepted by most <em>poskim</em>, as explained in
            SAH<em> </em>76:6 and <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>81:7.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<em>Halikhot Shlomo</em>: Prayer 20:4-5)
            also rules that one may pray near a baby who does not smell and
            there is no need to check him. However he adds a novel insight: If
            the person praying knows that the baby defecated in his diaper, the
            diaper has the status of a <em>graf shel re’i</em> (a vessel that
            holds feces, such as a chamber pot), which in turn has the status
of actual feces even if it does not smell. Thus, one must move four            <em>amot </em>away from a baby with a dirty diaper unless there is
            another piece of clothing on top of the diaper and there is no foul
            odor. If the baby urinated in his diaper, even if he is not wearing
            clothes, one may pray near him as long as there is no foul smell.
            Some disagree and maintain that since diapers are either disposable
            or cloth, and is thrown out or laundered after each use, they are
            not considered a <em>graf shel re’i</em> (R. Nisim Karelitz, cited
            in <em>Ve-zot Ha-berakha</em> p. 150. R. Auerbach further states
            that one may bring a baby to synagogue when he is diapered and
            dressed, and there is no need to be concerned that he might
            defecate.
