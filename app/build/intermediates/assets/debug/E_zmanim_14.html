    Chapter Fourteen: The Month of Adar
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>14.1 – When Adar Arrives We Increase Joy </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages state, “When Av arrives we decrease joy, and when Adar arrives we increase joy” (<em>Ta’anit</em> 29a). By this, the Rabbis wanted to teach us
    that nothing happens by chance and that every time period has its own character and nature. If both Temples were destroyed on the ninth of Av, it is a sign
    that the beginning of Av is naturally predisposed to calamity. And if the miracle of Purim occurred in the middle of the month of Adar, it is a sign that
    this month has the ability to transform bad into good. We feel ordinary joy over the good that exists in the world, but our joy is not complete, because
    there is still evil and pain in the world. However, when even the bad turns into good, our joy is great and complete. This is what happened on Purim. The
    Holy One, blessed be He, turned the bad into good and saved His nation Israel. This taught us that everything that happens in the world, even the bad,
    eventually turns around and becomes good. The more we increase our faith [in God] and study Torah, the closer we will bring the [ultimate] redemption, when
    all evil will turn into good, and joy will abound in the world. Since the month of Adar has the unique character of transforming bad into good, “We
    increase joy when Adar arrives.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Sages further recommend (ibid. 29b) that a Jew who has a legal issue or business deal to settle with a Gentile should evade him during the month of Av,
    because the Jews have bad <em>mazal</em> (“luck”) during that month. Instead, he should try to make himself available for litigation or a deal during the
    month of Adar, because that is when Israel’s <em>mazal</em> prevails.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>14.2 – The Four Parshiot </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
Our Sages instituted the reading of four portions of the Torah [during this time of year]: <em>Shekalim</em>, <em>Zachor</em>, <em>Parah</em>, and    <em>HaChodesh</em>. We generally read them on the Sabbaths of the month of Adar, except for the first one, which is usually read on the Sabbath before Adar
    begins.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    On these Sabbaths, we take out two Torah scrolls from the ark, reading the regular weekly portion, with seven <em>aliyot</em>, from the first scroll and
    the special <em>parashah</em>, as <em>maftir</em>, from the second scroll. And since the <em>Haftarah</em>, from the Prophets, has to relate to what was
    read in <em>maftir</em>, the <em>Haftarot</em> of these weeks deal with a theme connected to the <em>parashah</em> that was read in the second scroll and
    not to the weekly portion that was read in the first.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    On the first Shabbat, we read <em>Parashat Shekalim</em> (<em>Shemot</em> 28:9-15), as a reminder to contribute the yearly half-shekel, from which communal
    sacrifices are purchased. Beginning with the month of Nissan, all sacrifices must be bought with money from the new collection. Therefore, the Rabbis
    instituted the reading of <em>Parashat Shekalim</em> a month earlier, to remind every Jew to bring in his donation. Even though the Temple is destroyed
today, and we do not have the privilege to offer sacrifices, we still read <em>Parashat Shekalim</em>, in commemoration of what was done in the Temple (see    <em>M.B.</em> 685:1, <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> 3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The second <em>parashah</em> is <em>Zachor</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 25:17-19). This reading fulfills a biblical commandment to remember what the Amalekites
    did to us. The Rabbis ordained that we read this <em>parashah</em> before Purim in order to juxtapose the <em>mitzvah</em> of remembering Amalek to the
    holiday in which we celebrate its fulfillment. After all, Haman was a descendent of Amalek, and we eliminated him on Purim.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In <em>Parashat Parah</em> (<em>BeMidbar</em> 19:1-22), the third one, we learn how one purifies himself from ritual impurity in order to enter the    <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> and offer sacrifices. The Rabbis instituted that we read this in advance of the month of Nissan so that people can prepare and
    purify themselves for the upcoming <em>Pesach</em> sacrifice. Even though we do not offer this sacrifice nowadays, we read <em>Parashat Parah</em> in
    commemoration of what was done in the Temple.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The fourth <em>parashah</em> is <em>HaChodesh</em> (<em>Shemot</em> 12:1-20), which mentions the sanctification of the new moon and the <em>mitzvot</em>
surrounding <em>Pesach</em>. We read it on the eve of Nissan because Nissan is the first month of the Jewish calendar. In addition, reading this    <em>parashah</em> motivates us to start preparing for Passover and all its <em>mitzvot</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When Rosh Chodesh Adar or Nissan coincides with <em>Shabbat</em>, we remove three Torah scrolls from the ark. We read the weekly portion from the first
one, the section that deals with <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> [<em>BeMidbar</em> 28:9-15] from the second one, and the special <em>parashah</em> –    <em>Shekalim</em> on Rosh Chodesh Adar and <em>HaChodesh</em> on Rosh Chodesh Nissan – from the third scroll.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to most <em>poskim</em>, the <em>mitzvah</em> of reading <em>Parashat Zachor</em> is biblically ordained. Therefore, people are more careful
    about its observance than all the other readings, as we will explain below (14.6). Some say that <em>Parashat Parah</em> also fulfills a biblical
    commandment, which is why people are accustomed to treating it more scrupulously.

</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>14.3 – Leap Years and the First Adar</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is well known that the [Jewish] months are established according to the lunar cycle, while the years follow the solar cycle. The reason for this is that
    Pesach must always coincide with the spring season, as it says,
    <em>
        Observe the month of Aviv (spring) and make a pesach-offering to the Lord your God, for in the month of Aviv (spring) the Lord your God took you out of
        Egypt at night
    </em>
    (<em>Devarim</em> 16:1). In order to keep the months in sync with the solar year, we must establish a leap year every so often. That is, we add a month
    onto the year, making it thirteen months long. The only month that may be added is the month of Adar, and by doing so we postpone the month of Nissan and
    cause it to coincide with spring. In the past, a rabbinic court (<em>beit din</em>) would decide to create a leap year based on agricultural concerns and
    yearly calculations. Today, however, since we do not have [properly] ordained [judges and] courts, the Sages established a fixed cycle of nineteen years,
    of which twelve are ordinary years and seven are leap years.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    On a leap year, we celebrate Purim during the second Adar, in order to juxtapose the joy of the Purim-salvation to the exodus from Egypt. We also read the
    Four <em>Parshiot</em> during this month because <em>Shekalim</em>, <em>Parah</em>, and <em>HaChodesh</em> were instituted as a preparation for the month
    of Nissan, and <em>Zachor</em> has to be read [immediately] before Purim, which is celebrated in the second Adar, as well (see <em>Megillah</em> 6b).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Nonetheless, the first Adar has a certain festiveness to it. Therefore, we do not fast, deliver eulogies, or recite <em>Tachanun</em> (supplication prayer)
    on the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month. It is also proper to eat a special meal on the fourteenth of Adar I, which is called <em>Purim Katan</em>
    (“the Small Purim”) (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>Rama</em> 697:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Moreover, when the Sages enjoined us to increase joy when Adar arrives, they seemingly meant when the first Adar arrives. (See the footnote regarding the
    proper time to celebrate a bar mitzvah or observe a <em>yahrtzeit</em>).

<a name="4"></a><h2>14.4 – The Three Mitzvot Concerning the Obliteration of Amalek </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
Three <em>mitzvot</em> in the Torah relate to Amalek. The first is a positive commandment to remember what Amalek did to us, as it says,    <em>Remember what Amalek did to you on the way when you were leaving Egypt</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 25:17). The second is a negative commandment not to
    forget what Amalek did to us, as it says, <em>Do not forget</em> (ibid. 25:19). The third is a positive commandment to eradicate Amalek’s offspring from
    the world, as it says,
    <em>
        It shall be that when the Lord your God gives you rest from all your enemies around, in the Land that the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance to
        possess it, you shall obliterate the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens
    </em>
    (ibid.).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Amalekite people symbolize the root of evil in the world, and they introduced Jew-hatred to mankind. The Jewish people face a difficult struggle in
    this world. The idealistic, faith-based message that HaShem destined to Israel incites all the evildoers of the world to go out and fight against us. No
    other nation has been persecuted as much as we have been: from the destruction of the Temple through the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Chmielnicki
    Uprising of 1648-49, culminating in the horrific Holocaust that ravaged our nation. Amalek started it all.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Right after we left Egypt, even before we had a chance to coalesce and organize ourselves, Amalek came and attacked us, without any provocation or reason.
    And who did he attack? Slaves who were going free after an extended period of servitude. Amalek is the nation that embodies hatred of Israel, and
consequently, hatred of Torah and the godly concept of universal rectification through kindness and truth. This is why the verse says,<em>For the hand [of God] is on the throne</em> (כס)<em> of God</em> (י-ה)    <em>, [saying] the Lord will [wage] war against Amalek from generation to generation</em> (<em>Shemot</em> 17:16). Rashi comments, “The Holy One, blessed
    be He, swore that His name (י-ה-ו-ה) and His throne (כסא) will be incomplete until the name of Amalek is utterly obliterated.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Jews are naturally kind and compassionate, and many <em>mitzvot</em> in the Torah cultivate such traits within us. We would, therefore, be inclined to
    forgive Amalek [for his misdeeds], but the Torah commands us to remember what he did and obliterate him. This way, we will remember that there is evil in
    the world, against which we must fight to the bitter end, without compromise. Only then will we be able to perfect the world.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>14.5 – The Mitzvah to Wipe Out Amalek</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>mitzvah</em> to destroy Amalek is mainly incumbent upon <em>Klal Yisrael</em> (the Jewish nation as a whole). Thus, our Sages taught that the Jews
    were commanded to fulfill three <em>mitzvot</em> upon entering <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>: first, to appoint a king over them; afterwards, to wipe out the seed
    of Amalek; and then, to build the Holy Temple (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 20b).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Indeed, after the Jews merged together in their Land, they appointed King Shaul, and after his kingdom stabilized, the prophet Shmuel approached Shaul and
    said to him,
    <em>
        The Lord sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; therefore, hear now the voice of the Lord’s words. So says the Lord of Hosts, “I
        have remembered what Amalek did to Israel, how he set [an ambush] against him on the way, as he [Israel] went up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek
        and destroy everything he has; have no mercy on him; kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey”
    </em>
    (I <em>Shmuel</em> 15:1-3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, King Shaul did not fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> properly, taking pity on Agag, King of Amalek, and the best of the sheep and cattle. As a result,
    HaShem took the kingdom away from him and gave it to David. Nevertheless, the damage was already done, and it was devastating. Because of Shaul’s weakness
    and compassion, many Amalekites survived, and they continued harassing Israel. A few years later, a band of Amalekites attacked Tziklag, where the families
    of David and his men lived, burning down the city and taking all the women and children captive. With God’s help, David and his men managed to rescue the
    captives and vanquish the marauders. But since David was not yet king and did not have the army of Israel at his disposal, he was unable to eradicate them.
    Four hundred youths rode on camels and escaped (I <em>Shmuel</em> 30). Apparently, other groups of Amalekites survived elsewhere, but despite his efforts
    David was unable to battle and destroy them all, even after he became king, because they were spread out far and wide. <em>Chazal</em> also tell us that
    because Shaul procrastinated in killing Agag, Agag’s seed was preserved – [he impregnated a woman from his prison cell before being killed] – eventually
    resulting in the birth of Haman the Aggagite, who attempted to wipe out the Jewish people (<em>Megillah</em> 13a).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though the <em>mitzvah</em> to eradicate Amalek is mainly incumbent upon the community, every individual Jew is commanded to fulfill it, as well.
Therefore, if a Jew meets an Amalekite, and has the ability to kill him, but refrains from doing so, he has neglected this <em>mitzvah</em> (    <em>Sefer HaChinuch</em> 604). The descendants of Amalek are currently unknown, but if one would ascertain that a particular person is an Amalekite, who
    follows their ways, it would be a <em>mitzvah</em> to kill him.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>14.6 – Parashat Zachor </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages instituted the reading of <em>Parashat Zachor</em> once a year in order to fulfill the biblical commandments to remember and not forget the evil
    deeds of Amalek. One is considered to have forgotten about Amalek only if a year goes by without remembering him. Therefore, we discharge our obligation by
    mentioning the matter once a year. We read <em>Zachor</em> on the Sabbath before Purim in order to juxtapose the remembering of Amalek to the destruction
    of his descendent, Haman.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to biblical law, one must communicate this remembrance verbally. There is no need, however, for every individual to read <em>Parashat Zachor</em>
    from a Torah scroll; rather, everyone fulfills the <em>mitzvah</em> by hearing the reader chant the verses from the Torah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to some of the greatest <em>Rishonim</em>, the Torah commands us to read <em>Parashat Zachor</em> from the Torah scroll itself [as opposed to a
    printed <em>Chumash</em>]. Therefore, it is advisable to read it from an exceptional Torah scroll, and the reader must try to read it as meticulously as
    possible.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Preferably, everyone should hear <em>Zachor</em> read according to the melody and pronunciation to which his family is accustomed. From a halachic
    standpoint, however, members of all the communities may discharge their obligation by hearing it read according to any version accepted among the Jewish
    people, whether it be Sefardic, Ashkenazic, or Yemenite.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
One who finds himself in a place where there is no <em>minyan</em> (a quorum of ten) should read <em>Zachor</em> from a Torah scroll without a    <em>minyan</em>. And if no Torah scroll is available, he should read it from a <em>Chumash</em> or a <em>Siddur</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>Mitzvot</em>
require intent; therefore, one must have intention to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of remembering Amalek’s deeds when reading or hearing    <em>Parashat Zachor</em>. It is a good practice for the <em>gabbai</em> (synagogue attendant) or reader to announce this before commencing the reading.
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>14.7 – Are Women Obligated to Hear Parashat Zachor? </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
According to most <em>poskim</em>, women are exempt from the <em>mitzvah</em> of remembering Amalek, because this <em>mitzvah</em> is connected to the<em>mitzvah</em> of annihilating Amalek, and since women are not commanded to wage war, they need not remember what Amalek did to us (    <em>Sefer HaChinuch</em> 603). Others claim that the <em>mitzvah</em> to wage war applies to women, as well, for they are required to assist the soldiers.
    Therefore, they, too, are obligated to remember Amalek. And even though the Sages established a fixed time for reading <em>Parashat Zachor</em> – the
    Sabbath before Purim – it has no time limit according to Torah law. Thus, it is a <em>mitzvah</em> independent of time, and women are obligated to perform
    it (<em>Minchat Chinuch</em>, ibid.).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Practically speaking, women are exempt from hearing <em>Parashat Zachor</em>. Ideally (<em>le’chatchilah</em>), however, women should hear the reading, and
    many are accustomed to doing so. A woman who finds it difficult to attend the services, but nevertheless wants to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em>, should read
    the <em>parashah</em> herself from a <em>Chumash</em>. After all, many authorities hold that this fulfills the biblical requirement to remember Amalek. If
    there is a class for women in the synagogue, [a man] may take out a Torah scroll and read <em>Zachor</em> for them. Even though no <em>minyan</em> is
    present, it is commendable for them to hear the <em>parashah</em> from a kosher Torah scroll.
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>14.8 – Can an Amalekite Save Himself or Convert to Judaism? </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though the Torah commands us to wipe out the descendants of Amalek, if one of them agrees to keep the seven Noachide laws, he no longer has the status
    of an Amalekite, and it is forbidden to kill him. The seven Noachide laws are as follows: the prohibitions against idolatry, adultery, murder, theft,
    blasphemy, and eating the limbs of a live animal; and the obligation to set up a court system that will adjudicate all interpersonal disputes justly.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Moreover, even if the Amalekites do not volunteer to keep the seven Noachide laws, we are commanded to offer them peace before going to war with them. That
    is, we offer them the opportunity to adopt the seven Noachide laws and agree to be subservient to the Jewish people, including the payment of tributes. If
    they accept these conditions of peace, we do not wage war against them. If they refuse, however, we fight them to the finish. Even if they reconsider
    afterwards and beg for peace, we do not accept them, for once the war has begun we fight them until they are annihilated (Rambam, <em>Hilchot Melachim</em>
    6:1-4, with <em>Kesef Mishnah</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>poskim</em> dispute whether or not we accept an Amalekite who wants to convert to Judaism. The Rambam (<em>Hilchot Issurei Bi’ah</em> 12:17) holds
that he may convert. Accordingly, <em>Chazal</em> state that descendants of Haman, himself a descendant of Amalek, taught Torah in B’nei Brak (    <em>Gittin</em> 57b, <em>Sanhedrin</em> 96b). Clearly, [our forebears] accepted converts from Amalek.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Others assert that we do not accept Amalekite converts. This is Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion in the <em>Mechilta</em> (end of <em>BeShalach</em>). He relates
    that HaShem swore by His glorious throne that an Amalekite who comes to convert will not be accepted. And what about <em>Chazal</em>’s statement that
    Haman’s descendants taught Torah in B’nei Brak? [We must say that] this happened by mistake: a <em>beit din</em> (rabbinic court) converted someone without
    knowing that he was from Amalek. Alternatively, an Amalekite from the wicked Haman’s lineage raped a Jewish woman, and those Torah teachers from B’nei Brak
    descended from her son, who was considered a Jew (<em>Resisei Laylah</em> 38:5).

</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>14.9 – The Fast of Esther</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    All Jews have a custom, originating in the Gaonic period, to fast on the thirteenth of Adar in commemoration of the fasts that Esther observed before
    approaching King Achashveirosh to annul the decree (<em>Esther</em> 4:16) and the fast that the Jews observed on the thirteenth of Adar of that year. The
    wicked Haman decreed that all Jews – young and old, men, women, and children – be destroyed, killed, annihilated, and plundered on the thirteenth of Adar.
    Thanks to the Purim miracle, the hanging of Haman, and the rise of Mordechai and Esther, King Achashveirosh issued a second letter allowing the Jews to
    defend themselves and kill their enemies on that same day. The original decree, however, was not rescinded, because any decree written and signed by the
    king could not be annulled. Therefore, the enemies of Israel also had permission to kill the Jews. In other words, the kingdom established the thirteenth
    of Adar as the day on which the anti-Semites could destroy the Jews, but the Jews were permitted to fight back. And even though Mordechai was the king’s
    viceroy, the Jews were still in grave danger and in need of divine mercy, to help them overcome and kill their enemies. Therefore, the Jews who could not
    fight stirred themselves to repentance and fasted that day, as is Israel’s practice in times of trouble. And there is no greater penitence than that
    achieved by way of fasting, which purifies man’s material side and returns his spirituality to its natural, central place.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In commemoration of this fast, the Jewish people fast on the thirteenth of Adar every year. We still have enemies who want to destroy us and we still need
    to fast and repent every year anew.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In general, the laws of Ta’anit Esther (the Fast of Esther) are more lenient than those of the other minor fasts, because the other fasts were instituted
    by the Rabbis, while the Fast of Esther was established in consideration of Jewish custom. In practice, though, there is almost no difference between them
    (the note enumerates the differences).
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The laws regarding the prayers and Torah-reading on Ta’anit Esther, for both <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>, are the same as those of all the
    minor fasts. The only difference is that we omit <em>Tachanun</em> and <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> from <em>Minchah</em> (according to Ashkenazim, who usually
    say <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> [on fast days] in both <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>), seeing that it is the day before Purim (<em>M.B.</em> 131:33).
When the thirteenth of Adar coincides with <em>Shabbat</em>, we fast on the Thursday before, and since the fast is not on the eve of Purim, we pray    <em>Minchah</em> as on all other fasts.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>14.10 – In Commemoration of the Half-Shekel </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    People customarily give charity in the month of Adar in commemoration of the half-shekel that the Jews used to donate [to the Temple], in Adar, for the
    purpose of buying communal offerings. The best time to give this charity is immediately before <em>Minchah</em> on Ta’anit Esther, so that the charity can
    combine with the fast and achieve atonement (<em>M.B.</em> 694:4, <em>K.H.C.</em> 25).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some have a custom to give a coin that equals half of the local currency [e.g., half a dollar, half a pound, etc.], while others give three such coins,
    corresponding to the three times it says <em>terumah</em> (donation) in <em>Parashat Shekalim</em> (<em>Rema</em> 694:1). The common coin in Israel today
    is the shekel, so, according to this custom, one should donate three half-shekel coins.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some are accustomed to giving the equivalent of the [original] half-shekel, which is approximately ten grams of pure silver (<em>K.H.C.</em> 694:20). All
    of the customs are valid, and the more charity one gives the more blessing he receives.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Some hold that this custom applies only to men above the age of twenty, because they were obligated in this <em>mitzvah</em> [in Temple times] (    <em>Rema</em>). Others say that boys above the age of thirteen must uphold this custom, as well (<em>Tosafot Yom Tov</em>). A third opinion believes that
    one should give a donation in commemoration of the half-shekel for young children, too (<em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, <em>M.B.</em> 694:5). Still others maintain
    that even women should give the half-shekel donation (<em>K.H.C.</em> 694:27). This is the most prevalent custom today, to donate at least one half-shekel
    for every member of the house, even an unborn fetus.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should not use <em>ma’aser kesafim</em> money [one-tenth of one’s earnings set aside for charity] for this donation, for one is not allowed to fulfill
    an obligatory <em>mitzvah</em> or custom using <em>ma’aser kesafim</em> funds. However, one who has always performed the half-shekel commemoration
    according to the most stringent view and is now pressed for funds, making it difficult to uphold his custom without relying on <em>ma’aser kesafim</em>,
    may perform the <em>mitzvah</em> with his own money, according to the more lenient opinion – that is, a half-shekel per male above the age of twenty – and
    make up the rest with <em>ma’aser kesafim</em> money.

            According to the order of the Four <em>Parshiot</em>, at least one <em>Shabbat</em> in Adar is left without a <em>parashah</em>, and the Rabbis
            provided a mnemonic to help us remember which one to skip: ז-טו, ב-ו, ד-ד, ו-ביו. That is, if the first of Adar falls on the seventh (ז) day of the
            week (i.e. <em>Shabbat</em>), we do not read any of the [special] <em>parashiot</em> on the fifteenth (טו) of the month. If the first of Adar falls
on a Monday (ב), no <em>parashah</em> is read on the <em>Shabbat</em> that coincides with the sixth (ו) of the month (when this happens, we read            <em>Shekalim</em> at the end of the month of Shevat). If the first of Adar falls on a Wednesday (ד), we skip the <em>Shabbat</em> that coincides
            with the fourth (ד) of the month. And if the first of Adar falls on a Friday (ו), two Sabbaths are left without a <em>parashah</em> – the second
            (ב) and sixteenth (יו) of the month.

            The Sages instituted the reading of the Four Parshiot before they instituted the reading of the weekly portion. Already in the days of Moshe
            Rabbeinu, there was an edict to read the Torah every <em>Shabbat</em> and on Mondays and Thursdays. However, the division of the Torah into 54
            portions, to allow it to be completed once a year, happened much later. In the era of the <em>Amora’im</em>, the Jewish community in Babylonia had
            such a custom, but the Jews in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> completed the Torah every three years. In contrast, the institution of the Four Parshiot and
            the special readings for the holidays is mentioned already in the <em>Mishnah</em> and the <em>Gemara</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 29a-30b).

            Reading <em>Parashat Zachor</em> is a biblical commandment, as we will explain in <em>halachah</em> 6. Some say that <em>Parashat Parah</em> is
also biblically ordained, as the Shulchan Aruch writes in <em>O.C.</em> 146:2, 685:7. Most authorities consider it a rabbinic enactment: see            <em>M.B.</em> 146:13, 685:15; <em>K.H.C.</em> 28; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 2:18. Ideally, one should treat <em>Parashat Parah</em> as strictly as
            he would <em>Parashat Zachor</em>.

            Twelve lunar months add up to 354 days (plus 8 hours, 48 minutes, and 40 seconds). A solar year, on the other hand, equals 365 days (plus 5 hours,
            55 minutes, and approximately 25 seconds). The following years in the nineteen-year cycle are leap years: 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19. The year 5758
            (1997-1998) began the most recent nineteen-year cycle.

            The <em>Mishnah</em> states, “There is no difference between the first Adar and the second one except the reading of the <em>Megillah</em> and the
            giving of gifts to the poor. The <em>Gemara</em> adds the Four <em>Parshiot</em>. This implies that the two are equal with regard to rejoicing. One
can also infer this from the words of the Magen Avraham and the Gra, in <em>Orach Chayim</em> 568:7. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 1:8,            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 1:1. The Mishnah Berurah (4) writes that no festive meal is needed on the fifteenth of Adar I in walled cities. The
            author of <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> (10:58) asserts that one should eat a special meal on that day in Jerusalem.

            <strong>Bar Mitzvah</strong>
            : Since the second Adar is paramount, one who was born in Adar on an ordinary year becomes a bar mitzvah in the second Adar, if that year happens
            to be a leap year. If, however, he was born in the first Adar of a leap year and his bar mitzvah falls out on a leap year, as well, he marks the

            <strong>Anniversary of Death (<em>Yahrtzeit</em>)</strong>
            : According to Sefardic custom, one who has a <em>yahrtzeit</em> in the month of Adar observes it, in a leap year, during the second Adar, for that
            is the main Adar in terms of Purim and the Four <em>Parshiot</em>. Ashkenazim, however, observe it during the first Adar, in order not to postpone
            the <em>mitzvah</em>. According to them, the second Adar is paramount only with regard to Purim and the Four <em>Parshiot</em>, not other matters.
            Moreover, since the second Adar is more joyous – after all, we celebrate Purim then – it is more appropriate to remember the dead in the first
            Adar. Some Ashkenazim act stringently and observe the <em>yahrtzeit</em> twice (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>Rama</em> 568:7, <em>M.B.</em> 41). An
            Ashkenazi Jew who adopted a custom to fast in honor of a <em>yahrtzeit</em> on both Adars should continue his practice. Similarly, the Magen
            Avraham and Mishnah Berurah (42) write that one who took an explicit oath to fast on a <em>yahrtzeit</em> [which comes out in the month of Adar]
            must fast on both Adars [during a leap year]. But if a person died on a leap year, the family should observe the <em>yahrtzeit</em>, on subsequent
            leap years, in the same Adar on which he died.

            <em>Responsa Kol Mevaser</em>
            (2:42) derives from the Rambam, the Ramban (<em>Shemot</em> 17:16), and the Chinuch (604) that the <em>mitzvah</em> of eradicating Amalek is mainly
            incumbent upon the king and the Jewish people as a whole, but that an individual who can kill an Amalekite must do so.

            I asserted that some Amalekites remained after [Shaul’s misdeed]. This is clear from the <em>Gemara</em> (<em>Bava Batra</em> 21a-b), which states
            that David’s general, Yoav, erred and killed only the men [of Amalek] but not the women, because his school teacher taught him [how to read a verse
            regarding the destruction of Amalek] incorrectly. Now, this took place during the war mentioned in the First Book of <em>Melachim</em>, 11:15-16,
            which was mainly against the Edomites, i.e. the descendants of Eisav, of whom Amalek is only a small part. This implies that there was a group of
            Amalekites there, concerning whom Yoav erred. This proof is cited in <em>Responsa Kol Mevaser</em> 2:42.

            It is clear that mistakes have crept into the [Hebrew] pronunciation of some communities, for all of Israel had a common pronunciation before going
            into exile. Nonetheless, one fulfills his obligation [to hear <em>Parashat Zachor</em>] even by way of an inaccurate pronunciation, for as long as
            a large Jewish community accepts and agrees upon it, it is valid. Even regarding the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Chalitza</em>, where the man and woman
            must say certain verses in Hebrew, we do not insist that they enunciate them according to all the different traditions, and we permit the woman to
            get remarried (<em>Iggrot Moshe</em>, O.C. 3:5). Certainly, then, there is no obligation to read <em>Parashat Zachor</em> according to all the
            different pronunciations. Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach concurs (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 18:1), deriving this from the laws of oaths, where an
            inaccurate wording is still considered a full-fledged expression. Even so, many people are particular in this regard [and read <em>Zachor</em>
            several different ways]. In our community, we first read <em>Parashat Zachor</em> according to the accepted pronunciation used throughout the year.
            Then, only after the second blessing is finished, those who want to read it with different pronunciations come forth and do so. By allowing the
            variant readings only after the blessing, we show that everyone has already fulfilled their obligations with the regular one.

            One must remember Amalek verbally. After all, <em>Chazal</em> understand the prohibition against forgetting what Amalek did to us as a [passive]
            commandment, to remember in one’s heart (<em>Megillah</em> 18a). Therefore, when the Torah commands us to remember, it means through verbalization.
            The <em>poskim</em> dispute what exactly the biblical obligation entails. The Rambam and Ramban imply that reading from a Torah scroll is a
            rabbinic enactment, and that according to Torah law one can fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> by reading from a <em>Chumash</em> or by any other means
            of remembering. (The Marcheshet [1:22] writes, based on the Ramban at the end of <em>Ki Teitzei</em>, that reading the <em>Megillah</em> on Purim
            also fulfills the <em>mitzvah</em> of remembering Amalek.) On the other hand, according to Tosafot, the Rashba (<em>Berachot</em> 13a), the Rosh,
            and the Eshkol, one is biblically obligated to hear <em>Parashat Zachor</em> from a Torah scroll. The Shulchan Aruch (<em>O.C.</em> 146:3) rules in
            accordance with this opinion. (See <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em>, Frank, <em>Purim</em> 5; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 2:6.) Therefore, we bring a Torah
scroll to a sick person or a prison inmate in order to read <em>Parashat Zachor</em> for him, which we do not do for any other reading (            <em>M.B.</em> 135:46; see also <em>B.H.</em> ibid.).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
If the scroll from which <em>Zachor</em> was read is later found to be invalid, one need not reread the <em>parashah</em> from a different scroll (            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 18:4). After all, several <em>poskim</em> hold that one fulfills the <em>mitzvah</em> without a Torah scroll, and others
            assert that even though it is necessary to read <em>Zachor</em> from a Torah scroll, an invalid one is sufficient. It seems to me that if the
            mistake is found on that very <em>Shabbat</em>, the congregation should reread <em>Parashat Zachor</em>, since <em>Chazal</em> instituted the
            reading on that particular day (see <em>Pri Megadim, Mishbatzot Zahav</em> 143:1; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> p. 36).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
The author of <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> (108) derives from the words of the Rosh that, according to Torah Law, the <em>mitzvah</em> of            <em>Zachor</em> must be performed by reading the <em>parashah</em> from a Torah scroll in the presence of ten [men]. Several <em>Acharonim</em>
            explain the reason as follows: remembering what the Amalekites did to us is supposed to arouse us to wage war against them, and since war is a
            communal obligation, <em>Zachor</em> must be read in public (<em>Keren Orah</em>, <em>Maharam Schick</em>). It seems to me that even the Terumat
            HaDeshen agrees that in the absence of a congregation there is [still] a <em>mitzvah</em> to read it individually. The Sha’ar HaTziyun (685:5) is
            puzzled by the Terumat HaDeshen’s viewpoint and believes that all the other <em>Rishonim</em> hold that a <em>minyan</em> is required only
            rabbinically (see <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 2:9). Practically speaking, if someone finds himself in a place where there is no <em>minyan</em>, he
            should read <em>Zachor</em> privately from a Torah scroll; and if no scroll is available, he should read it from a <em>Chumash</em>, for we already
            learned that some <em>poskim</em> hold that one fulfills the biblical obligation even without a Torah scroll (see <em>Responsa Binyan Shlomo</em>
            54, <em>K.H.C.</em> 685:35).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to the Magen Avraham, one who fails to hear <em>Parashat Zachor</em> on <em>Shabbat</em> can, <em>be’di’avad</em> (ex post facto),
discharge his obligation by hearing the Torah reading on Purim, [starting with the words] <em>Amalek came </em>[<em>and fought with Israel</em> (            <em>Shemot</em> 17:8-16)]. The Mishnah Berurah (685:16) questions this, because [that section] only recounts the narrative of the war against
            Amalek, not the commandment to remember and eradicate him. Some authorities suggest that [he should wait until later in the year] when the
            congregation reads <em>Parashat Ki Teitzei</em>, at the end of which <em>Parashat Zachor</em> is written, and ask the reader to have in mind to
absolve him of his obligation to remember Amalek. Both the reader and listener must have intention to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> (            <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em>, Frank, Purim 6). In my humble opinion, however, it is best for him to read <em>Parashat Zachor</em> privately, from a
            Torah scroll, as soon as possible, in case he might forget it altogether. This way, he will fulfill his obligation according to the vast majority
of <em>poskim</em>. Then, if he remembers, he can act scrupulously and try to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> through the readings of Purim and            <em>Ki Teitzei</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The <em>Acharonim</em> dispute the reason for this <em>mitzvah</em>. According to <em>Keren Orah</em>, it is an impetus to destroy Amalek.
            Therefore, once he is wiped out, the <em>mitzvah</em> ceases to exist. The author of <em>Melechet Shlomo</em> holds that the <em>mitzvah</em> to
            remember Amalek will remain in effect even after that nation is destroyed, because of the fundamentals of belief that it contains. (See the
            Talmudic Encyclopedia under <em>Zechirat Ma’aseh Amalek</em>, notes 33-34.)

            The <em>Rishonim</em> dispute whether or not <em>mitzvot</em> require intent. The Shulchan Aruch (<em>O.C.</em> 60:4) rules that they do require
            intent. After the fact (<em>be’di’avad</em>), one discharges his obligation even if he did not have explicit intent, as long as he knows that the
            reading of <em>Zachor</em> is designed to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of remembering Amalek, for that is [considered] latent intent. One who has
            no idea why we read <em>Zachor</em>, however, does not discharge his obligation [by simply hearing the <em>parashah</em>], according to those who
            require intent (<em>Chayei Adam</em>, <em>M.B.</em> 60:10). One who fails to hear all the words fulfills the <em>mitzvah</em> nonetheless, as long
            as he hears the main point – to remember what Amalek did to us (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 18:1).

            <em>Zachor</em>
            is not considered a time-bound <em>mitzvah</em> because one can fulfill it by remembering Amalek once, and according to the Torah there is no set
            time for its performance. However, many <em>poskim</em> hold that women are exempt because they do not go out to war (<em>Sefer HaChinuch</em>
            603). One opinion holds that the Torah does not require a yearly reading of <em>Zachor</em>; rather, one can fulfill the commandment biblically
through any form of remembrance, once every few years. The author of <em>Torat Chesed</em> (37) writes that according to this opinion,            <em>Parashat Zachor</em> is only a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em>, incumbent on men alone. The Avnei Neizer (<em>O.C.</em> 509) and Marcheshet (1:22)
            also hold that women are exempt. Some authorities maintain that women are obligated [in this <em>mitzvah</em>], because even women must take part
            in a <em>milchemet mitzvah</em> – religious war (<em>Minchat Chinuch</em>). The Ridvaz (on the Rambam, <em>Hilchot Melachim</em> 7:4) explains that
            they are required to supply [the soldiers] with food and water. <em>Responsa Binyan Tzion</em> (2:8) adds that something positive will [surely]
result from women remembering Amalek, just like Yael killed Sisra, Esther put Haman to death, and Yehudit killed the Greek officer. See            <em>Halichot Beitah</em> 9:5-6, with note 8; <em>Yabia Omer</em> 8:54.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Therefore, the best practice is for women to hear <em>Parashat Zachor</em> in a <em>minyan</em>. If that is impossible, someone should read it for
            them from a scroll, without a <em>minyan</em>. If that, too, is unfeasible, they should read it to themselves from a <em>Chumash</em>. Actually,
            some <em>Acharonim</em> write that we do not take out a Torah scroll for the sake of women. This can be found in <em>Responsa Kinyan Torah</em>
            7:53 and <em>Halichot Beitah</em> 9:8. However, I do not understand what the problem is; according to the letter of the law, one may take out a
            Torah scroll in order to learn from it. Many communities, therefore, have a custom to take out a Torah and read <em>Zachor</em> just for women, as
            is cited in <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 9:68 and <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 2:13.

            The Rambam holds that it is permissible to accept converts from Amalek. According to him, the <em>halachah</em> does not follow R. Eliezer’s
opinion in the <em>Mechilta</em>, end of <em>BeShalach</em>, because another opinion is cited there, that of R. Elazar HaModa’i. In addition, the            <em>Gemara</em> about Haman’s descendants goes against R. Eliezer’s viewpoint. The Chida (<em>Ya’ir Ozen</em>, <em>Gimmel</em>,1) writes in a
            similar vein. The Chazon Ish (<em>Y.D.</em> 157:5) explains that R. Eliezer prohibits the conversion of an Amalekite only during war time.
            According to the Avnei Neizer (<em>O.C.</em> 508), we may grant an Amalekite the status of <em>ger toshav</em> [lit., “resident proselyte” – a
            non-Jew who adopts the seven Noachide laws and is thus allowed to live in our Land], who is subservient to the Jews, but he may not become a
            regular convert.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Others prohibit the conversion of Amalekites, interpreting the statement that Haman’s descendants taught Torah in B’nei Brak in various ways: Some
            say that we determine the status of a non-Jew based on his father’s nationality, and these teachers descended from Haman via a daughter (Mahari
            Engel, <em>Gilyonei HaShas</em>, <em>Gittin</em> 57b; Maharsham 3:272). Others explain that we do not accept them at first, but if they are
            accepted by accident, their conversion is valid (<em>Yeshu’ot Malko</em>. <em>Likutim</em> 15). Another authority claims that the conversion is
            valid only if the mistake is discovered several generations later, but if one’s Amalekite origin is revealed immediately, the conversion is null
            and void (<em>Shevut Yehudah</em> on the <em>Mechilta</em>). Another explanation states that the teachers descended from an Amalekite who
            assimilated into another nation and converted afterwards. In such a case, it is impossible to know that he is from Amalek, and we accept him. Later
            on, it was revealed, through <em>Ruach HaKodesh</em> (Divine Inspiration), that these teachers were descendants of Haman, and their conversion was
            valid (R. Chayim Palagi, <em>Einei Kol Chai</em>, <em>Sanhedrin</em> 96b). It is possible to say that an Amalekite can divest himself of the status
of Amalek by accepting the seven Noachide laws, and then, at a later stage, convert (suggested by the Chida, <em>Petach Einayim</em>,            <em>Sanhedrin</em> 96b). According to the author of <em>Kol Mevaser</em> (2:42), it is permissible to convert an Amalekite; the <em>Mechilta</em>
            only prohibits [such a convert] from marrying into the Jewish people. See also <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:71; <em>Chazon Ovadyah</em> on Purim, pp.
            11-15.

            The <em>Rishonim</em> ask, how could the Rabbis establish a fast day on the eve of Purim? <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em> states explicitly that we do
            not fast or deliver eulogies on the day before a Rabbinic holiday. The authors of <em>Tosafot</em> answer that since <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em> was
            repealed, the law regarding the day before [the holidays mentioned therein] was also repealed. Rabbeinu Zerachyah HaLevi explains that Purim has
            the status of a Torah-based holiday, which needs no reinforcement, and one may fast before it. The Rosh and the Ran point out that [this fast] is
            alluded to in <em>Megillat Esther</em> (9:31) – <em>The matter of the fasts and their outcry</em> – therefore, one may fast prior to the holiday.
            The Beit Yosef elaborates on this in section 686.

            Since the Fast of Esther is based on custom, we are more lenient in cases of doubt. Thus, a woman is exempt from fasting for twenty-four months
            after giving birth. Even though the <em>poskim</em> dispute this law when it comes to the other minor fasts – the majority taking a more stringent
            approach, as explained above 7.8 – there is room to rule leniently regarding the Fast of Esther.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
A bride and groom during the seven-day period of joy after their wedding, as well as the “masters” of a <em>brit milah</em> (the father,<em>mohel</em>, and <em>sandek</em>), must observe the other minor fasts but are exempt from fasting on Ta’anit Esther. This is stated in            <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 686:16, <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 686:16, 28, and <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> 2:78. (According to the Gra, they are exempt from
            all the minor fasts.) The Rama, 686:2, maintains that the “masters” of a <em>brit</em> must fast [on Ta’anit Esther], and many conduct themselves
in this manner. With regard to a bride and groom, however, the custom is to be lenient; see <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em>, by Harari, 3:7, and            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 686:4.
        </p>

            The Rama (686:2) writes that those who have very painful eye-aches need not fast [on Ta’anit Esther], but they should make up the fast a different
            day. Most <em>Acharonim</em> explain his intention as follows: even though they are not considered [truly] sick, they may postpone their fast to a
            different day, since they are in pain. This is not the case regarding the other minor fasts, on which people must fast even if they are in pain. In
practice, it is difficult to distinguish between one who is sick and one who is [merely] in pain. Likewise, R. Harari writes in his            <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> (chap. 3, n. 25), quoting R. Shaul Yisraeli and R. Mordechai Eliyahu, that those who suffer from eye-aches need not fast
            [on Ta’anit Esther], just like a sick person, and they need not compensate for the missed fast. On the minor fasts, it is proper to act stringently
            and refrain from washing oneself and playing music, as a sign of mourning over the Temple’s destruction (see above 7.2, n. 3). On the Fast of
            Esther, however, there is no reason to adopt this stringency.
