    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Shabbat <em>Amida</em> is comprised of seven <em>berakhot</em>. The
        first three and last three <em>berakhot</em> are identical to the
        corresponding <em>berakhot </em>in weekday <em>Amida</em>; however,
instead of the thirteen middle <em>berakhot</em>, on Shabbat a special        <em>berakha</em> about the sanctity of the Shabbat is recited.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Although it would have been possible to recite all the weekday        <em>berakhot</em> of the <em>Amida</em> on Shabbat in addition to a
        special <em>berakha</em> in honor of the day, the Sages did not want to
trouble people with lengthy prayer, so they shortened the        <em>Amida</em> by replacing the middle thirteen <em>berakhot</em> with
        just one <em>berakha</em>. However, if one mistakenly began to recite
        the weekday <em>berakhot</em> and realizes in the middle of one of the
        blessings that it is Shabbat, she concludes that <em>berakha</em> and
        only then returns to the Shabbat liturgy; since in principal it would
        be acceptable to recite the weekday <em>berakhot</em>, once she already
        began reciting the <em>berakha</em>, it is proper that she finishes it
        (SA<em> </em>268:2).

        The Sages instituted a special <em>berakha</em> for each <em>Amida</em>
of Shabbat: <em>Atta Kidashta</em> for <em>Ma’ariv</em>,<em>Yismaĥ Moshe</em> for <em>Shaĥarit</em>, and <em>Atta Eĥad</em> for        <em>Minĥa</em>. One who accidentally mixes up one <em>berakha </em>with
another, for example by reciting the <em>Minĥa</em> liturgy at        <em> Ma’ariv</em>, still fulfills her obligation, because they all
        address the sanctity of Shabbat. However, if he mistakenly prays a
        weekday <em>Amida</em> instead of the Shabbat <em>Amida</em>, since she
        does not mention Shabbat, she does not fulfill her obligation and must
pray again. If she realizes her error before finishing the        <em>Amida</em>, she returns to the Shabbat <em>berakha </em>and
        continues from there to the end of the <em>Amida</em> (SA 268:5-6).

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Over 400 years ago, the kabbalists of Tzefat began accepting Shabbat by
        reciting psalms and liturgical poems. Because the Jewish people wished
        to give expression to the <em>neshama yeteira </em>(the extra soul that
        one receives when observing Shabbat), this custom was accepted by all
        Israel and became <em>Kabbalat </em>Shabbat. At that time lived R.
        Shlomo Alkabetz, who composed the wonderful poem <em>Lekha Dodi </em>
        that is used to welcome the Shabbat in all synagogues.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It was Arizal’s custom to welcome the Shabbat in a field, facing west
toward the setting sun (the Sages say [BB 25a] that the        <em>Shekhina</em> is manifest primarily in the west). This custom was
accepted in most synagogues; when reciting the last stanza of        <em>Lekha Dodi</em>, in which Shabbat is welcomed like a bride, the
        congregation faces west. Accordingly, even when the entrance to the
        synagogue faced a different direction, the congregation faces west.
        Some have the custom to face the entrance to the synagogue, even if it
        is not to the west, as an expression of the idea that Shabbat is a
        guest that enters through the door (some Sephardic communities face
west throughout the recitation of <em>Mizmor Le-David </em>and        <em>Lekha Dodi</em>).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In many synagogues, Friday night services begin relatively late, and
        the congregation reaches <em>Lekha Dodi</em> after sunset. In order to
        fulfill the mitzva of <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> (adding on to Shabbat),
they must accept Shabbat before sunset by saying "<em>Bo’i kalla</em>        <em>Shabbat ha-malka</em>" ("Come, o bride, o Shabbat queen"). Thus, it
        is best if after <em>Minĥa</em>, before sunset, the <em>gabbai</em>
        makes this declaration.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Women generally accept Shabbat at candle lighting, thereby fulfilling        <em>tosefet Shabbat </em>in an outstanding manner. A woman who
regularly prays <em>Minĥa</em> should make every effort to pray        <em>Minĥa</em> on Friday before candle lighting, for in the opinion of
        many <em>poskim</em>, after she accepts Shabbat by lighting the
candles, she is unable to pray a weekday <em>Minĥa</em> (MB 263:43).        <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if she did pray <em>Minĥa</em> before she lit the
candles, she may rely on the lenient opinion. The lenient        <em>poskim</em> maintain that even though she accepted Shabbat and is
        forbidden from doing <em>melakha</em> (labors forbidden on Shabbat),
still, she may still pray a weekday <em>Amida</em> (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:42; also see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em>, ch. 2 n. 6).

            3. <em>Va-yekhulu </em>and<em> Magen Avot</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In the <em>Amida</em> on Shabbat night we recite<em> Va-yekhulu</em>,
        the three verses at the end of account of creation (Bereishit 2:1-3)
        that introduce the idea of Shabbat. The Sages teach (<em>Shabbat </em>
        119b) that one who recites <em>Va-yekhulu</em> in the Shabbat evening
        prayers becomes like a partner with God in creation. God purposely
        created the world incomplete so that we could become His partners in
        its repair. Our partnership begins with belief in the Creator, and from
        there we work to rectify the world and express His glory.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages further teach that one who recites <em>Va-yekhulu</em> in the
        Shabbat evening prayers is escorted home by two angels, who place their
        hands on his head and say: "Your iniquity will be removed and your sin
will be atoned." The idea of Shabbat is linked to repentance (        <em>teshuva</em>), as attested by their phonetic similarity. Indeed, on
        Shabbat we are reminded of our faith in the Creator, and from that
        conviction we return ("<em>shavim</em>")<em> </em>to all the good
        aspirations in our souls. One who recites <em>Va-yekhulu</em> on
        Shabbat eve expresses the profound significance of Shabbat and earns
        the opportunity for true repentance and atonement for his
        transgressions.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In the synagogue, the congregation recites <em>Va-yekhulu</em> again
after the <em>Amida</em>. Some say that the public recitation of        <em> Va-yekhulu</em> serves as testimony to the creation of the world
        (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em> 4:3). We say <em>Va-yekhulu</em>
        a third time in <em>kiddush</em>; often, important prayers are recited
        three times (as in <em>Ashrei</em> and <em>Kedusha</em>).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The Sages instituted that the <em>ĥazan</em> recites        <em>Magen Avot </em>or the <em>Berakha Me’ein Sheva</em> (a summary of
the seven <em>berakhot </em>of the Friday night <em>Amida</em>) after<em>Ma’ariv</em>, to serve as a sort of <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em> (see<em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em> 4:2 for further study). This        <em>berakha</em> is recited by the <em>ĥazan</em>, so after the
congregation sings its opening passage <em>Magen Avot</em>, the        <em>ĥazan</em> must repeat it by himself (MB 268:22).

        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
Since the time of the Rishonim it has been customary to add psalms to        <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> on Shabbat morning<em>.</em> The added psalms
        have either creation or the giving of the Torah as their theme, for
        Shabbat commemorates the creation of the world and the Torah was given
        on Shabbat. Before <em>Yishtabaĥ</em>, we add <em>Nishmat Kol Ĥai</em>
        – a prayer of wondrous praise that mentions the Exodus and thus links
to Shabbat, which commemorates the Exodus (<em>Tur </em>§281;        <em>Levush</em>; see <em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em> 4:4).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
After <em>Shaĥarit</em> we read from the Torah and recite a        <em>haftara </em>from the works of the Prophets. We already learned
about Torah reading (20:15), and, as noted, on Shabbat there are seven        <em>aliyot</em>. Here we will add that the purpose of the reading on
        Shabbat is to complete the entire Torah. During the time of the Talmud,
        it was customary in Eretz Yisrael to complete the Torah every three
        years while in Babylonia it was customary to complete the Torah
        annually, as is the custom today. If on one Shabbat the Torah portion
        was not read, two portions are read on the following Shabbat so as to
        make up for the missed portion (SA<em> </em>135:2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Following the reading of the Torah and the <em>haftara</em>,        <em>Musaf</em> is recited. It corresponds to the additional offerings
        that we were commanded to bring to sanctify Shabbat. We similarly
        recite <em>Musaf</em> on every holiday that we are commanded to
        sanctify through additional offerings (see below, section 6).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175341">5. <em>Haftara</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages ordained that in addition to the Torah reading, we read
passages from the Prophets (the <em>Nevi’im</em>; the second part of<em>Tanakh</em>) that are related to the weekly Torah portion; one        <em>berakha </em>is recited before the <em>haftara </em>and four
        blessings after.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        This reading was instituted as a result of a decree. Once, during
        Second Temple era, there was a decree forbidding Jews from occupying
        themselves with Torah. Since they could not read from the Torah on
        Shabbat, the Sages ordained that a passage from the Prophets be read in
        the same way the Torah is read; they called up seven <em>olim </em>and
        recited <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. After the decree was abolished and
        they went back to reading the Torah every Shabbat, the Sages ordained
        that we continue reading passages from the Prophets. This reading is
        called the "<em>haftara,</em>" as it concludes ("<em>maftir</em>") the
        Torah reading. They even ordained special <em>berakhot </em>for reading
        from the Prophets. Since at the time of the decree seven people were
        called to read from the Prophets, and each one read at least three
        verses, the <em>haftara </em>must contain at least 21 verses. However,
        if a section comes to a close before 21 verses are read, it is
        permissible to read fewer verses (SA<em> </em>284:1, MB 2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        So that the <em>haftara</em> does not seem equal to the Torah in
importance, the Sages ordained that the person reading the        <em>haftara</em> ("the <em>maftir</em>")<em> </em>is first called up to
        the Torah. This <em>aliya </em>is therefore called "<em>maftir</em>,"
        and its purpose is to make it clear that reading from the Prophets
        alone is not as important as reading from the Torah. Rather, only after
        reading from the Torah can one continue an read from the Prophets.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some say that the <em>haftara </em>must be read from a parchment scroll
        of the Prophets,just like the Torah (<em>Levush</em>). However, many
Aĥaronim write that it is permissible to read it from a printed book.        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, it is best to read the <em>haftara</em> from a
book that contains that entire work of the Prophets, though        <em>be-di’avad</em> it is also permissible to read it from a printed
        book in which only the verses of the <em>haftara</em> are printed, like
        they appear in the <em>Ĥumashim</em> nowadays (MB 284:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The person called up for <em>maftir</em> must be the sole person
        reading from the Prophets, and the congregation shall hear his reading.
        One who wishes to read along quietly may do so, as long as he does not
        distract neighbors from hearing the reader (MB 284:11; BHL).

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As we learned (above, 2:2-5), <em>le-khatĥila </em>women should pray
        the <em>Amida</em> of <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> every day
        (including Shabbat, when they recite the Shabbat <em>Amida</em>). Even
        if they pray one <em>Amida</em> daily, they still fulfill their
        obligation, and it is best if the one prayer is <em>Shaĥarit</em>. In
        extenuating circumstances, they may rely on those who maintain that
women fulfill their obligation with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Women who are busy raising children may rely
        on this opinion <em>le-khatĥila</em>. However, it is proper that even
those women who act leniently on weekdays by only saying<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> recite the        <em>Amida</em> of <em>Shaĥarit</em> on Shabbat, because on Shabbat
        there is usually more free time. Many women even enhance the mitzva by
        walking to the synagogue to pray with the congregation on Friday night
        and Shabbat morning.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Regarding Torah reading, we learned above (2:10) that according to        <em>Magen Avraham</em> (283:6) women must hear Torah reading on Shabbat
        morning because women too must hear the whole Torah over the course of
        the year. However, according to the vast majority of <em>poskim</em>,
        women are exempt from hearing Torah reading on Shabbat because it is a
        time-bound mitzva. <em>Halakha </em>follows this opinion. Still, it is
        preferable for women who wish to enhance the mitzva to hear Torah
        reading on Shabbat since all agree that although women are exempt, if
        one does hear it she indeed fulfills a mitzva for which she receives
credit (see above, ch. 2 n. 13; whether or not women must hear        <em>Parashat</em> <em>Zakhor</em> is addressed below, 23:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Concerning <em>Musaf</em>, we learned (2:9) that some <em>poskim</em>
        maintain that women must pray <em>Musaf</em> (<em>Magen Giborim</em>)
        and some say they need not (<em>Tzelaĥ</em>). In practice, since it is
        a rabbinic mitzva, <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient opinion, and
        there is no obligation for women to pray <em>Musaf</em>, although those
        who do are credited for it.

7. Should a Woman Skip Passages in Order to Recite the            <em>Amida</em> with a <em>Minyan</em>?
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is commonly asked: What should a woman do when she arrives at the
synagogue on Shabbat morning and the congregation is about to start the        <em>Amida</em>? For men there are detailed <em>halakhot</em> that
        govern this situation. On one hand, the primary purpose of praying with
        a <em>minyan</em> is to recite the <em>Amida</em> with the
        congregation, and one skips <em>Pesukei De-zimra </em>to do so. On the
other hand, men may not skip <em>Birkhot</em> <em>Keri’at</em><em>Shema</em> so that they adjoin redemption to prayer (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 14:5 n. 8; 25:4). In contrast, women
        are not obligated to recite <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> and hence
        need not adjoin redemption to prayer. On the other hand, they are not
        obligated to pray with a <em>minyan</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The answer is that technically every woman may decide for herself how
to practice. If she wishes, she may pray the entire service, from<em>Pesukei De-zimra </em>to <em>Keri’at Shema </em>and its        <em>berakhot </em>to the <em>Amida</em>. And if she wishes, she may
        pray the <em>Amida </em>right away with the congregation. This is
because women are exempt from <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and<em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> as well as from praying with a        <em>minyan</em> with the congregation. As a result, there are two
        values in play, and each woman may choose which value she prefers. Most
        important is <em>kavana</em>; whatever she thinks will allow her to
        have more <em>kavana </em>is what she should do.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
However, if a woman asks, it is best to recommend that she skip        <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> in order
        to pray the <em>Amida</em> with the <em>minyan</em>. Since a woman’s
        primary obligation is to pray the <em>Amida </em>only, it is preferable
that she prays the <em>Amida</em> in the best possible way, with a        <em>minyan</em>. She will also then have the opportunity to answer
        "amen" and respond to the <em>Kedusha</em> in <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>
and to hear the Torah reading. She should still make sure to recite<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> before the<em>Amida</em>, and if she has more time she should also say        <em>Shema</em> and <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> so that she fulfills the
        mitzva to remember the Exodus and adjoins redemption to prayer.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Two <em>mitzvot </em>from the Torah constitute Shabbat: the positive
mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em> ("commemorate") and the negative mitzva of        <em>Shamor</em> ("observe"). <em>Shamor</em> entails refraining from
        all <em>melakha</em> (creative labor), whereas <em>Zakhor</em> means
        remembering the fundamentals of faith. The first principle we remember
        on Shabbat is the creation of the world, and the second is the Exodus.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Although <em>Zakhor</em> is a positive time-bound mitzva, women are
obligated in its fulfillment just as men are since <em>Zakhor</em> and        <em>Shamor </em>were uttered together in the Ten Commandments and have
        equal status. Therefore, just as women are obligated in the negative
        mitzva of <em>Shamor</em>, so too they are obligated in <em>Zakhor</em>
. Since men and women have an equal obligation, a woman can make        <em>kiddush </em>(a fulfillment of <em>Zakhor</em>)<em> </em>on a man’s
        behalf. Yet a minor cannot make <em>kiddush </em>on an adult’s behalf,
        since minors capable of grasping the idea of Shabbat are only
        rabbinically obligated in <em>kiddush</em>, whereas adults have a Torah
        obligation (SA<em> </em>271:2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages ordained fulfilling the mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em> by saying
the Friday night <em>kiddush</em> over a cup of wine. There are two        <em>berakhot</em> in the nighttime <em>kiddush</em>: <em>Ha-gafen </em>
        on the wine and <em>Mekadesh Ha-Shabbat </em>on the sanctity of
        Shabbat. The recitation of <em>kiddush</em> over wine immediately
        before the meal teaches that the sanctity of Shabbat is expressed on
        all levels – not just the spiritual aspects of life, but even the
        material aspects. It is therefore recited over wine, which brings joy,
        and before a festive meal.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages further ordained that <em>kiddush</em> be recited over wine
        during the day, just before the morning meal. By beginning the meal
        with <em>kiddush</em>, it is apparent that this meal is significant and
        special, and it reminds us of the holiness of Shabbat. Since the basis
        of the obligation of the daytime <em>kiddush</em> is rabbinic, no
special <em>berakha</em> was instituted in honor of Shabbat; only        <em>Ha-gafen </em>is recited, though verses relating to Shabbat are
        customarily recited beforehand. The Shabbat-day <em>kiddush </em>is
        called "<em>Kidusha Rabba</em>" (the "great <em>kiddush</em>")
        euphemistically, as the nighttime <em>kiddush</em> is more important
        (see <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Shabbat</em> 5:1-3 for more on these
        laws).

    <p dir="LTR">
Like men, women are obligated to eat three meals on Shabbat and to have        <em>leĥem mishneh</em> (SA 291:6l; MB<em> </em>and BHL <em>ad loc</em>

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        When the time for <em>Zakhor</em> – fulfilled through <em>kiddush </em>
        – arrives, it is a mitzva to fulfill it with alacrity. So that this
        mitzva is not neglected, the Sages prohibited eating or drinking, even
        just water, before <em>kiddush</em>. However, one may wash out one’s
        mouth or swallow medication with water (SA 271:4; MB<em> </em>13; SSK
        52:3).
    </p>

        On Friday night, this prohibition applies the moment Shabbat begins.

        who does not light candles must accept <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> by
        saying "<em>Bo’i kalla Shabbat Ha-malka</em>," and from that point on
        she may not eat or drink until <em>kiddush</em>. Likewise, a man who
        accepted <em>tosefet Shabbat</em> may not eat or drink until he
fulfills the mitzva of <em>kiddush</em> (MB 271:11; See        <em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em> 5:9).

            10. Eating and Drinking Before <em>Kiddush</em> on Shabbat Morning
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On Shabbat day, the prohibition to eat and drink begins at the time
        when it would be proper to recite <em>kiddush</em>. A woman who does
        not generally pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> on Shabbat (see above, 2:2-5) may
not eat or drink from when she wakes up until she recites        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and fulfills
        the obligation to recite <em>kiddush</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        For a woman who normally prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> on Shabbat, the time
        to recite <em>kiddush </em>begins after she prays <em>Shaĥarit</em>;
        from the time finishes <em>Shaĥarit</em>, she may not eat or drink
        until she fulfills the obligation of <em>kiddush</em>. Before praying,
        too, she may not eat or drink; although the prohibition on eating or
        drinking before the daytime <em>kiddush</em> does not yet apply, the
        prohibition on eating or drinking before prayer applies, as one must
        not put her needs before God’s honor. Nevertheless, she may drink water
        or take medicine, since drinking them is need-based and not an
        expression of arrogance.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        A woman who knows that her mind will remain unsettled unless she drinks
        coffee or tea may drink them before praying, because there is no
        arrogance in drinking them; rather, she drinks out of need, to settle
        her mind and have <em>kavana</em> in her prayer. If possible, it is
        preferable that she drink the coffee or tea without sugar and milk. One
        who is concerned that if she does not eat anything she will be so
        hungry that she will be incapable of having proper <em>kavana</em> may
        eat a bit of cake or fruit before praying.

In extenuating circumstances, a woman who does not know how to make        <em>kiddush</em> but is thirsty and finds it difficult to wait to hear
        her husband say <em>kiddush</em> may recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
        and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and drink before <em>kiddush</em>. If she
        becomes hungry, she may eat as well in extenuating circumstances. This
is because there is an opinion that nowadays women are exempt from        <em>kiddush</em> (Maharam Ĥalawa), and in extenuating circumstances one
        may rely on this opinion.

        A married woman whose husband prayed early in the morning and returned

        she intends to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> afterward, because a healthy and
        halakhic family framework dictates that a woman eats with her husband.
        Nonetheless, she should take care to recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar </em>
        and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> beforehand (see above, n. 3, regarding

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are obligated in the mitzva of <em>Havdala</em> just as men. Even
though it is a positive time-bound mitzva, according to most<em>poskim</em>, <em>Havdala</em> is part of the mitzva of<em>Zakhor</em>, which commands us to mark Shabbat at its arrival with        <em>kiddush</em> and at its departure with <em>Havdala</em>. Even
        according to those who maintain that <em>Havdala</em> is a rabbinic
mitzva, the Sages instituted it for women as well, like        <em>kiddush</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There is an opinion that <em>Havdala</em> is a separate mitzva
        instituted by the Sages and that it is not a part of <em>Zakhor</em>
and therefore, since it is time-bound, women are exempt from it (        <em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em>). Out of consideration for that opinion, it is
        preferable <em>le-khatĥila</em> for a woman to hear <em>Havdala</em>
        recited by a man, for he certainly has the obligation to fulfill the
        mitzva of <em>Havdala</em>. However, if there is no man present who
        must recite <em>Havdala</em>, she recites it for herself, in accordance
        with the opinion of the vast majority of <em>poskim</em>. When she
        recites <em>Havdala</em>, she recites all of its <em>berakhot</em>.

Women are exempt from <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> according to most            <em>poskim</em>, as we learned above, 15:4, and that is the common
            practice. Women are obligated to recite the <em>Amida</em>
            according to the vast majority of <em>poskim</em>, as we learned
above, 2:2-5. The reason for the enactment to recite            <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> is to prepare for the <em>Amida</em>, for
            after introductory praises, the <em>Amida</em> is recited more
            properly, as explained in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 14:1,
            and is therefore more likely to be accepted. However, the Sages say
            that the prayer of one who worships with the congregation is
            certainly accepted (<em>Berakhot</em> 8a); thus, <em>minyan </em>is
            of greater value of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>. When it comes to
men, since the Sages instituted <em>berakhot</em> for            <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, the ruling is that they may not skip
            them, as explained in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 14:5.
However, since women are fully exempt from<em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, it seems that they should pray the            <em>Amida</em> with the <em>minyan</em>. The very fact that a woman
            comes to the synagogue implies that her foremost desire is to
            benefit from praying with a <em>minyan</em>, so it is preferable
that she prays with the congregation. If she wants, she may recite            <em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em> afterwards, but it is not
            necessary to make up <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> (<em>ibid</em>. n.
            9). However, I saw that <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> ch. 5 n. 4 states
that since women do not have a mitzva to pray with a            <em>minyan</em>, she should pray in the correct order.
            Nevertheless, it seems that even though there is no mitzva, there
is still value in praying with a <em>minyan</em>, for the<em>Shekhina</em> dwells within a <em>minyan</em>, and when a            <em>minyan</em> prays it is an auspicious time. Therefore, in my
            humble opinion, it is preferable that she fulfill her obligation in
            the optimal way. R. Naĥum Rabinovitch concurs and adds that even
            concerning men we regret that a prolonged prayer becomes routine
            and is no longer supplication, so it is not proper to instruct
            women to add prayers in which they are not obligated, for there is
reason to be concerned that doing so will impair their<em>kavana</em>; it is better to have less prayer with            <em>kavana</em> than more prayer without. Still, it seems to me
that if she can say <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> before the            <em>Amida</em>, all the better, for we have already learned (above,
            16:3) that even though women are technically exempt from
            remembering the Exodus, some <em>poskim</em> maintain that they
            must remember it, so <em>Emet Ve-yatziv </em>has an advantage over
            the other <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>.

            As we learned above in 2:2-5, in principle women must pray one or
            two <em>Amidot </em>every day; therefore it is proper that every
            woman pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> on weekdays and Shabbat. However, many
            women rely on the minority of <em>poskim</em> who maintain that
            according to Rambam a woman fulfills her obligation to pray by
            reciting<em> Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>,
            and women who are busy taking care of their children adopt this
            practice <em>le-khatĥila</em> because they are exempt from prayer.
            Therefore, there is a distinction between a woman who normally
            prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> on Shabbat and one who usually does not, as
            explained in SSK 52:13. Even if she only prays <em>Shaĥarit</em>
            regularly on Shabbat, she can have in mind not to fulfill the
obligation of prayer through <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, thereby allowing her drink before prayer
            (SSK <em>ad loc.</em> n. 44; see also <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>
            15:25). According to <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OĤ 4:101:2, a married
            woman has a special status: since she dines with her husband, her
            obligation of <em>kiddush</em> follows his. If he did not yet
            finish praying, she may eat and drink, because she did not yet
            become obligated in <em>kiddush</em>. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach
concludes that this matter requires further study (SSK<em>ad loc.</em> n. 46), but in times of need, one may rely on            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            A woman who normally prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> may drink coffee or
            tea before prayer, and if she is so ravenous that she cannot have
            proper <em>kavana</em> in her prayer, she may eat a bit of cake as
            well. However, according to MB as cited in BHL §289, one who eats
before <em>Shaĥarit</em> must recite <em>kiddush</em>.            <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OĤ 2:28 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 289:5
concur. However, <em>Responsa Keren Le-David</em> §84,            <em>Ĥelkat Yaakov</em> 4:32, and other Aĥaronim state that the
            obligation of <em>kiddush</em> only applies after prayer, and that
            is implicit in the words of SA too. Thus, one who may eat before
            prayer should eat without <em>kiddush</em>. This is the prevailing
            practice, as I wrote elsewhere (<em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em>
5:9). Regarding men and eating before prayer, in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 12:7 I was more stringent because
            men have a more strict status, as explained above, ch. 8 nn. 5 and
            6.

According to Maharam Ĥalawa, women are exempt from the daytime            <em>kiddush</em>. Additionally, Raavad and those who follow his
            approach maintain that there is no prohibition to eat before the
            daytime <em>kiddush</em>. Moreover, there are those who explain the
            opinion of Rambam to mean that although it is forbidden to eat and
            drink before <em>kiddush</em>, water is permitted. Therefore, in
            times of need, a woman may drink before <em>kiddush</em>, and in
            extenuating circumstances, she is even permitted to eat, as stated
in <em>Responsa Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 4:28:3; SSL 52:13, and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 289:6.

According to Rambam, <em>She’iltot</em>, <em>Smag</em>,            <em>Sefer Ha-ĥinukh,</em> and most of <em>poskim</em>, the mitzva
            of <em>Havdala</em> is from the Torah, as <em>Zakhor</em> requires
            marking Shabbat at its beginning (through <em>kiddush</em>) and end
(through <em>Havdala</em>). Several Rishonim (Meiri and<em>Nimukei Yosef</em> in the name of Ritva and            <em>Magid Mishneh</em>) understand that even Rosh and the Rishonim
            who hold that <em>Havdala</em> is a rabbinic enactment maintain
            that it was instituted on the model of <em>kiddush</em>, and that
            women are obligated in <em>Havdala </em>just as they are obligated
            in <em>kiddush</em>.<em> </em>Only <em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em> maintains
            that <em>Havdala</em> is a rabbinic mitzva and is completely
            disconnected from <em>Zakhor</em>, and that since it is time-bound,
            women are exempt from it. Rema 296:8 shows concern for this opinion
            and writes that consequently women should not say <em>Havdala</em>
            themselves but should hear a man recite it. However, <em>Baĥ</em>,
MA, and other Aĥaronim state that a woman who wants to recite            <em>Havdala</em> for herself may and it is a mitzva for her to do
so since, according to Rema and many Rishonim, women may recite            <em>berakhot </em>on time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> (above, 2:8).
Therefore, according to Rema, women who wish to say            <em>Havdala</em> may, and even though according to SA women do not
            recite <em>berakhot </em>on time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, in this
            case, because the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that
            women are obligated in the mitzva of <em>Havdala</em> and some even
say that their obligation is from the Torah, they may make<em>Havdala</em> without concern of reciting a            <em>berakha le-vatala</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Still, MB as cited in BHL implies that if a woman makes<em>Havdala</em> she does not recite the blessing over fire ("            <em>borei me’orei ha-esh</em>") because this <em>berakha</em> is
            not part of <em>Havdala</em>. SSK 58:16 states this as well.
However, many Aĥaronim (<em>Igrot Moshe</em> ĤM 2:47:2;            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:27; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:43)
            challenge this notion and maintain that the <em>berakha</em> on the
            candle is part of <em>Havdala</em> and therefore that women who
            recite <em>Havdala</em> recite all four blessings.
