Chapter Eight: Pesah<em> Kashrut</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. <em>Matza Ashira </em>("Egg Matza")
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>hametz</em> that the Torah forbids is comprised of flour and water. If flour was kneaded with fruit juice - even if the dough sits a full day and
rises - it is not considered <em>hametz </em>since rising of this kind is different from the type forbidden by the Torah. The category of "fruit juice" ("    <em>mei peirot</em>") includes wine, honey, milk, oil, and egg, in addition to all juices squeezed from a fruit, like apple or berry juice. Since fruit
    juice does not cause dough to become <em>hametz</em>, one may knead, bake, and eat such dough on Pesah. Nevertheless, one would not fulfill the mitzva of
matza on the first night of Pesah with it, because the Torah calls matza "<em>lehem oni</em>" ("poor man's bread"), and matza made from fruit juice is "    <em>matza ashira</em>"<em> </em>("rich matza" - colloquially known in English as "egg matza"), since it possesses more than the taste of just flour and
    water.
</p>
<p>
    If a drop of water gets mixed in with the fruit juice, it can cause the dough to become <em>hametz</em>. Moreover, according to many <em>poskim</em>, the
    combination of water and fruit juice actually expedites the leavening process. Thus, in order to avoid such doubts, the Sages prohibited kneading dough
    with a mixture of fruit juice and water during Pesah (SA 462:1-3).
</p>
<p>
    The Ashkenazic custom is to avoid eating anything made of dough kneaded with fruit juice out of concern that water mixed with the fruit juice causing the
    dough to become <em>hametz</em>. Furthermore, it takes into account the opinion of Rashi, who disagrees with most Rishonim and maintains that fruit juice
    alone can cause something to become <em>hametz </em>on the rabbinic level. Although in principle it is possible to follow the lenient ruling of the vast
    majority of <em>poskim</em>, Ashkenazic custom, which should not be altered, is nevertheless strict, except in the case of the elderly and ill, where the
    custom is to be lenient (Rema 462:4). Nowadays, many Sephardic <em>poskim</em> also rule stringently, because it is known that water and other ingredients
    are generally added to fruit juice, increasing the likelihood that the egg matza became <em>hametz</em> (R. Mordechai Eliyahu).

2. Becoming <em>Hametz </em>Once It Has Been Baked, and the Status of <em>Matza Sheruya </em>(Soaked Matza; "<em>Gebrokts</em>")
</h2>
<p>
    Once matza has been completely baked, the flour in it loses the capacity to become <em>hametz</em>, even if it is soaked in water for a long time. An
    indication that the matza is fully baked is that a crust has formed on its surface and that it breaks cleanly, with no threads of unbaked dough extending
    from it. Thus, it is permitted to soak matza in soup, and an elderly or sick person who cannot eat dry matza on the Seder night may soften matza by soaking
    it in water (SA 461:4 and below 16:29). Likewise, if the matza was ground into flour, it is permitted to knead it with water; one need not worry about it
    becoming <em>hametz </em>because, as mentioned, once it has been thoroughly baked, it cannot (SA 463:3). Therefore, one may bake cakes from the five
    species of grain during Pesah, or cook various dishes - such as gefilte fish and matza balls - that contain matza meal.
</p>
<p>
    Yet there are some who avoid soaking fully-baked matza in water, lest some of the flour was not kneaded properly and remained unbaked, and soaking the
    matza will cause the unbaked dough to become <em>hametz</em>. They likewise fear that some flour may have stuck to the matza after the baking process, and
    if the matza is soaked in water, this flour will become <em>hametz</em>. There is yet another reason to be strict about matza meal: an unlearned person
    might confuse matza meal with real flour and end up violating the prohibition of <em>hametz</em> on Pesah. Hasidim accept this stringency and refrain from
    eating matza that has been soaked, or "<em>gebrokts."</em>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em>, however, nearly unanimously agree that one need not be stringent, since it can be assumed that the kneading was thorough, leaving no
    flour unkneaded or unbaked. This is the custom of Sephardic and non-Hasidic Ashkenazic Jews. Today, even some Hasidic Jews are lenient because, due to the
    popular practice of baking thin <em>matzot</em>, there is no longer any concern that some of the flour was not properly baked. Likewise, there is no
    concern that flour may have gotten stuck to the matza, since matza bakeries are careful to separate the area where flour is handled from the area where the
    matza comes out of the oven. MB 458:4 states: "Although in principle there is no reason for concern about this, and it is permitted to eat soaked matza,
    one should not mock conscientious people who choose to be stringent."

3. Sephardic and Ashkenazic Approaches to Keeping Kosher on Pesah
</h2>
<p>
    In general, there are two fundamental approaches to <em>kashrut </em>on Pesah. According to most <em>poskim</em>, the laws of <em>hametz</em> on Pesah are
    no different than the laws of all other forbidden foods, with one exception: all other forbidden foods are <em>batel be-shishim </em>(rendered
    insignificant when constituting less than one sixtieth of the volume of a mixture), whereas <em>hametz</em> is not. However, all other laws of mixtures
    apply to <em>hametz</em> on Pesah. Therefore, when there is no halakhic reason to suspect that a food mixture has absorbed the taste of <em>hametz</em>, it
    is kosher for Pesah. Likewise, where an individual <em>posek</em> is stringent and the great majority of <em>poskim</em> are lenient, <em>halakha</em>
    follows the lenient opinion.
</p>
<p>
    However, Ashkenazic Jews are customarily very strict about <em>hametz</em>, often showing concern for a stringent opinion even against the lenient majority
    and practicing caution where general halakhic principles indicate no reason to do so. Nevertheless, Ashkenazic custom also places a limit to its
    stringencies, and <em>poskim</em> are careful not to pile restrictions upon existing restrictions. The general tendency, though, is to show concern for
every uncertainty. The basis for this approach is the Sages' ruling that even a drop of <em>hametz</em> is forbidden; thus, if a mere crumb of    <em>hametz</em> renders its entire mixture forbidden, so too individual halakhic opinions should be taken into account.
</p>
<p>
    This explains the consistent difference between the rulings of <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, which follow general halakhic principles, and those of Rema, which
    account, <em>le-khathila</em>, for the stringent opinions. Nonetheless, in cases of pressing need Rema adopts the lenient approach, since <em>halakha </em>
    fundamentally accords with most <em>poskim</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    In general, Sephardim follow <em>Shulhan Arukh </em>and Ashkenazim follow Rema<em>.</em> However, some Sephardic <em>poskim</em> tend to be stringent, and
    their rulings are accepted in some Sephardic communities.

4. Principles of Kosher Supervision on Pesah
</h2>
<p>
There is a fundamental question regarding the laws of <em>kashrut</em> on Pesah: what is the status of foods that are not normally made with    <em>hametz </em>all year round? Are they kosher for Pesah as they are, without any special supervision, or must we consider the possibility that they were
    somehow mixed with <em>hametz</em> and should not be eaten on Pesah?
</p>
<p>
According to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, as long as there is no real concern that some <em>hametz</em> fell into this food or that it has absorbed the taste of    <em>hametz </em>by being cooked in a pot in which <em>hametz</em> was cooked recently, there is no need to suspect that the food contains <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
However, Rema writes that Ashkenazic custom is preferably to avoid eating specific products without special supervision for Pesah. This is because    <em>hametz</em> is used throughout the year, and we are not generally cautious about it, so we suspect that some of it may have fallen unnoticed into these
    particular foods. We are also concerned that the foods may have been unwittingly cooked in <em>hametz</em> pots.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, all <em>kashrut</em> organizations today tend to follow the stringent ruling of Rema and do not certify foods for Pesah unless due caution to
    avoid <em>hametz </em>was exercised during the food's preparation. Perhaps this is the way one must act today even according to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>,
    because all industrially produced foods contain a variety of ingredients, and there is concern that one of them is not kosher for Pesah. Therefore, during
    Pesah, one must be careful not to eat any factory food products that are not certified kosher for Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    Where the facts of a case are not in doubt, there are still often practical differences between the rulings of <em>Shulhan Arukh </em>and Rema. Although
    fundamentally the law accords with <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, the tendency today is to be stringent so that food will be kosher for all communities. This is
    the appropriate practice when it is not overly difficult to be stringent. However, when stringency causes significant loss, there is room to support those
    who follow <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>.

5. Milk from an Animal That Ate <em>Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
    One issue that the foremost Aharonim dealt with is the status of milk which came from a cow that ate <em>hametz</em>. Clearly the milk itself does not
    contain <em>hametz</em>, for it was digested and completely transformed to the point that it is no longer considered <em>hametz</em> at all. However, the
    cow was able to produce milk by virtue of the <em>hametz</em>, and since it is forbidden to derive benefit from <em>hametz</em>, perhaps it is forbidden to
    benefit from milk produced by the virtue of <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> agree that milk obtained from a cow before the onset of the prohibition of <em>hametz</em> is kosher for Pesah, because one is allowed
    to derive benefit from <em>hametz</em> before Pesah. Just as it is permissible to sell <em>hametz</em> before Pesah and use the money to buy food for
    Pesah, so too it is permissible to feed a cow <em>hametz</em> before Pesah in order to produce milk that will be consumed on Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    The disagreement concerns milk from a gentile's cow that ate <em>hametz</em> after the onset of the prohibition. Some <em>poskim</em> take a lenient
    stance, contending that since the <em>hametz</em> prohibition does not apply to the animal of a gentile, its milk is not considered produced in a forbidden
    manner. Furthermore, <em>hametz</em> alone does not cause milk to be produced. Rather, it must be combined with other foods and processed by the animal's
body. Since the <em>hametz</em> is only one component, it is not prohibited. On the other hand, some <em>poskim</em> rule stringently that as long as<em>hametz</em> is a factor causing the production of the milk, the milk is forbidden. Others say that if twenty-four hours have passed since the cow ate    <em>hametz</em>, the milk is kosher.
</p>
<p>
    If the animal owned by a Jew was fed <em>hametz</em> in violation of <em>halakha</em>,<em> </em>one may not drink its milk, firstly because it is forbidden
    for the animal's owner to derive benefit from <em>hametz</em>, and secondly because one may not assist those who violate the Torah.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    The same applies to eggs and meat.
</p>
<p>
    During Pesah, Tnuva, a major Israeli dairy producer (and perhaps others) only accepts milk from dairy farms that have been made kosher for Pesah and whose
    cows are not fed <em>hametz</em>. In this case, it is unnecessary to be scrupulous and buy milk products before Pesah, because even dairy products
    manufactured on Pesah are completely kosher for the duration of the holiday.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. Meat and Eggs    
</h2>
<p>
    The status of beef and chicken in this regard is the same as that of milk. If the animal was slaughtered before Pesah, there is no halakhic problem, even
    if it had eaten <em>hametz</em>. However, since the stomach may contain undigested leavened barley grains, its contents must be thrown out. If a gentile's
    animal was fed <em>hametz</em> and slaughtered during Pesah, some <em>poskim</em> forbid consuming its meat, while others are lenient. It is proper to be
    stringent and not buy the meat of a Jew's animal that was fed <em>hametz</em> on Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    In actuality, most meat is sold in packages, which thus must be labeled kosher for Pesah. Even if the animal was slaughtered before Pesah, when there is no
    problem if it was fed <em>hametz</em>, supervision is nevertheless required to ensure that no <em>hametz</em> fell into the meat between the slaughtering
    and the packaging.
</p>
<p>
    The same applies to eggs: as long as the eggs were bought before Pesah, they are entirely kosher for Pesah; that the hens were fed <em>hametz </em>makes no
    difference because it was not prohibited when eaten. The halakhic status of an egg that comes from a hen that ate <em>hametz</em> on Pesah depends who the
owner is. If the hen belongs to a gentile, the <em>poskim</em> disagree about the permissibility of the eggs. If the hen belongs to a Jew, even though some    <em>poskim</em> are lenient, it is proper to be stringent and refrain from buying such eggs. In practice, there is no supervision on eggs laid during
    Pesah, so it is best to buy eggs laid before Pesah.
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
    Another problem that has arisen pertains to the markings stamped on each egg. There was some concern that these markings contain <em>hametz</em> and that a
    drop of it might fall into Pesah food. However, I heard from Tnuva's R. Ze'ev Weitman that all eggs brought to market via Israel's Egg Production Council
    (which does not include the black market) are marked before Pesah with a stamp that contains no <em>hametz </em>(the relevant mark is a series of stars).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. Medicines on Pesah
</h2>
<p>
    Medicines are the subject of some of the most common questions on Pesah. There is concern that pills contain wheat-based starch. The purpose of the starch
    is to solidify and harden the pills. Had the starch been produced from potatoes or <em>kitniyot</em>, there would be no problem even for Ashkenazim, as for
    medicinal purposes one may swallow pills containing <em>kitniyot</em>. But what about starch extracted from a type of grain that can become <em>hametz</em>
    ? It must be emphasized that a dangerously ill person whose treatment requires eating <em>hametz</em> has a mitzva to eat <em>hametz</em>. Saving a life
    overrides the prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em>. The question applies to an ill person whose life is not at risk.
</p>
<p>
    The answer depends on the taste of the medicine: if it is flavored, like syrup, lozenges, or chewables, then one must ascertain that it is kosher for
    Pesah. In case of doubt, its use is forbidden. However, if the medicine is bitter or tasteless to the point that it is not fit as food, it may be swallowed
on Pesah. Even if the starch was derived from wheat, since it has been mixed with various bitter substances it is inedible and has lost its status as    <em>hametz</em>. As we have seen, <em>hametz</em> that was rendered unfit for a dog's consumption before Pesah is no longer considered <em>hametz</em> and
    may be kept on Pesah. The fact that one wants to swallow the medicine does not demonstrate that the <em>hametz</em> in the medicine is important to him,
since the medicine, not the <em>hametz</em>,<em> </em>is significant for him, and the <em>hametz </em>itself is bitter and unfit for consumption. The    <em>hametz</em> in it is thus <em>batel</em> and not prohibited (<em>Hazon Ish, </em>Mo'ed 116:8; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OH 2:92).
</p>
<p>
Some meticulously observant people try to avoid even bitter medicines that contain <em>hametz</em>. They show concern for the opinion of the few    <em>poskim</em> who maintain that medicine is not considered unfit for animal consumption since we deem it significant, and it is thus rabbinically
    prohibited. Other <em>poskim</em> permit bitter medicines that contain <em>hametz </em>starch for one who is bedridden or whose entire body is in pain, but
    rule stringently for one suffering from mild aches and pains.
</p>
<p>
    However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that bitter medicines containing <em>hametz</em> may be taken by any ill person, even only to reduce mild pain, as a
    prophylactic, or to fortify the body.
</p>
<p>
    Practically speaking, if one is uncertain whether certain bitter or tasteless medicines contain wheat starch, he may swallow them without ensuring that
    they are free of wheat starch. As we have seen, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that medicines rendered unfit for animal consumption before Pesah may be
    consumed during Pesah even if they are known to contain <em>hametz</em>. Even one who prefers to comply with the stringent opinion on this issue need not
    be strict if he is uncertain whether the medicine contains <em>hametz</em>. This is especially true nowadays, when we know that potato and corn starch are
used more widely than wheat starch. Thus, in practice, one may consume bitter or tasteless medicines on Pesah without ascertaining whether they contain    <em>hametz</em>. When one knows for certain that a particular medicine contains <em>hametz</em> starch, he may choose to rely on the lenient opinion of
    most <em>poskim</em> or the stringent minority.

<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. Citric Acid    
</h2>
<p>
    Citric acid is used to flavor juices, jams, candies, and various food items. In the past it was produced from lemons and other fruit, but nowadays it is
    produced industrially from wheat flour.
</p>
<p>
    Although during the production process the flour is initially mixed with water and may become <em>hametz</em>, at a later stage it loses its taste and
    appearance, is rendered unfit for a dog's consumption, and thus loses its status as <em>hametz.</em> Some <em>poskim </em>therefore permit eating products
    containing citric acid on Pesah (<em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 2:62).
</p>
<p>
    However, many <em>poskim</em> are stringent in this case. In their opinion, <em>hametz</em> only loses its status if it becomes unfit for a dog's
consumption due to spoilage. If it is intentionally rendered inedible so that it may be used to flavor foods, it is not nullified and is considered    <em>hametz</em> for all purposes (<em>Minhat Yitzhak</em> 7:27; <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 1:34; <em>Shevet Ha-Levi</em> 4:47).
</p>
<p>
    Rabbi She'ar Yashuv Cohen, the municipal rabbi of Haifa, investigated and found that there is no concern that citric acid is <em>hametz</em>. To begin
with, the flour that starts the process does not become <em>hametz </em>since it sits in water for only six minutes - not enough time to become    <em>hametz</em>. At this point, the starch is extracted from the mixture, and starch alone cannot become <em>hametz</em>. Moreover, citric acid is not
    produced from the wheat starch itself, but from molds that feed off a substance whose ingredients include a material extracted from the unleavened starch.

</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
9. Soaps and Cosmetics    
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Poskim</em>
    disagree whether body ointments that contain <em>hametz</em> may be used on Pesah. While soaps, shampoos, and creams are not made from <em>hametz</em>,
    they sometimes contain grain alcohol or other <em>hametz</em> derivatives, leading to queries about their status on Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    Some say that applying an ointment is equivalent, by rabbinic enactment, to drinking. Consequently, even if the <em>hametz</em> in these products is not
    fit for a dog's consumption, it retains the status of <em>hametz</em> because it is suitable for anointing, and thus it is forbidden to use them on Pesah.
    Accordingly, one must use soaps, shampoos, and creams that are kosher for Pesah.
</p>
<p>
Others maintain that the Sages only equated the application of ointment to drinking with regard to Yom Kippur and anointing with oil consecrated as<em>teruma </em>(priestly gift). All other Torah prohibitions relate to eating alone, not anointing. Although it is forbidden to derive benefit from<em>hametz</em>, the <em>hametz</em> in these products was rendered unfit for a dog's consumption even before Pesah began and thus lost the status of    <em>hametz</em>. It is therefore permissible to derive benefit from them and apply them to the body during Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    Since this dispute relates to rabbinic law, the <em>halakha</em> accords with the lenient opinion, and meticulously observant individuals act stringently.
</p>
<p>
    Distinctions must be made between four gradations of products containing <em>hametz</em>, of which the middle two are subject to dispute:
</p>
<p>
    1) Toothpastes must be certified kosher for Pesah because they are flavored and thus like any other food product.
</p>
<p>
    2) Creams that are absorbed into the skin, flavorless lipstick, and perfumes that contain alcohol need not be certified kosher for Pesah, in keeping with
    the lenient opinion, since they are not fit for consumption and generally do not contain <em>hametz </em>ingredients. Nonetheless, many choose to be
    stringent and buy creams and perfumes that are certified kosher for Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    3) Soaps and shampoos warrant even more room for leniency because they are designed to clean, not to be absorbed into the skin. Nevertheless, some are
    stringent.
</p>
<p>
    4) Detergents, shoe polish, and the like do not require any kosher certification. Even dishwashing detergents need no certification because their taste is
    foul. Even if these substances were mixed with <em>hametz</em>, its taste was befouled before Pesah and it is no longer considered <em>hametz</em>.

            1. There are two issues here: The first is whether flour mixed with fruit juice can become <em>hametz</em>, and the second is whether, in a case
            where water was added to the dough, one may knead the dough while being careful that it does not become <em>hametz</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first issue is summarized in <em>Birur Halakha</em> on <em>Pesahim</em><em> </em>35a, s.v. "mei peirot ein mahmitzin." According to Rashi and
            those who agree with him, a flour and fruit juice mixture can become <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em> (see above 2:5), which is rabbinically
            forbidden. Conversely, most Rishonim maintain that flour mixed with fruit juice alone never becomes <em>hametz</em>, but if any water got into the
mixture, the mixture can become <em>hametz</em>. There is a dispute about the severity of this <em>hametz</em>:<em> </em>According to Rambam, it is<em>hametz gamur</em>, and according to Rabbeinu Tam it is <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em>. <em>Pri Megadim</em> states that all agree it becomes<em>hametz gamur </em>when the majority of liquid in the mixture is water (BHL<em> </em>462:2 s.v. "memaharim").<em> </em>See the book            <em>Matza Ashira </em>5:7-8.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second issue is explained in <em>Birur Halakha</em> on <em>Pesahim</em> 36a, which cites a tannaitic dispute about <em>matza ashira</em> on
            Pesah. According to Rif<em> </em>and Rambam, the <em>halakha</em> follows Rabbi Akiva that one is permitted to knead flour in a mix of fruit juice
            and water provided that one takes caution to prevent the mixture from becoming <em>hametz</em>, just as one would with a standard flour-water
            mixture. This is also the opinion of R. Natronai Gaon and Me'iri. On the other hand, many Rishonim maintain that one should not knead flour with
fruit juice and water, since it turns into <em>hametz</em> faster than does flour and water. There is a dispute about what to do            <em>be-di'avad</em>. According to R. Hai Gaon and <em>Behag</em>, the <em>halakha</em> follows Rabban Gamliel that one is required to burn the
            kneaded dough. According to Rabbeinu Hananel<em>, </em>Ritz Gi'at<em>, </em>and Rosh, the <em>halakha</em> follows the Sages that if one bakes the
            dough very quickly, he is permitted to eat it. This is the opinion that SA accepts (462:2). The Ashkenazic custom is to be strict out of concern
            for Rashi's opinion that flour and fruit juice alone can become <em>hametz</em>, or out of concern that some water will mix with the fruit juice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameters of what is considered water and what is considered fruit juice are discussed in SA 462:3 and 7 and �466. The entire topic is
            summarized in detail in <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit </em>entry "<em>Hametz</em><em>" </em>pp. 89-99.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the Sephardic custom, R. Mordechai Eliyahu had a long-standing opposition to certifying <em>matza ashira </em>as kosher for Pesah out of
            concern that the fruit juice has been mixed with water or a leavening agent. (There are also grounds to forbid this because it generates activity
that mimics the process of becoming <em>hametz</em>, as explained by Maharam Halawa on <em>Pesahim </em>28a and <em>Matza Ashira </em>p. 178.)            <em> </em>Over time, it became apparent that this concern was justified, and water and occasionally leavening agents are added to fruit juice.
            Nevertheless, some authorities rule leniently; according to them, these leavening agents do not cause the dough to become <em>hametz</em>. This
            ruling appears in <em>Yabi'a Omer</em> 9:42 and <em>Shema Shlomo</em> 4:13-17. However, according to many authorities these leavening agents are
            forbidden by the Torah, or at least rabbinically, and therefore they prohibit Sephardim from eating factory-produced <em>matza ashira</em> on
            Pesah.

            2. <em>Pesahim</em><em> </em>39b states: "These are the things that cannot become <em>hametz</em>: baked items...." Rambam rules accordingly in MT,
            Laws of <em>Hametz </em>and Matza<em> </em>5:5, and this is the consensus of the Rishonim<em>.</em> The sign that something is completely baked is
            that it has a crust on the outside and that it breaks cleanly, with no threads of dough extending (these two standards are identical, as per MB
            461:15 and SHT 23 <em>ad loc</em>.). SAH 463:3 states that a baked item cannot become <em>hametz</em> and one may cook with matza meal. However,
            responsum �6 at the end of SAH<em> </em>states that matza meal is only permissible if one is absolutely certain that all of the flour was fully
            baked, and one should be concerned that perhaps not all of the flour was fully baked or that some flour stuck to the <em>matzot</em> after baking.
            SAH concludes that one should not reprimand the masses who are lenient since they have acceptable authorities on which to rely, but one who is
            stringent is commendable. Regarding matza meal, <em>Knesset Ha-gedola</em> �461 recounts that a woman once saw her neighbor, the rabbi's wife,
            cooking and frying with matza meal and mistakenly assumed that it was permissible to use actual flour on Pesah. When the town's rabbis heard what
            had happened, they banned matza meal because of <em>marit ayin</em> (see <em>Tur</em> �463). <em>Pri Hadash</em> and many other Aharonim disagreed
            with this ban; see also <em>She'elat Yaavetz</em> 2:65 citing the author's father (Hakham Zvi) and <em>Sha'arei Teshuva </em>�460, cited in MB
            458:4. In <em>Ma'aseh Rav</em> �183 it is written that one is permitted to make <em>kufta'ot</em> (dumplings). See <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit </em>
            entry "<em>Hametz</em>" pp. 83-84. <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 461:31 mentions the different opinions of the Aharonim, and concludes: "Where the custom
            is to be lenient, one may be lenient, since there is basis for this opinion, but where there is no custom, one should be stringent." It adds:
            "There is no concern about <em>rekikim</em> ("flatbreads")." Our <em>matzot</em> are "<em>rekikim.</em>" <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 1:21 rules
            leniently <em>le-khathila </em>and states that one who was stringent because he thought that this is the <em>halakha</em> erred and may switch to
            the lenient practice without performing <em>hatarat nedarim</em> (the annulment of vows). However, one who accepted the stringency (without saying
"<em>bli neder</em>") because he wanted to go beyond the letter of the law and now wishes to be lenient should first perform            <em>hatarat nedarim</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, many people of Hasidic descent no longer observe the stringency of <em>gebrokts</em>. This is because contemporary <em>matzot </em>are
            very thin and our ovens are very strong. If one's father was lenient in this matter, one need not perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em>, even if he is
            from a Hasidic family. However, if one's father was stringent and he wants to be lenient, he should perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em> and make sure
            not to insult his father.
        </p>
        <p>
            The details of practicing the stringency of <em>gebrokts</em>:
Those who do not eat <em>gebrokts </em>may be lenient when it comes to children or sick people, since soaking matza is not considered making            <em>hametz</em> on Pesah. Additionally, Jews in the Diaspora who keep <em>gebrokts </em>customarily make matza balls on the eighth day of Pesah to
            show that <em>matza sheruya</em> is not fully prohibited. They prepare the matza balls on <em>Hol Ha-mo'ed </em>but do not otherwise eat off the
            dishes used to prepare the <em>gebrokts</em>. <em>She'arim Metzuyanim Be-halakha</em> 113:7 allows using utensils in which matza was soaked. On the
            other hand, <em>Responsa</em> <em>Kinyan Torah</em> 2:87 states that one may not even soak matza for children or sick people.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as soaking the matza in fruit juice, SAH (<em>op cit</em>.) states that one need not be stringent, and indeed the widespread custom is to
            soak matza in wine and spread various spreads on matza. <em>Kinyan Torah</em> 2:87 is stringent regarding this as well. See the extended discussion
            in <em>Piskei Teshuvot </em>458:5-7.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Sha'arei Teshuva</em>
            460:10 states that even according to those who keep <em>gebrokts </em>one may dip the matza<em> </em>in water and eat it immediately, before it
            could conceivably become <em>hametz</em>. Those who are stringent about dipping matza<em> </em>in fruit juice are stringent about this as well.

3. Here is brief overview of the major disputes between SA and Rema: 1) In 447:4, regarding the dispute among the Rishonim about            <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> (see above 7:4), SA rules that the <em>hametz</em> does not "reawaken," taking the lenient approach in the case of a
            rabbinic law, whereas Rema rules strictly that <em>hametz</em> in a dry mixture "reawakens," though not in a fluid mixture. 2) In 447:5, regarding
            a food that was not guarded for Pesah but there is no indication that it may have become forbidden for Pesah: according to SA it is kosher, and
according to Rema it is not. 3) In 447:10, regarding <em>hametz</em> that is <em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em>: according to SA and most <em>poskim</em>            <em>,</em> it is kosher on Pesah (especially since the uncertainty relates to a rabbinic law), and according to Rema it is prohibited. 4) In 451:6,
            regarding the proper method for koshering utensils: according to SA, we determine the method based on the main use of the utensil, and according to
            Rema<em> </em>we determine the method based on the most severe usage. 5) In 451:11, regarding koshering a frying pan: according to SA, it may be
            koshered in boiling water (<em>hagala</em>), and according to Rema, it is koshered in fire (light <em>libun</em>). 6) In 451:16 and 17, regarding
            koshering <em>hametz</em> pounding and kneading utensils: according to SA, they are koshered via <em>hagala</em>, and according to Rema, they are
            koshered via light <em>libun</em>. 7) In 453:1, the well-known custom of <em>kitniyot</em>. 8) In 462:1, regarding egg matza: according to SA, it
            is kosher, and according to Rema, we are concerned that perhaps a drop of water mixed in with the fruit juice, causing it to become <em>hametz</em>
            . Rema states in 462:4 that we are only lenient in extreme cases, for sick people. 9) In 467:9, regarding whole, uncracked kernels of wheat or
            barley that are found in a cooked dish: according to SA, the dish is permissible, and according to Rema, it is prohibited. 10) In 467:10 and 447:1,
            regarding a cracked kernel of wheat that is found in a cooked dish: according to SA, one may sell the dish to a gentile, excluding the value of the
            wheat kernel, and according to Rema, he must burn the entire dish. 11) The custom of the Hasidim is to prohibit <em>gebrokts</em>.

            4. Some Sephardic <em>poskim </em>are stringent like Rema, as <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> states in 447:86, 88, and 119. Also, <em>Zekhor Le-Avraham</em>
            states at the beginning of the laws of Pesah that the Sephardim have the practice to be stringent like Rema "to the extent that when it comes to
            Pesah, we are Ashkenazim." This is echoed by additional Sephardic <em>poskim</em>. On the other hand, in extenuating circumstances even Rema rules
            to be lenient in accordance with SA (in most cases).

            5. The issue of <em>hozer ve-ne'or </em>lies at the heart of this question. Those who are stringent are concerned that a crumb of <em>hametz</em>
            fell into a food before Pesah, and that when Pesah begins <em>hametz</em> "reawakens" and causes the entire mixture to become forbidden (Rema 447:4
            based on several Ashkenazic Rishonim, and Radbaz 1:487). However, according to the opinion that <em>hametz </em>is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>,
even if a crumb had fallen into the mixture, it would have been <em>batel </em>before Pesah and does not reawaken on Pesah. Moreover,            <em>Pri Hadash</em> states that even according to the opinion that <em>hametz </em>is <em>hozer ve-ne'or </em>there is room to be lenient in this
            case, since there is no reason to suspect that a crumb of <em>hametz</em> fell into the mixture. Furthermore, all agree that the prohibition of
eating a food into which a drop of <em>hametz</em> fell is rabbinic, and according to <em>She'iltot</em>, even <em>hametz </em>is            <em>batel be-shishim</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is another concern that one cooked the food in <em>hametz</em> utensils, and the food absorbed some of the <em>hametz</em> taste from the
            utensils. However, those who are lenient hold that there is no reason to suspect this, since it is assumed that most utensils have not been used
            within twenty-four hours and would then not influence the taste of the dish in a positive way (and would not make the dish prohibited).
            Furthermore, even if the utensils had been used within twenty-four hours of cooking the dish, <em>hametz</em> before Pesah is permissible, thus the
cooked dish is a "<em>nat bar nat"</em> (the pot absorbed the taste of the <em>hametz</em> and in turn, passed the taste on to the cooked dish)            <em> </em>of permissible food, which is permitted; and see <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 1, 11 and in the notes. This fundamental dispute is dependent on
            other issues, including ones that involve sharp foods (<em>davar harif</em>) and their interaction with absorbed tastes; and see MB 447:5.

            6. A cow's milk is the product of two factors: the cow's body and the food it eats. If the cow ate <em>hametz</em>, the status of the milk is
            subject to the tannaitic dispute (AZ 48b) about something that is produced by multiple factors ("<em>zeh ve-zeh gorem</em>"). One disputant forbids
            and the other permits. SA<em> </em>YD 142:11 states that something that is produced by a combination of two factors is permissible. Accordingly,
            the milk of a cow that ate <em>hametz</em> is permissible.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, MA 445:5 (as well as <em>Taz</em>)<em> </em>states that since we are stringent about <em>hametz</em>, maintaining that even a drop renders
a mixture forbidden, it follows that something produced by a combination of two factors is forbidden if one of them is <em>hametz</em>. Most            <em>poskim</em>, including SA<em>, Shakh, </em>and<em> </em>Gra<em>, </em>maintain even in the case of <em>hametz </em>"<em>zeh ve-zeh gorem</em>"
            is permitted. SAH (445:10 and <em>Kuntrus Aharon</em>) concludes that the consensus of most <em>poskim</em> is to be lenient, and one may certainly
            rely on this consensus in a situation of significant loss or an extenuating circumstance. This is also the view recorded in BHL<em> </em>445:2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some, however, argue that regardless of one's position on <em>zeh ve-zeh gorem</em>, milk from a gentile's cow that ate <em>hametz </em>is
            permitted. As explained in <em>Beit Ephraim</em> �35 (cited in <em>Sha'arei Teshuva </em>at the end of �448), since <em>hametz</em> is permissible
for a gentile on Pesah, we do not view the milk from his cow as having been produced by something from which one is forbidden to benefit.            <em>Nishmat Adam</em> �9 permits on different grounds: MA's<em> </em>stringency only applies when the <em>hametz</em><em> </em>is intact, unlike in
            the case of the milk. <em>Responsa Mahari Aszod </em>�127<em> </em>and <em>Responsa Maharam Schick </em>��212 and 222 echo the same idea and state
            that the milk of the gentile's animal that ate <em>hametz</em> is kosher on Pesah. <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH <em> </em>1:147 states at length that
            even if the gentile's cow ate only <em>hametz</em>, its milk is permissible even according to the strict opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, <em>Pri Megadim</em> (in <em>Eshel Avraham</em> on �448) is concerned about causing benefit that derives from <em>hametz</em>.
            Thus, there is still uncertainty if less than twenty-four hours passed between when the cow ate <em>hametz</em> and the milking (if more than
            twenty-four hours passed, the milk is permissible). <em>Yeshu'ot Yaakov</em> also states that one should preferably use milk that was extracted
            from the cow more than twenty-four hours after the cow ate <em>hametz</em>, but if less than twenty-four hours passed, the milk is still
            permissible as long as the cow ate permissible foods in addition to the <em>hametz</em> (because of <em>zeh ve-zeh gorem</em>; see MB 448:33). Some
            authorities ruled stringently: <em>Kitzur </em>SA 117:13 cites both opinions and concludes: "One who guards his soul should be strict, and
            especially in places where the prevalent custom is to be stringent, God forbid one should be lenient." <em>Arugot Ha-bosem</em> �138 states that
            even according to those who permit the milk, a righteous person ("<em>ba'al nefesh</em>")<em> </em>should refrain from drinking it, since it has
            negative spiritual effects. <em>Ben Ish Hai</em> (Year One, Tzav 42) states that one should not drink milk from a gentile's cow out of concern that
            the gentile fed it <em>hametz</em>. R. Hayim Palachi writes similarly in <em>Ru'ah Hayim</em> 448:1.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the cow ate <em>hametz</em> before the <em>hametz</em> became prohibited and was milked after the <em>hametz</em> became prohibited, the vast
            majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that the milk is kosher for Pesah. <em>Sdei Hemed</em> mentions the opinion of <em>Rinun Yitzhak</em>
            forbidding the milk of a cow that ate <em>hametz</em> before Pesah and was milked after the <em>hametz</em> became forbidden, and states that this
            goes too far, since all other <em>poskim</em> say that this milk would be permissible. Nonetheless, because of this opinion some act stringently
and only purchase dairy products before Pesah. <em>Sdei Hemed</em> expands this topic in <em>Ma'arekhet Hametz U-matza </em>2:4, and see            <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 448:113 as well.

            7. According to <em>Nishmat Adam</em> and <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 1:147, if a Jew feeds his animal <em>hametz</em> on Pesah, the animal's milk is
            kosher for Pesah. Nonetheless, many others are stringent, not only because of <em>zeh ve-zeh gorem</em>, but because the Jew assists in the
            violation of a prohibition ("<em>mesayei'a</em>"). In fact, I heard from R. Weitman, the rabbi of Tnuva, that all dairy products produced on Pesah
            are made from the milk of cows that did not eat <em>hametz</em>, so that the milk will be acceptable to everyone and can be bought on Pesah.
            Another potential problem was that straw and possibly some grain might stick to the cows' bodies as they wallow in mud, and these grains might
            accidentally get mixed into the milk. If the milk was produced before Pesah, the taste of the grain is <em>batel be-shishim </em>even if it found
its way into the milk, and since this is a liquid mixture even Rema (447:4) would agree that the taste of the <em>hametz</em> is not            <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>. If the grain fell into the milk on Pesah, however, it is not <em>batel</em>. Although in the present case it is uncertain
            that any grain fell in, it would nevertheless be commendable to buy dairy products before Pesah. However, I heard from R. Weitman that Tnuva
            recently introduced the practice of filtering all the milk very thoroughly right after the milking, so that no grain that falls in would have
            enough time to flavor the milk. Thus, one may purchase dairy products on Pesah even according to the strictest opinions.

            8. Nevertheless, those who are lenient and purchase eggs on Pesah have committed no transgression, even if the eggs are not certified kosher for
            Pesah. As noted, even though a Jew owns the chickens and fed them <em>hametz</em>, there are lenient authorities. Furthermore, most of the food
            chickens consume on Pesah is not <em>hametz</em>, so even according to the stringent opinions it is unclear that these eggs are forbidden. Thus,
            there are two uncertainties ("<em>sfek sfeika</em>") about a rabbinic prohibition.

9<em>. Hametz </em>that was rendered unfit for a dog's consumption prior to Pesah is no longer considered <em>hametz</em>, and according to            <em>Ha-m</em><em>a'or</em>, Ran, and other Rishonim it may even be eaten on Pesah. Conversely, Rosh<em>,</em> Rabbeinu Yeruham, and other Rishonim
maintain that this type of <em>hametz</em> is rabbinically prohibited, since by eating it the person assigns importance ("<em>ahshevei</em>")            <em> </em>to it and shows that, for him, the food is still edible. Accordingly, SA 442:9 and MB 43 <em>ad loc</em>. rule that one may keep such an
            item over Pesah since it is unfit for a dog's consumption and thus not considered <em>hametz</em>. However, he may not eat it, since by eating it
            he assigns significance to it. Thus, according to <em>Ha-ma'or</em> and Ran one would certainly be permitted to swallow bitter <em>hametz</em>
            -containing<em> </em>pills on Pesah, and even according to Rosh and those who agree with him it may be permissible, since the Aharonim debate
whether swallowing <em>hametz</em> that is unfit for a dog's consumption for medicinal purposes assigns significance to the <em>hametz</em>.            <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em> �75 states this indeed assigns significance to the <em>hametz</em>, whereas <em>Ktav Sofer </em>OH <em> </em>�111 states
            that it does not impart significance. If the <em>hametz</em> is not the main ingredient in the pill, most Aharonim maintain that even Rosh would
concede that swallowing a bitter pill does not impart significance to the <em>hametz</em>. See <em>Havalim Ba-ne'imim</em> 5:4;            <em>Hazon Ish, </em>Mo'ed 116:8; <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 2:92; <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 2:60; SSK 40:74; and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it seems that SAH 442:22 derives from the case of <em>tiryaka</em>, an edible type of medicine, that Rosh would prohibit swallowing a pill
            as well. Most authorities, who are lenient, would differentiate between <em>tiryaka</em>, which is eaten by the ill, and medicines
            that are swallowed but not eaten. Moreover, even when the starch is from wheat flour, it generally did not have time to rise, and at worst would be
classified as <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em>, which did not undergo a complete leavening and is only rabbinically prohibited. Since this            <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em> is part of a mixture within a bitter pill, there is no reason to be stringent. Nevertheless, some incline toward
            stringency (<em>Arugot</em><em> Ha-bosem</em> �99, and <em>Atzei Ha-Levanon</em> �19). As stated, some have written that these pills are
            permissible according to the letter of the law, but the holy people of Israel are customarily strict even about avoiding <em>hametz </em>mixed into
            a bitter pill (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 10:25:20). On the other hand, <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> OH <em> </em>1:466:1 states that most pills do not
contain <em>hametz</em> at all. It is further stated there in the name of R.<em> </em>Ovadia Yosef that even though he writes in            <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 2:60 that only a genuinely sick person may be lenient, if it is uncertain whether or not the pill contains <em>hametz</em>,
            there is no need to ascertain. As noted, the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is not at all prohibited to swallow a bitter pill,
            and even one with a minor ailment may take a pill that contains <em>hametz </em>rendered unfit for a dog before Pesah started.

            10. This debate is very extensive, and the key questions are: is something that was <em>batel be-shishim </em>before Pesah <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em>
once Pesah begins? Even if not, would a stabilizing agent ("<em>davar ha-ma'amid</em>") be any different? And what if it is not the sole agent? See            <em>Yalkut Yosef, </em>Mo'adim p. 358 which responds to <em>Minhat Yitzhak</em>'s criticism of R. Ovadia Yosef. Badatz and many other
            kosher-certification agencies are very strict about citric acid and similar products. Nevertheless, according to R. She'ar Yashuv Cohen's long
            essay in <em>Tehumin</em> vol. 1, it seems clear that there is no reason for concern that citric acid contains <em>hametz</em>. More precisely: the
            starch is first separated from the gluten by spinning the wheat flour in water for six minutes. As we know, it takes eighteen minutes for flour and
            water to become <em>hametz</em>, so the flour could not have become <em>hametz</em> in those six minutes. By then the starch has already been
            separated from the gluten, and it is well known that the leavening process takes place in the gluten. Thus once the starch has been isolated from
            the gluten, it can no longer become <em>hametz</em>. The starch is then heated to 140� Celsius until it liquefies as dextrose (also known as
            glucose). This heating process destroys the existing molecules and changes their composition. To dispel any doubt, an attempt was made to leaven
            this substance, but it was unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <p>
R. Halperin writes that at worst this substance can be considered <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em>, which is rabbinically prohibited, becomes            <em>batel</em> in any mixture prior to Pesah, and would be <em>hozer ve-ne'or </em>on Pesah. According to R. She'ar Yashuv Cohen, this substance is
            not even considered <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em>, which is dough whose leavening process was halted after it began; the substance in question
            never even began the leavening process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The liquid dextrose is then mixed with sulfur to destroy the enzymes in the glucose and render it inert and unable to ferment. Since it never had
            the chance to become <em>hametz</em>, it certainly will not become <em>hametz</em> in the future. This is the first stage of the process, which
            shows that the extracted starch does not become <em>hametz</em>. The next step is to place the liquid into large vats, to feed the molds. It is
            left until the mold has finished digesting all of the dextrose and excreted another substance: citric acid. Thus, citric acid is not a product of
            the starch, but a product of the mold. Just as if one used organic fertilizer that contained remnants of bread to fertilize vegetables, the
            vegetables would undoubtedly be kosher for Pesah, certainly citric acid excreted by molds that digested a liquid that never became <em>hametz</em>
            in the first place would be <em>kosher</em> for Pesah. This conclusion has major implications for other industrial ingredients that use wheat
            starch that never became <em>hametz</em> and that undergoes fundamental alterations before being reintegrated into food.

            11. The Rishonim disagree about the principle that equates anointing with drinking: some apply it only to Yom Kippur and <em>teruma</em> oil, while
            others hold that it applies to other prohibitions, though only on the rabbinic level. The question arises with regard to soap made of lard, and
            many Aharonim tend toward stringency if the item is for enjoyment and leniently if it is needed for health reasons (see <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em>
            4:53). They incline toward leniency if the lard's taste has been befouled (AHS YD<em> </em>117:29). Regarding Pesah, there is a more stringent
aspect, namely, that one is forbidden to derive any benefit from <em>hametz</em>, but there is also a more lenient aspect, namely, that the            <em>hametz</em> lost its status when it became inedible before Pesah, making it less strict than something that had been forbidden from the outset.
            In practice, <em>Responsa</em> <em>Sho'el U-meishiv </em>3:2:146 states that one may keep soap that contains <em>hametz</em> over Pesah since its
            taste has been befouled. It does not address whether or not the soap may be used on Pesah. <em>Responsa</em> <em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 4:24:43 states
            that one may not use cosmetics that contain wheat-derived alcohol, since the alcohol helps spread their scent and is thus significant. The alcohol
            is not <em>batel </em>since it can be isolated from the rest of the mixture. <em>Responsa </em><em>Divrei Nahum</em> �56 states that the law
follows the current situation, namely, that the taste of the <em>hametz</em> has been befouled, and the mixture is thus permissible.            <em>Hazon Ish</em>, Demai 15:1 suggests that only something edible may not be used as an ointment. <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 3:62 rules leniently in
            the case of an ointment that contains <em>hametz </em>that is used for health purposes. <em>Bedikat</em><em> Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 2:43 summarizes
            the topic and rules stringently unless it is uncertain whether a product contains <em>hametz</em>, in which case one may be lenient. It seems to me
            that even those who rule stringently should distinguish between fat-based soap and contemporary soaps: fat-based soaps are absorbed in the skin and
            may be considered ointments, whereas contemporary soaps merely clean and remove dirt from the body, but are not absorbed into it. I have thus
            distinguished between ointments and creams, which are absorbed into the body, and soaps and shampoos, which are not (though hair conditioner may be
            more akin to an ointment). In practice, I heard from R. Nachum Rabinovitch that he rules leniently regarding all products unfit for a dog's
            consumption, as did his mentor, R. Pinchas Hirschprung. This is the opinion of R. Dov Lior as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, the vast majority of cosmetic products produced in Israel do not contain wheat-derived alcohol. Even the majority of products produced
            abroad do not contain wheat-derived alcohol, since it is more expensive than potato-derived alcohol. However, a few products in fact contain
            wheat-derived alcohol, and according to the stringent views one should not use them on Pesah. Still, when one has a product and is not sure whether
            it contains wheat-derived alcohol, even if he is normally stringent he may be lenient, based on a combination of several uncertainties and doubts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue arises regarding the use of products that contain wheat germ oil, which is a source of Vitamin E, since it is unclear whether liquids
            exuded by wheat are considered <em>hametz</em>. According to Rav Kook (<em>Orah Mishpat </em>p. 129), even if these liquids are forbidden, they
            were already <em>batel be-shishim </em>before Pesah and are not <em>hozer ve-ne'or</em> on Pesah. Moreover, many authorities maintain that even if
            this liquid was considered <em>hametz</em>, since it is not fit for consumption it loses its status as <em>hametz</em>. Another issue arises
            regarding lotions, although it is not certain that wheat starch-based lotions are considered <em>hametz</em>, and moreover they are inedible.
            Therefore, in practice, one may be lenient and use any cosmetic product not fit for consumption.
