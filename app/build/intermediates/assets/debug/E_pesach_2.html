    Chapter Two: General Rules of the Prohibition against <em>Hametz</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. Four <em>Mitzvot</em> Concerning the Prohibition against <em>Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Four Torah commandments deal with the prohibition against <em>hametz</em> on Pesah: three negative and one positive.
</p>
<p>
    The first prohibition is to refrain from eating <em>hametz</em>, as it is written, "And <em>hametz</em> shall not be eaten" (Shemot 13:3). Our Sages taught
    that the prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> on Pesah includes not deriving any kind of benefit from the <em>hametz</em>. The Torah also says, "You
    shall not eat anything leavened; in all of your settlements you shall eat <em>matzot</em>" (Shemot 12:20). Our Sages concluded from this verse that not
    only something that had fermented on its own is prohibited, but even food that had been leavened by some external agent may not be eaten on Pesah. It must
    be noted that the Torah was particularly stringent concerning the prohibition against eating <em>hametz.</em> Almost all of the Torah's food prohibitions
are punishable by lashes, while eating <em>hametz</em> on Pesah is punishable by <em>karet</em> (extirpation), as it is written, "whoever eats    <em>hametz</em> from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel" (Shemot 12:15).
</p>
<p>
    The second prohibition is that no <em>hametz</em> may be found in our possession, as it is written, "Seven days there shall be no <em>se'or</em> found in
    your homes" (Shemot 12:19). <em>Se'or</em> is the leavening agent that one uses to make dough ferment. This verse means not only that <em>se'or</em> is
    forbidden, but also that no <em>hametz</em> may be found in our possession on Pesah. This prohibition is often called <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
</p>
<p>
The third prohibition is that no <em>hametz</em> may be seen in our possession, as it is written: "<em>Matzot</em> shall be eaten seven days; and no    <em>hametz</em> of yours shall be seen, and no <em>se'or</em> of yours shall be seen within all your borders" (Shemot 13:7). One violates the second
    prohibition (<em>bal yimatzei</em>) and this third prohibition (called <em>bal yera'eh</em>) only if one has in his possession on Pesah at least one
    olive's bulk (<em>kezayit</em>) of <em>hametz.</em> If the volume of the <em>hametz</em> that remained in one's possession was less than a <em>kezayit</em>
    , he does not violate <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei </em>on account of that <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth mitzva - a positive commandment - is to get rid of <em>hametz</em> and <em>se'or </em>in advance of Pesah, as it is written, "Seven days you
    shall eat <em>matzot</em>; however, on the first day you shall remove the <em>se'or</em> from your houses" (Shemot 12:15).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
The Times When <em>Hametz</em> Is Prohibited by Torah Law and by Rabbinic Law
</h2>
<p>
    Although the prohibition against <em>hametz</em> applies primarily during the seven days of <em>Hag</em> <em>Ha-matzot</em>, from the fifteenth through the
    twenty-first of Nisan, nevertheless we were commanded to remove <em>hametz</em> from our homes at noon on the fourteenth of Nisan, Erev Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    The prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> also begins at noon on the fourteenth, as is written, "And you shall sacrifice the Pesah [offering] to G-d ...
    you shall not eat <em>hametz</em> with it" (Devarim 16:2-3). This prohibits the eating of <em>hametz</em> from the time fit for bringing the Pesah
    sacrifice, i.e., at noon on the fourteenth of Nisan. This prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> includes the prohibition against deriving any benefit
    from it.

</p>
<p>
    In order to distance one further from possibly violating commandments, the Sages added to the prohibitions and forbade gaining benefit from <em>hametz</em>
    for an additional hour. They also forbade eating <em>hametz</em> for two extra hours, since on a cloudy day people are likely to err by as much as two
    hours.
</p>
<p>
    These times are calculated by dividing the day into twelve equal parts, each of which is called "a seasonal hour" ("<em>sha'ah zmanit</em>"). Thus, one may
    eat <em>hametz </em>for the first four seasonal hours of the fourteenth. During the fifth hour it is rabbinically forbidden to eat <em>hametz</em>, but it
    is permissible to derive benefit from it by, for example, feeding it to an animal or selling it to a gentile. When the sixth hour of the day begins,
    possession of <em>hametz</em> becomes prohibited rabbinically, and if one forgot to sell it to a gentile, it must be destroyed. When midday arrives, that
    is, after the sixth hour ends, <em>hametz</em> is forbidden by Torah law both for consumption and for deriving any benefit, and one must dispose of it as
    soon as possible. Every moment that one does not get rid of it, he violates the positive commandment to remove the <em>hametz</em> (see below 3:6
    concerning the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Once the holiday begins, two additional prohibitions apply: <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    The prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> also becomes more severe: one who willfully eats <em>hametz</em> after midday on the fourteenth is
    punishable by lashes only, whereas one who willfully eats <em>hametz</em> after the holiday begins is punishable by extirpation. This is based on the
    verse: "whoever eats <em>hametz</em>, from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel" (Shemot 12:15).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hametz </em>becomes permissible once again after Pesah, except that our Sages forbade <em>hametz</em> that belonged to a Jew during the holiday ("<em>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesah</em>"). Since by keeping the <em>hametz</em> on Pesah he violated the prohibitions of <em>bal yera'eh </em>and    <em>bal yimatzei</em>, the Sages prohibited eating or gaining benefit from that <em>hametz </em>even after Pesah. <em>Hametz </em>that was in the
    possession of a gentile during Pesah, however, is permissible; a Jew may buy it and eat it (SA 448:1-3).
</p>

3. What Is <em>Hametz</em> and What Is <em>Se'or</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>hametz</em> that is prohibited by the Torah on Pesah is any one of the five species of cereal grains that came into contact with water and
fermented. The five species are wheat (<em>hitta</em>), barley (<em>se'ora</em>), oats (<em>shibolet shu'al</em>), rye (<em>shifon</em>), and spelt (    <em>kusmin</em>). These species are used to make bread, the staple food of mankind. The Sages ordained a special blessing to be recited before eating bread
- "Who brings forth bread from the earth" ("<em>ha-motzi lehem min ha-aretz</em>"). After eating bread, the Torah commanded us to recite    <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>. So that bread will be tasty and easy to digest, its dough is fermented and made to rise.
</p>
<p>
    There are two types of leaven products: <em>hametz</em> and <em>se'or</em>. Both are produced by mixing flour and water. <em>Hametz</em> is the regular
    leavening of dough to bake bread and cakes. The fermentation is accomplished by leaving the dough at rest without handling it. If one wants the leavening
    to be faster and of higher quality, one mixes <em>se'or</em> (sourdough) into the dough. <em>Se'or</em> is the second type of leavening. It is produced by
    leaving <em>hametz</em> for a long time, so that it continues to effervesce and ferment, until it tastes so sour that people cannot eat it. As noted, the
    purpose of <em>se'or</em> is to hasten and improve the quality of the leavening process of various types of dough, for the preparation of breads and cakes.
    More specifically, <em>hametz</em> is intended for eating while <em>se'or</em> is a leavening agent in preparing <em>hametz</em> foods. The Torah
prohibited both, and the law is the same regarding both. One who leaves a <em>kezayit</em> of either of them in his possession during Pesah violates    <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em> (<em>Beitza</em> 7b).
</p>
<p>
    But if flour of the five cereal grains is mixed with water, kneaded rapidly, and put it into an oven immediately, then the dough will not have enough time
    to rise. This is the matza that we are commanded to eat on the first night of Pesah, as a remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt, as is written, "And the
    people picked up their dough before it fermented" (Shemot 12:34). Thus, specifically those species of grain that may become <em>hametz </em>are the species
    from which one makes matza for the mitzva (<em>Pesahim</em> 35a).
</p>
<p>
    Although rice and millet are similar to the five species of cereal grain, and although they rise, they do not undergo a complete fermentation process as
    the five cereal species do. Therefore, the prohibition against <em>hametz</em> does not apply to them, and if one made matza out of one of them, one does
    not fulfill any mitzva with it on Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    Note that <em>kusmin </em>(spelt) is not the same as <em>kusemet </em>(buckwheat). The former is one of the five species of cereal grain, whereas the
    latter is a type of legume and may be eaten on Pesah by those who eat <em>kitniyot</em>; even among those who do not eat <em>kitniyot</em>, it is permitted
    for sick people (MB 453:4, 7. Note that some mix up the names and call spelt <em>kusemet</em>).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. The Definition of Leavening Dough
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, the difference between bread and matza is that the dough used for making bread has undergone a leavening process resulting from the
fermentation of ingredients within the flour that have come into contact with water. In order to augment the leavening process, bakers customarily mix    <em>se'or</em> into the dough, causing the dough to ferment more thoroughly and quickly. However, even without the leavening agent, if dough were left
    without kneading, it would ferment and rise. Therefore, when preparing <em>matzot</em> one must work quickly to ensure that the leavening process within
    the dough does not begin.
</p>
<p>
    As long as the dough is in motion, being kneaded, it does not become <em>hametz</em>. Even if the kneading were to continue an entire day, the dough would
    not become <em>hametz</em>, since kneading inhibits the leavening process. However, if the dough sat motionless for eighteen minutes, the leavening process
    has begun and all the prohibitions concerning <em>hametz</em> apply to it. This applies to normal conditions, but where it is hotter, the leavening process
    is accelerated, and the dough becomes <em>hametz</em> in even less than eighteen minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Cracks appearing in the dough are a physical indication that the dough has become <em>hametz</em>. Even if eighteen minutes without kneading had not yet
passed, since there are cracks in the dough, it has certainly become <em>hametz</em>; apparently conditions were warm and so it took less time to become<em>hametz</em>. Moreover, the kneading may have been inadequate, so that certain parts of the dough were neglected, causing those areas to become    <em>hametz</em>. Even if there are only a few cracks, and they appeared only in part of the dough, the entire dough is <em>hametz</em>. If no cracks
    appeared but the dough blanched, it is <em>hametz</em> <em>nuksheh</em> (hardened <em>hametz</em>; see next section), which is rabbinically forbidden (SA
    459:2).

</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. <em>Hametz Nuksheh </em>(Hardened <em>Hametz</em>)
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>hametz</em> that the Torah forbade is <em>hametz gamur </em>(absolute <em>hametz</em>), meaning that the leavening process has been completed, and
the food has become edible. But if fermentation had begun but not concluded, and from the outset the food was barely edible, then it is called "    <em>hametz nuksheh.</em>" According to most <em>poskim</em>, <em>hametz nuksheh</em> is not forbidden by Torah law, but the Sages prohibited it so that
    people would not err and come to eat or keep real <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    An example of <em>hametz nuksheh </em>is the glue that scribes used to prepare from flour and water for gluing paper. Since its leavening process was never
    completed, and it is barely edible, it is <em>hametz nuksheh</em>, and the Sages forbade eating it or keeping it on Pesah (MB 442:2). If its form was
    changed, as when the glue is used to stick papers together, then one is allowed to keep it. Others are more stringent and maintain that if the glue
    protrudes from between the pages, then it is considered as if it has maintained its same form, and it is forbidden to keep it on Pesah (SA and Rema 242:3).
</p>
<p>
Similarly, dough that began to ferment to the point that its surface blanched, but the surface was not cracked as with true leavening, is considered    <em>hametz</em> <em>nuksheh</em>, and it is forbidden by rabbinic law to eat or keep it on Pesah (SA 459:2).

</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. <em>Hametz</em> So Spoiled That a Dog Would Not Eat It
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Hametz</em>
that was originally fit for eating, but that became moldy or spoiled to the point that it is not fit for human consumption, is still considered    <em>hametz gamur</em>, since it can still be used as a leavening agent. In other words, even though, in general, all forbidden foods become no longer
forbidden once they are no longer fit for human consumption, <em>hametz</em> is different. Since it can still help in the preparation of food, it is like    <em>se'or</em>, which serves as a leavening agent and is therefore considered <em>hametz</em>. However, if it became so spoiled that it is not fit for
    consumption by a dog, then it is not considered food at all. Therefore, the law of <em>hametz</em> does not apply to it and it is permissible to keep it
    during Pesah and to gain benefit from it (SA 442:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 10). By rabbinic decree, however, it is still forbidden to eat it on its own, for
    one who eats it - even though he is doing something very unusual - demonstrates that he still considers this <em>hametz</em> to be food (MB<em> </em>442,
    43).
</p>
<p>
    The yardstick of being fit for a dog's consumption is relevant only for measuring the spoilage of <em>hametz</em> or <em>se'or</em>. But if <em>se'or</em>
    was not spoiled, but only became so sour that it is not fit even for a dog, since it is good <em>se'or</em> (that functions as a leavening agent and is
    usable like regular yeast), all the laws of <em>hametz</em> apply to it, and one is required by Torah law to destroy it (BHL 442:9).
</p>
<p>
    This law - that one does not have to burn <em>hametz</em> that was spoiled to the point of not being fit for a dog's consumption - applies only if it
    became spoiled before the time that <em>hametz</em> becomes prohibited. But if it was fit to be eaten by a dog when the prohibition of <em>hametz</em>
began, then even if it became spoiled later, to the point of not being fit for a dog's consumption, one must burn it. Once the mitzva of eliminating the    <em>hametz</em> is in effect, one does not discharge his obligation until he has destroyed the <em>hametz </em>completely (MB 442:9; see below, ch. 5, n.
    5).
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
Note that all of these laws are conditional on the <em>hametz</em> having initially been fit for human consumption, or for preparing food for humans as    <em>se'or</em>. If, however, it was not fit for human consumption at all from the beginning, then even if it was fit to be eaten by a dog, no prohibition
applies to it. If from the beginning it was not intended for consumption, but it was in fact barely fit for human consumption, then it is    <em>hametz nuksheh</em>, as described above.
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. Ways in Which There Is No Leavening
</h2>
<p>
    As noted, there are five types of grain that can become <em>hametz</em> after touching water. However, if they are roasted in fire, they can no longer
    become <em>hametz</em>, and in principle they may be mixed with water. Nevertheless, the Sages were concerned lest the roasting not be thorough, and thus
    the grain would become <em>hametz </em>when coming into contact with water. Therefore, one must treat them just as one treats regular cereal grains. If
    they became wet and eighteen minutes passed, we suspect they may have become <em>hametz</em>, and it is forbidden to gain any benefit from them, and one
    must destroy them (SA 463:3; MB <em>ad loc</em> 7).
</p>
<p>
    The above concerns kernels of grain that were roasted in fire, but if it was flour that was roasted, there are Rishonim who are lenient, maintaining that
one need not suspect that the flour was not roasted well. Thus, it is permissible to mix such flour with water or in a cooked food without concern for    <em>hametz</em> (Rashi, Rambam). However, many Rishonim hold that in the case of flour, as well, one must be concerned that it may have not been roasted
    thoroughly (Rabbeinu Yeruham, <em>Hagahot Sefer Mitzvot Katan</em>, <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em>, and others). The Aharonim rule that one must not mix
    roasted flour with water or in a cooked food, lest it become <em>hametz</em>. Nevertheless, if one did make such a mixture, even though it is forbidden to
    eat it, it is permissible to keep it until after Pesah and to eat it then (MB 463:8; <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>13).
</p>
<p>
    However, concerning matza that was properly baked, it is agreed that it cannot become leavened again. Accordingly, it is permissible to soak matza and
    matza meal in water, and, indeed, this is what most people do. Hasidim, however, customarily do not eat soaked matza (see below 8:2).
</p>
<p>
    Scalding the grains or the flour in boiling water also destroys the capacity for becoming <em>hametz</em>. However, the Ge'onim prohibited doing so, for
    today no one knows how to do this scalding, and if the boiling does not destroy the potential for becoming <em>hametz</em>, an opposite process of rapid
    fermentation may be generated, as heat may hasten fermentation. Therefore, scalded grains or flour are treated just like <em>hametz</em>: it is forbidden
    to gain any benefit from them and one must burn them (SA 454:3; MB 13).
</p>
<p>
    Flour on which water dripped, drop by drop, continuously, even all day long, does not become <em>hametz</em>, since the falling of the drops disturbs the
    flour and shakes it, and does not allow the leavening process to develop. Immediately upon cessation of the dripping, one should knead the dough and bake
    it. If there is doubt that some of the dripping may not have been continuous, then this is a doubt concerning a law of Torah, and one must relate to that
    flour as <em>hametz</em> and burn it (<em>Pesahim</em> 39b; SA<em> </em>466:6).
</p>
<p>
    Another way to prevent the dough from fermenting is by soaking it in cold water (<em>Pesahim</em> 46a; SA 457:2). Preferably, one should not do so, lest
    the water not be cold enough, allowing the dough to ferment (Rosh, MB<em> </em>454:18).
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Flour that was kneaded with fruit juice does not become leavened at all, but if even a little water was added to the mixture, then it will become leavened
    (<em>matza ashira</em> will be explained below [8:1]).

. The mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em> applies from noon on the fourteenth, as it is written, "However, on the first day you shall remove the<em>se'or</em> from your houses" (Shemot 12:15). The Sages demonstrated from other verses that "the first day" refers to Erev Pesah. Since the<em>hametz</em> must already have been removed by the onset of the holiday itself so as not to violate<em> bal yera'eh </em>and<em>bal yimatzei </em>, the mitzva of removing the <em>hametz</em> must be in the middle of the day preceding Pesah, that is, at noon (            <em>Pesahim</em> 4b).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            The prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> and obtaining any benefit from it applies from noon on the fourteenth, according to R. Yehuda, as
            explained in <em>Pesahim</em> 28a. Rambam, as well as R. Yitzhak ibn Gi'at, Rosh, and most Rishonim, ruled in accordance with this view. R.
Shimon's view is that the prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> begins with the holiday itself, and it is only the mitzva of removing the            <em>hametz</em> that comes into effect at noon on the fourteenth. Some Rishonim rule in accordance with this view, although they disagreed about
            what the mitzva of getting rid of <em>hametz</em> entails according to R. Shimon. Let us mention two approaches. According to Ramban and Raavad,
            since one must get rid of the <em>hametz</em>, he is also not allowed to eat it; yet Torah law permits him to benefit from it in the course of its
being burned. Only the Sages prohibited deriving any benefit from the <em>hametz</em> from the beginning of the sixth hour of the day. According to            <em>Ha-ma'or</em>, the mitzva of disposing of the <em>hametz</em> does not imply a prohibition against eating it, since by eating it, one is, in
            fact, disposing of it (see <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit</em>, vol. 16, s.v. "hametz", p. 66; <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em>, p. 8, n. 3). Again, the view
            of most <em>poskim</em> is that the <em>halakha</em> follows R. Yehuda's view that the prohibition against eating <em>hametz</em> and the
            prohibition against deriving any benefit from <em>hametz</em> are of Torah origin, and apply from noon. This is how the <em>halakha</em> is decided
            in SA<em> </em>(443:1).

            . This is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, since for these prohibitions the term "seven days" is stated explicitly; see MB 443:1 in the name of
            MA and others. However, SHT<em> </em>443:2 states that not everyone agrees to this, and according to Rashi the prohibition starts on midday of the
            fourteenth. This also seems to be the opinion of Rabbeinu Hananel and <em>Itur</em>, namely, that according to R. Yehuda these prohibitions are
            like the prohibition of eating and begin at midday.

            . The rising of the dough indicates that it has become <em>hametz</em> (Me'iri), and other symptoms, namely, cracks in the dough, a blanched
            appearance, and the time that has elapsed, are only relevant in a case where the dough did not begin to rise. However, there are situations in
            which the dough rises but this does not indicate that it has become <em>hametz</em>; rather, it has undergone what the Sages call "<em>sirhon</em>"
            (spoilage). This applies to the case of rice, or of flour mixed with fruit juice, according to most <em>poskim</em>. However, when wheat flour
            mixes with water and begins to rise, this is in fact a sign that the mixture has become <em>hametz</em>. If the dough sat and was not kneaded for
            the time that it takes to walk one <em>mil</em>, it has become <em>hametz</em> even if there is no visible indication, as explained in the Mishna
            and Gemara in <em>Pesahim</em> 46a. SA 459:2 explains that this amount of time is eighteen minutes, although Rambam and R. Ovadia of Bertinoro
            maintain that it is twenty-four minutes. BHL <em>ad loc.</em> rules that these lenient positions may be relied upon to prevent a significant loss
            of money, and that the authorities rule according to the <em>Shulhan Arukh</em> without even mentioning the more lenient opinion because of the
            strict nature of the prohibition of <em>hametz</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Rashi and Me'iri<em>, </em>however, one must check the amount of time that the dough has been sitting only when it is unclear whether
            or not the leavening process has begun: if more than the time it takes to walk one <em>mil </em>has elapsed, the dough is <em>hametz</em>, and vice
versa. If one is certain that the dough is not <em>hametz</em>, even if it has been sitting for longer than the time that it takes to walk one            <em>mil</em>, it is not considered <em>hametz</em><em>.</em> Nonetheless, according to most Rishonim<em> </em>in any situation where the dough has
            sat for longer than it takes to walk one <em>mil</em>, the dough is <em>hametz</em>. See, for example, MT, Laws of<em> Hametz </em>and Matza 5:13;
            SA 459:2. <em>Pri Megadim</em>'s introduction to �467 contends that such dough is complete <em>hametz</em>;<em> </em>eating it on Pesah<em> </em>
            incurs the punishment of <em>karet</em>. Rashbatz writes that one must suspect that such dough has become <em>hametz</em>. In a warm place, dough
            becomes <em>hametz </em>in less than the time it takes to walk a <em>mil</em>, as written in <em>Aguda</em> in the name of the Ge'onim. This is the
            halakhic consensus, as it is also the ruling of <em>Yerei'im</em>, <em>Mordechai</em>, and <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em>. Additionally, Rosh writes
that even if the dough became warm in one's hands, the dough will become <em>hametz</em> more quickly. This is cited in SA and Rema 459:2 (see also<em>Birur Halakha </em>46a). Although there is dispute as to whether or not the "sitting times" of the dough are combined,            <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> rules that a full kneading of the dough cancels the previous sitting time, though merely poking the dough would not be
            effective. This is cited in MB<em> </em>459:16.

            <em>Pesahim</em>
            222222 48b states: "as long as the dough is being worked it cannot become <em>hametz</em><em>.</em>" The vast majority of Rishonim, including
            Rambam in <em>Laws of Hametz and Matza </em>5:3 and <em>Tur </em>and SA 459:2, explain that as long as one keeps kneading the dough it will not
            become <em>hametz</em>, even if he does so for the entire day. Yet it appears that the Yerushalmi disagrees with the Bavli and says that if one
            kneaded the dough for the amount of time that it takes to walk four <em>mil</em>, the dough is considered <em>hametz</em>. <em>Bah</em> cites Ri'az
            that ideally we should act in accordance with the Yerushalmi. There is an even more stringent opinion - Ritva's - according to which as long as one
            kneads the dough at the appropriate pace so that he will complete the kneading in less time than it would take to walk one <em>mil</em>, the dough
does not become <em>hametz</em>. However, if the kneading goes on for longer than this time, the dough is considered <em>hametz</em> (see            <em>Birur Halakha</em> on <em>Pesahim </em>48b; <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit</em>,<em> </em>s.v.<em>"</em>hametz,<em>"</em> �5, pp. 74-75). Even
            though the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> disagree with Ritva, they rule that it is still preferable to be stringent and complete the kneading
            process within eighteen minutes, as explained in AHS 459:7.

            . The opinion of SA 447:12 is that <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em> is only rabbinically forbidden, and therefore, <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em>
            that existed over Pesah is not forbidden after Pesah. This is also the opinion of SAH 442:20-21 and MB<em> </em>442:2, based on the opinion of most
            Rishonim. However, several Rishonim are of the opinion that <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em> is forbidden by Torah law. There are two related
issues: the prohibition of eating <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em> and the prohibition of keeping <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em> (see<em>Birur Halakha </em>on <em>Pesahim</em> 48b regarding the issue of eating, and 42a regarding the issue of keeping it over Pesah). See also the            <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit</em> entry <em>"Hametz Nuksheh"</em> p. 108 (definition) and pp. 110-115 (extent of the prohibition). According to
Rabbeinu Tam<em> </em>and many other <em>poskim</em>, flour that is mixed with fruit juice and a little bit of water is also considered            <em>hametz</em><em> nuksheh</em>. See below (8:1) regarding <em>matza ashira</em>.

            . MB 442:44<em> </em>cites <em>Hok Yaakov</em>, which quotes <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> that if a gentile prepared <em>hametz</em> on Pesah and
            then made it inedible even for dogs, it is prohibited for a Jew to gain any benefit from it, since it had been proper <em>hametz</em> during a time
            when <em>hametz</em> was forbidden. See also <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 3:62, which is lenient in this matter. <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 2:60 summarizes
            the opinions regarding this issue. See also <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 2:27-32, which explains this topic at length, and in n. 87 explains
            that according to Rambam and Rosh<em>, hametz</em> that became inedible for humans and is still edible for dogs but would not cause any other dough
            to become <em>hametz</em> need not be burned; Raavad<em> </em>disagrees. See AHS<em> </em>YD<em> </em>103:1-5<em> </em>regarding other forbidden
            foods that are no longer prohibited when they become unfit for human consumption.

            . Does freezing the dough halt the leavening process? <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 3:59 states that one may not assume that freezing halts the process,
since perhaps the cold just slows down the leavening process but does not stop it completely. On the other hand, <em>Helkat Yaakov</em> 3:166 and            <em>Devar Yehoshua</em> 2:58 are lenient based on the fact that freezing the dough stops the leavening process completely. Nevertheless, one should
            not purposely prepare dough to freeze and bake on Pesah, but if one prepared dough before Pesah and did not have a chance to bake it before Pesah,
            as long as the dough has not yet risen, he may freeze the dough and bake it after Pesah.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the processes that slow the leavening process are summarized in the <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit </em>entry <em>"Hametz"</em> pp. 83-89. And
            even though we generally are not lenient when it comes to scalding the dough, there are practical applications when dealing with a dangerously sick
            person, where it is better to minimize the number of prohibitions involved, as explained in MB<em> </em>454:13.
