    Chapter Twenty-Five: <strong>The <em>Ma'ariv</em> Prayer</strong>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. <em>Keriat Shema</em> and Its <em>Berachot</em>
</h2>
<p>
The recital of <em>Keriat Shema </em>commands center stage at the beginning of the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer. It is a biblical commandment to recite    <em>Keriat Shema</em> at night and in the morning, as written in the paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> and <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em>, "When you lie down and
    when you get up." It is also a mitzvah to remember the Exodus from Egypt during the day and at night, as it is written (Deuteronomy 16:3), "Therefore you
will remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your life." From the words "<strong>all</strong> the days" (<strong><em>kol</em></strong><em> yemei chayechah</em>), <em>Chazal</em> learn that it is a mitzvah to remember the Exodus from Egypt both at day and at night (    <em>Mishnah Berachot</em> 12:2). For that reason, the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph is also recited at night, since the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned at its
    end. The <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph, which discusses the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em>, primarily applies to the day, and although one can fulfill the
    nighttime mitzvah of remembering the Exodus from Egypt with other verses, it is customary to remember the Exodus by reciting <em>Vayomer</em>, since these
    verses are familiar to all (<em>Tosafot Yom Tov</em> there). In addition, combined with the first two paragraphs of <em>Shema</em>, it contains 248 words
    (paralleling the 248 organs in the body as explained earlier in this book 15:12), and by reciting all three paragraphs, one completely accepts upon himself
    the yoke of Heaven (see 15:3-4 in this book. The detailed laws of <em>Keriat Shema</em> are clarified in chapter 15).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>
    added the recital of two <em>berachot</em> before <em>Keriat Shema</em> and two <em>berachot</em> after it. The first, "<em>Ma'ariv Aravim</em>," is a
blessing of praise concerning the passage of time from day to night, and parallels <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yotzer Or</em> in <em>Shacharit</em>. The second, "    <em>Ahavat Olam</em>," is praise that refers to Hashem's love for Israel and the giving of the Torah. The third, "<em>Emet V'Emunah</em>," is praise about
    the redemption. In the fourth, "Hashkiveinu," we ask Hashem to protect us at night and watch over us when we sleep (see also earlier in this book 16:1).
    Hence, <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> are comprised of seven blessings, three in <em>Shacharit</em> and four in <em>Ma'ariv</em>; and the <em>Yerushalmi</em>
    (<em>Berachot</em>, chapter 1, halachah 5) states that they were instituted based on the verse (Psalms, 119:164), "<em>Sheva bayom hillalticha</em>" ("I
    praise You seven times daily.")
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. The <em>Ma'ariv Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Yaakov Avinu established the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer, and based on this, <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah </em>instituted praying <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> at
    night. They set the time of <em>Ma'ariv </em>to correspond to the offering of the organs and fats of the sacrifices, for whatever they did not succeed in
    burning during the day would be burned throughout the night (<em>Berachot</em> 26b). However, <em>Ma'ariv</em> is optional (<em>reshut</em>). It is a
    mitzvah to recite <em>Ma'ariv</em>, but not an obligation. Whoever wanted to engage himself in a different mitzvah, or had already gone to sleep, or found
    it difficult to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em> for another reason, was not required to do so. The reason that <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em> are different
    from <em>Ma'ariv</em> is that <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em> were instituted to correspond to the <em>Tamid</em> offering of the morning and
    afternoon, specifically, to correspond to the sprinkling of their blood. Just as a person who does not sprinkle the blood does not fulfill his obligation
    of bringing the offering, so too, one is obligated to pray <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>. However, <em>Ma'ariv</em> was instituted to correspond
    to the offering of the organs and fats upon the altar. Although it is a mitzvah to bring them, if they were not brought, the offering still remained valid.
    Therefore, the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer is optional.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, throughout the generations, all of Israel became accustomed to praying <em>Ma'ariv</em>. Therefore, at the time of the <em>Rishonim</em> it
    was established as obligatory. Even so, <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> is not recited in it, since, in essence, the prayer is optional. Thus, <em>Chazal</em>
did not institute an <em>Amidah</em> repetition for it, to fulfill the obligation of the uneducated (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 237:1).    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
Women are exempt from praying <em>Ma'ariv</em>, even according to those who maintain that women are obligated to pray all the prayers instituted by the    <em>Chachamim</em>. A woman's obligation pertains to <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>, which were established as obligatory, however, she is exempt
    from <em>Ma'ariv</em> which is optional. The men's <em>minhag</em> of accepting upon themselves the recitation of<em> Ma'ariv</em> as an obligation does
    not apply to women.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. The Order of the <em>Ma'ariv</em> Prayer
</h2>
<p>
The <em>Rishonim</em> write that before <em>Barchu</em> it is customary to recite three verses, which open with the words, "    <em>V'Hu Rachum yechaper avon</em>," ("He, the merciful One, atones iniquity"), to request atonement for the sins that we committed throughout the day.
    Furthermore, at night, the Divine attribute of judgment is in force and <em>mechablim</em> (destructive spiritual agents) are given permission to harm.
    Therefore, we ask, "<em>V'Hu Rachum yechaper avon...</em>" (see <em>Tur</em> and <em>Beit Yosef</em> 237 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 235:5). On Shabbat and
    Festivals, <em>V'Hu Rachum</em> is not recited.
</p>
<p>
According to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em>, three verses beginning with the words, "<em>Hashem Tzevakot</em>..." are recited before the beginning of<em>Ma'ariv</em>, and according to the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Chassidim</em>, "<em>Shir HaMa'alot</em>..." is recited. Followers of both    <em>minhagim</em> recite Half-<em>Kaddish</em> afterwards and then <em>V'Hu Rachum</em>. If Torah learning was conducted before the prayer service, at the
end of which <em>Kaddish</em> <em>Al Yisrael</em> was recited, it is unnecessary to recite Half-<em>Kaddish </em>as well, so as to avoid saying too many    <em>Kaddishim</em> (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 236:1).
</p>
<p>
    By reciting <em>Barchu</em> we introduce <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, and therefore it is forbidden to talk after <em>Barchu</em>, similar to the law
    concerning someone who is in the middle of a passage of the <em>Shema</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 236:1; 54:14; see earlier in this book 16:4).
    Therefore, whoever did not succeed in saying <em>V'Hu Rachum</em> before <em>Barchu</em> does not recite it after <em>Barchu</em>, so as not to interrupt
    in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> (see <em>Yabia Omer</em> 2:5).
</p>
<p>
    The majority of <em>Sephardim</em> have the custom not to answer <em>Amen</em> after the <em>berachot</em> of the <em>chazan</em> to prevent interruption
    in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. It is best to finish the <em>berachah</em> with the <em>chazan</em> or slightly after him, so that according
to all opinions there will be no need to respond <em>Amen</em>. After <em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashkiveinu</em>, some answer <em>Amen</em> (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 236:6) and some do not (<em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Pekudei</em> 5). According to the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em>,    <em>Amen</em> is answered after the <em>chazan</em>'s blessings, and is not considered an interruption. However, even the <em>Ashkenazim</em> try not to
    answer <em>Amen</em> after <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ahavat Olam</em> so as not interrupt between the <em>berachah</em> and <em>Keriat Shema</em>, and they do
this by finishing the <em>berachah</em> together with the <em>chazan</em> or after him (see earlier in this book 16:4; all matters concerning    <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> are clarified in chapter 16).
</p>
<p>
    At the end of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashkiveinu</em>, <em>Sephardim</em> are accustomed to responding <em>Amen</em> to their own blessing, since it is a
    conclusion of a series of <em>berachot</em>. However, <em>Ashkenazim</em> do not answer <em>Amen</em> to their own <em>berachot</em>,<em> </em>with one
    exception, following <em>Birkat</em> <em>Boneh Yerushalayim</em> in <em>Birkat Hamazon</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 215:1; 236:4).
</p>
<p>
Between <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, the <em>chazan</em> recites Half-<em>Kaddish</em>, and after the <em>Amidah</em> he says    <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>. After that, according to the<em> </em>Sephardic <em>minhag</em>,<em> Shir HaMa'alot Esa Einai</em> is recited, following which
those in mourning recite Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em>, one of whom says <em>Barchu</em>. Subsequently, <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> is recited and there is no    <em>Kaddish</em> said after it. According to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, immediately after <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>,<em> Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> is
    recited, followed by the recital of the Mourner's <em>Kaddish</em> by the mourners, one of whom says <em>Barchu</em>.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Adjoining Redemption to Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    The main part of the Exodus occurred during the day, when the Jewish people left Egypt. Therefore, the primary obligation of adjoining redemption to prayer
    is in <em>Shacharit</em>. Nevertheless, because the redemption began at night, there is also a mitzvah to adjoin redemption to prayer at night. Yet, we are
not as meticulous in adjoining redemption to prayer in <em>Ma'ariv</em> as we are in <em>Shacharit</em>. Therefore, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted<em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashkiveinu</em> after <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> and considered it a continuation of <em>Birkat</em><em>Ga'al Yisrael</em>, for in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> the blessing concerns the redemption of all Jews as a collective whole, while in    <em>Hashkiveinu</em> we request the redemption of the individual from the dangers of the night. Were we to be strict about adjoining redemption to prayer,
    it would be impossible to say <em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashkiveinu</em> after the blessing regarding the redemption.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited between <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, for that is the order of the prayer; at every
transition point from one stage to another in the prayer service, <em>Chazal</em> established saying <em>Kaddish</em>. Although in <em>Shacharit</em>,    <em>Kaddish</em> is not recited immediately before the <em>Amidah</em> because of the great importance of not interrupting between redemption and prayer,
in<em> Ma'ariv</em>, in which there is no need to be as meticulous in adjoining redemption to prayer, <em>Kaddish</em> is recited between    <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>.
</p>
<p>
The custom in many places on <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> night is that the <em>gabbai</em> announces the words "<em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em>" before the    <em>Amidah</em> prayer, and on the night of the seventh of Cheshvan, when we begin to ask for rain, the <em>gabbai</em> declares, "<em>Tal U'Matar</em>."
    In <em>Shacharit</em>, we cannot interrupt with speech; instead, the <em>gabbai</em> or <em>chazan</em> reminds the congregation that there is something
different in this <em>Amidah</em> by pounding on the pulpit. Yet, in <em>Ma'ariv</em>, we are lenient and express this reminder verbally (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 236:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 7). Still, there are those who pound on the pulpit in <em>Ma'ariv</em> as well, so as not to
    interrupt with speech (see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 336:17; <em>Piskei Teshuvot </em>236:6).
</p>
<p>
    One who arrives late, when the congregation is about to start praying the <em>Amidah</em>, should recite the <em>Amidah</em> with the <em>minyan</em>, and
    then make up <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> afterwards. In <em>Shacharit</em>, the halachah is that he must recite the prayers in order because adjoining
    redemption to prayer is more important than praying in a <em>minyan</em>. However, in <em>Ma'ariv</em>, prayer in a <em>minyan</em> takes precedence, and
therefore he prays with the congregation and afterwards makes up <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 236:3).    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Time to Recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> Begins at <em>Tzeit HaKochavim</em>
</h2>
<p>
The time to recite the evening <em>Keriat Shema</em> is "when you lie down" - when people lie on their beds to sleep, which starts when it gets dark. The    <em>Chachamim</em> established a sign for the beginning of this time, when three medium-sized stars can be seen in the sky. This is because large stars are
    also visible during the day or at <em>bein hashemashot </em>(twilight). However, when three medium-size stars (according to the naked eye) emerge after
    them, it is a sign that night has begun (<em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> chapters 49-50). This time is called <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. To avoid error, and
to prevent mistaking big stars for medium ones, the <em>Rishonim</em> write that one must wait until he sees three small stars appear in the sky (    <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:1).
</p>
<p>
    However, here an uncertainty arises: how do we establish the time of <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>? Some say that the time of <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> is
    established according to those with good eyesight, and who know where the first stars are located. They can see the three medium stars approximately
    eighteen minutes after sunset, and sometimes even fifteen minutes after sunset. This is also implied from the Talmud (<em>Shabbat</em> 35b), which states
    that the time between sunset and <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> is the walking distance of three-quarters of a <em>mil</em>, which is approximately between
    thirteen-and-a-half minutes to eighteen minutes. Others say that it is established according to the majority of people, for most people discern three
medium stars approximately 25 to 30 minutes after sunset. All this is said in reference to medium stars. However, as mentioned previously, the    <em>Rishonim</em> write to wait until three small stars are visible; therefore, it is necessary to wait another few minutes.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, many are accustomed to start praying <em>Ma'ariv</em> approximately 20 minutes after sunset, for that is the halachah according to the
majority of <em>poskim</em>. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, it is best to start <em>Ma'ariv </em>approximately 30 minutes after sunset. One who prays in a<em>minyan</em> in which <em>Keriat Shema</em> was recited before 30 minutes passed from sunset, should go back and repeat the first paragraph of    <em>Shema</em> after <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em> in order to avoid uncertainty. Those who wish to be stringent say <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em> as well.
    There are those who also add <em>Vayomer.</em><button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>

<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The Time of the <em>Amidah</em> According to the <em>Chachamim</em> and Rabbi Yehudah
</h2>
<p>
    The time of the <em>Ma'ariv </em>prayer was established to correspond to the offering of the organs and fats of the <em>Tamid</em> offering upon the altar.
As we already learned (earlier in this book 24:7), the <em>Chachamim</em> and Rabbi Yehudah disagree regarding this matter. According to the    <em>Chachamim</em>, the time of <em>Minchah</em> is until night, and the time to pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>starts from <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. According to
    Rabbi Yehudah, the time of <em>Minchah</em> ends at <em>plag haminchah</em>, an hour and a quarter before the end of the day, and immediately after that
    begins the time of <em>Ma'ariv</em>. A person is permitted to choose whether to practice according to the <em>Chachamim</em> or Rabbi Yehudah, on condition
    that he adheres to one <em>minhag</em>. If he follows Rabbi Yehudah, he must make sure not to pray <em>Minchah</em> after <em>plag haminchah</em>. If he
    follows the <em>Chachamim</em>, he must make sure to pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. However, if a person prays <em>Minchah</em>
    after <em>plag haminchah</em> in the opinion of the <em>Chachamim</em>, it is forbidden to pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> according
    to Rabbi Yehudah.
</p>
<p>
Even though according to Rabbi Yehudah the time to recite <em>Ma'ariv </em>and <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> starts at <em>plag haminchah</em>, the time of    <em>Keriat Shema</em> itself does not begin until<em> tzeit hakochavim</em>. Therefore, a person praying before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> must repeat the
    three paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:1).<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
    , one may not switch from one ruling to another; instead, everyone must always practice according to one opinion. The prevalent <em>minhag</em> today is to
    follow the <em>Chachamim</em>. However, in times of need, a person is permitted to change from the <em>Chachamim</em>'s opinion and practice like Rabbi
    Yehudah. For instance, in the summer, when Shabbat starts late, there are those who wish to accept Shabbat early so that their small children can
    participate in the prayer service and the meal, and for that reason they pray <em>Ma'ariv</em> like Rabbi Yehudah, before sunset. Similarly, a person who
    finds himself in a place in which they practice like Rabbi Yehudah, even though he is used to praying <em>Ma'ariv</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, it
is better that he pray in a <em>minyan</em> like Rabbi Yehudah, instead of observing his <em>minhag</em> and praying individually like the    <em>Chachamim</em>.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. The <em>B'dieved</em> Custom Linking <em>Minchah</em> to <em>Ma'ariv</em> Before Its Proper Time
</h2>
<p>
    In some congregations, it was customary to pray <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em>,<em> </em>one right after the other, between <em>plag haminchah</em>
and <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. During the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, this custom was practiced primarily in Ashkenaz, and in the time of the    <em>Acharonim</em>, mainly in Spain. Many prominent rabbis questioned this <em>minhag</em> and attempted to abolish it, for it is a custom which
contradicts itself; since they prayed <em>Minchah</em> after <em>plag haminchah</em> like the opinion of the <em>Chachamim</em>, it is impossible to pray    <em>Ma'ariv </em>at that time like Rabbi Yehudah. Hence, it is proper to arrange Torah learning between <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em>, and in that
    way, the people praying will merit to learn Torah and to fulfill the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer in its proper time.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, the <em>Acharonim</em> instruct that if waiting until after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> will cause the people to disperse and the    <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer to be cancelled, it is possible to be lenient and recite <em>Ma'ariv</em> immediately after <em>Minchah</em>. Of course, all those
    praying must repeat <em>Keriat Shema</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Concerning an individual who normally prays according to the <em>Chachamim</em>'s approach, namely, <em>Ma'ariv</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, and
    finds himself in a place in which they observe the <em>minhag</em> of extenuating circumstances - <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> one right after the
other before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> - there is disagreement. Some say that it is preferable that the individual prays with them, so that he prays in a<em>minyan</em>. Others say that it is better that he preserves his <em>minhag</em>, prays <em>Minchah</em> with them in the <em>minyan</em>, but prays    <em>Ma'ariv</em> individually after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>

    8. The Final Time to Recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Ma'ariv</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Biblically, the time of the <em>Keriat Shema</em> of <em>Ma'ariv</em> lasts the whole night, for it is written, "<em>beshochbecha</em>," "when you lie
    down," and people normally lie on their beds throughout the entire night. However, the <em>Chachamim</em> "created a fence" to this law and established its
    time until <em>chatzot</em> (halachic midnight), so that a person won't postpone<em> </em>the recital of<em> Keriat Shema</em>, then fall asleep and miss
it. Nevertheless, <em>b'dieved</em>, if the time passed, and he did not recite it before <em>chatzot</em>, he says it with its <em>berachot</em> before    <em>amud hashachar </em>(dawn), since biblically, the time to recite it lasts the whole night.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
A person who found himself in circumstances beyond his control and did not recite <em>Shema</em> before <em>amud hashachar</em> has until    <em>netz hachamah</em> (sunrise) to do so (these times are clarified earlier in this book 11:2). When reciting <em>Shema</em> after <em>amud hashachar</em>
    , it is said with three <em>berachot</em>, though without <em>Birkat</em> <em>Hashkiveinu</em>, for since <em>amud hashachar</em> already arrived, it is no
    longer considered time "to lie down." <em>Ma'ariv</em> may not be prayed after <em>amud hashachar</em> either, because it was instituted for the night, and
after the break of dawn, daytime has already begun (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:34; <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 41).    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
, it is preferable to recite <em>Shema</em> and pray <em>Ma'ariv</em> immediately after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, for those who are expeditious perform    <em>mitzvot</em> early. However, someone who is engrossed in Torah study is permitted <em>l'chatchilah</em> to delay his prayer until after his learning,
as is done in many <em>yeshivot</em> where it is customary to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em> at the end of the afternoon learning session and not immediately at    <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. Similarly, a person who prefers to pray in a late <em>minyan</em> because he believes he will be able to concentrate better is
    permitted <em>l'chatchilah</em> to delay his prayer. Obviously it is better to pray in a late <em>minyan</em> rather than to pray individually immediately
    after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. Forbidden Activities Prior to Praying <em>Ma'ariv</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is forbidden to start eating, even a light meal, half an hour before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, for perhaps one will continue his meal until he becomes
    tired and falls asleep. It is also forbidden to drink alcoholic beverages. However, fruits and vegetables may be eaten. Even the consumption of bread or
    grains in an amount less than a <em>kabeitzah</em> is permissible.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button> If a person began eating before half
    an hour prior to <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, since he started to eat when he was permitted to do so, he may continue, provided that he will have enough time
    after his meal to recite <em>Shema</em> and pray (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:21).
</p>
<p>
    If a person began to eat when it was forbidden to do so, he must stop his meal in order to recite <em>Shema</em>, which is a biblical commandment. However,
    with regard to <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, since they are rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em>, he is permitted to delay their recital until
    after he finishes eating (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:2).
</p>
<p>
    If he asks a friend who is not eating to remind him afterwards to recite <em>Shema</em> and recite the <em>Amidah</em>, he is permitted to begin eating
    even after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> in times of need (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:18). If two people need to eat and did not yet pray <em>Ma'ariv</em>,
    in times of need they may make an agreement between themselves that they will remind each other to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em>, and in that way, there is no
concern that they will forget (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> in the introduction of section 669). Likewise, a person who always prays in a certain    <em>minyan</em> at a particular time, and knows that he will not forget to pray because the consistency of the <em>minyan</em> serves as his reminder, is
    permitted in extenuating circumstances to eat before <em>Ma'ariv</em> (see <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 232:16).
</p>
<p>
    In many <em>yeshivot</em> in the summer, dinner is started within the half-hour before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, and they rely on the fact that the time
    of prayer is set and known to all, and that everyone reminds each other to pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>after the meal. Although <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is
    proper to pray before dinner, nevertheless, it is correct to practice the way many <em>yeshivot</em> do in order to preserve the order of the learning
    sessions. If the meal is delayed until after praying <em>Ma'ariv</em>, the afternoon learning session will be too long and the evening learning too short,
    and it will likely cause neglect of Torah study.
</p>
<p>
    One who must eat before praying and has neither a permanent time to pray nor someone to remind him, may create a reminder to pray. For example, he can set
an alarm clock to ring, or he can ask his friend to call him and remind him to pray, and the minute he hears the ring or his friend's call, he must recite    <em>Shema</em> and pray (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2:12). <em>B'dieved</em>, he can tie something to his clothing, so that he cannot take off his clothes
    before going to sleep without noticing the reminder to recite <em>Shema</em> and pray.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, it is forbidden to sleep a regular sleep starting half an hour before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. In extenuating circumstances, in the beginning
of the evening, when everyone is normally still awake, a person may go to sleep after appointing someone to wake him up before the time to pray (see    <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 232:17).
</p>
<p>
A person who intends to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em> individually may not begin learning after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> without praying first. However, before    <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, he may start learning even if he intends to continue learning through <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. If he is accustomed to going to
    pray in a synagogue in a particular <em>minyan</em> that begins later, he is permitted to start learning in his house after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> for
    there is no concern that he will forget his regular schedule (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:5; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:30-31; 235:17).
</p>
<p>
    Some say that all activities prohibited by the <em>Chachamim</em> before <em>Minchah</em> are also forbidden before <em>Ma'ariv</em>, such as a task that
    will likely last a long time (<em>Rashba</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:17). Others say that the <em>Chachamim</em> only prohibited starting those
    types of work before <em>Minchah</em>, because a person is used to working in the afternoon and can get so involved in what he is doing that he will forget
    to pray. However, in the evening, people do not usually get caught up in their work (<em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 235:16, as implied from the <em>Rambam</em>
    and other <em>Rishonim</em>). <em>L'chatchilah</em>, in a situation in which there is concern that he will be tempted to continue working, it is proper to
    act stringently (see earlier in this book 24:5).

            In <em>Berachot</em> 27b, according to Rabban Gamliel the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer is obligatory, whereas according to Rabbi Yehoshua it is
optional. According to Abayei it is obligatory, whereas according to Rava it is optional, and the halachah follows Rava. The majority of            <em>Rishonim</em>, among them <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, and the <em>Rosh</em> (chapter 4, 2:7), maintain that "optional"
            (<em>reshut</em>) here means that, indeed, there is a mitzvah to recite <em>Ma'ariv</em>, and it may not be cancelled without justification, though
            it may be cancelled for a minor reason, as I have written above. By contrast, according to <em>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</em>, the word "optional"
            means that a person is permitted to abstain from praying <em>Ma'ariv</em> for no specific reason, although he maintains that if one customarily
            prays <em>Ma'ariv</em>, his <em>minhag</em> obligates him to pray daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Rif</em> writes that today, there is an obligation to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em>. The <em>Rosh</em> and <em>Tur</em> section 235 write this as
well. In <em>Seder</em> <em>Rav Amram Gaon</em>, he writes that Half-<em>Kaddish</em> is recited between <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and the<em>Amidah</em>, so as to separate between the obligatory and the optional sections. Even though, today, the prayer is obligatory, the<em>minhag</em> to recite <em>Kaddish</em> remains, in keeping with the essence of the original enactment. The opinions are summarized in            <em>Beirur Halachah</em> <em>Berachot</em> 4b.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most <em>poskim</em> say that someone who begins praying <em>Ma'ariv </em>and remembers in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em> that he already prayed
            must stop praying immediately, like the law regarding <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>, for indeed, everything that he prayed was to fulfill
            his obligation, but when it is clear that he already fulfilled it, he must stop (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 107:1, s.v. "<em>Posek</em>," and
            according to many, that is also what is implied from the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> there). However, according to the <em>Rambam</em> (10:6), he
            should continue his <em>Amidah</em> as a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>). The reason for this is that even nowadays <em>Ma'ariv </em>
is, in essence, optional, therefore the<em> </em>basic element of<em> nedavah </em>within it<em> </em>remains (that is also how            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 236:11 rules). One who is uncertain as to whether or not he prayed <em>Shacharit</em> or <em>Minchah</em> must
            repeat his prayer, but regarding <em>Ma'ariv</em>, the <em>Acharonim</em> disagree. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 107:2 writes that one should pray
            and add something new in the <em>Amidah</em> (see earlier in this book 18:3). According to all opinions, one who forgot to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em>
must make it up after <em>Shacharit </em>(<em>tashlumim</em>), and similarly, one who mistakenly forgot to recite <em>Ya'aleh V'Yavo</em> in            <em>Ma'ariv</em> of <em>Chol HaMo'ed </em>must repeat the <em>Amidah</em> (see <em>Beirur Halachah</em> 27b).

            Although <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 111:12 writes that according to the Kabbalah, even in <em>Ma'ariv</em> it is forbidden to switch the order of the
            prayers in the service, nevertheless, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> rules like the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, as do<em> Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, p.
            661 and <em>Rabbi Chaim Palaggi</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
There is an old custom to recite <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yir'u Eineinu</em> after <em>Hashkiveinu</em>, for it contains eighteen verses; see            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 236:5 where he writes that its recital was instituted to replace the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. There are <em>Rishonim</em>
            who maintain that there was no authority to institute its recital after the time of the completion of the Talmud, and therefore it is not to be
recited (<em>Meiri</em>). Even so, many do have the custom to recite it. <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> write that the recital of            <em>Yir'u Eineinu</em> was instituted instead of the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer which is optional, and even after people accepted <em>Ma'ariv </em>as
an obligation, the custom to recite <em>Yir'u Eineinu</em> was not cancelled. There are <em>poskim</em> who prove from the custom of reciting<em>Yir'u Eineinu</em> that there is no need to adjoin redemption to prayer in <em>Ma'ariv</em>. That is also the opinion of<em>Rav Amram Gaon</em>. Hence, <em>Kaddish</em> is also recited after <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. Nevertheless, the <em>Ramban</em> and the            <em>Rashbam</em> did not recite <em>Yir'u Eineninu</em> or <em>Kaddish</em>, so as not to interrupt between redemption and prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Already from the end of the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, it had become customary not to recite <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yir'u Eineinu</em> in
Sephardic congregations, although there were <em>Ashkenazim</em> who still recited it. Nowadays, in Israel it is not customary to recite it (see<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 236:12 and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 7). However, <em>Kaddish</em> is recited by all. Although it is the opinion of many            <em>Rishonim</em> not to recite this <em>Kaddish</em>, so as not to interrupt the adjoining of redemption to prayer; nonetheless, all are
            accustomed to reciting it. The explanation of this is as I wrote above. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 236:8 writes that <em>Kaddish</em> is a sort of
redemption, so that the respect of Heaven will be revealed in the world, and therefore it is not considered as much of an interruption. See            <em>Beirur Halachah</em>,<em> Berachot</em> 4b.

            See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> chapters 47-51. See also <em>Peninei Halachah Shabbat</em> I, p. 52 and in the footnotes. In <em>Shabbat</em> 35
            the time of <em>bein hashemashot </em>(twilight) is explained according to Rabbi Yehudah to be the amount of time it takes to walk three-quarters
            of a <em>mil</em>, and according to Rabbi Yossi, to be a short amount of time (approximately half a minute). The majority of <em>poskim </em>
            maintain that Rabbi Yossi's <em>bein hashemashot</em> is immediately after the time of Rabbi Yehudah's <em>bein hashemashot</em>. The halachah
            sides with both of them, meaning that from sunset until a little more than the time it takes to walk three-quarters of a <em>mil</em> is the time
            of <em>bein hashemashot</em>. (Some maintain that the <em>bein hashemashot</em> of Rabbi Yossi is a few minutes after the <em>bein hashemashot</em>
            of Rabbi Yehudah, as brought by <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 40:8-11, and then the time of <em>Ma'ariv</em> is later by a few more minutes.) As we
            learned earlier in chapter 11, note 1, there are three opinions regarding the amount of time a <em>mil</em> represents: 1) 18 minutes, 2) 22.5
            minutes, and 3) 24 minutes. Based on this, three-quarters of a <em>mil</em> is between 13.5 minutes and 18 minutes. In order to incorporate the
            time of Rabbi Yossi, a little more time must be supplemented, and the result according to this, is that the final time of <em>bein hashemashot</em>
            is between 14 and 19 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there are differences between the seasons of the year, for in Nisan (March 5<sup>th</sup>) and Tishrei (October 5<sup>th</sup>), the light
            fades faster after sunset and therefore it is possible to see three stars earlier. For instance, what can be seen in Nisan, 19 minutes after
            sunset, is visible at the peak of summer (June 22nd) almost 22 minutes after sunset, and at the height of winter, 21 minutes after sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also important to understand that one who stands high above sea level sees the sunset later. For example, one who stands on a mountain, or in
            a tower at a height of approximately 800 meters above sea level, will see the sunset about five minutes after his friend who stands at sea level
            below. In other words, the sky will darken at the same time for both of them and they will see the stars simultaneously, but if each of them were
            to calculate the amount of time that passed from sunset to <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, there would be a difference of approximately five minutes.
            Those who are higher see the sun for five more minutes. Based on this, if the <em>Chachamim</em> were talking about Jerusalem, whose height is
            approximately 800 meters above sea level (at places where the mountains do not block the horizon), in regard to this calculation, 14 or 19 minutes
            in Jerusalem is like 19 or 24 minutes at sea level. A few laws can be clarified after understanding this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Israel, on a straight horizon at sea level during the days of Nisan (March 5<sup>th</sup>) and Tishrei (October 5<sup>th</sup>), 14 minutes
            after sunset, the sun descends only 3.75 degrees below the horizon. This approach poses difficulty, for at that time, few, save the most skilled,
            rarely succeed in seeing three stars. See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 41:7 for explanations given by the <em>Acharonim</em>. Some say that
            perhaps the halachah is based on people with better vision, and others argue that maybe people living at that time had superior eyesight. As
            aforementioned, it is possible to conclude that the <em>Chachamim</em> were talking about Jerusalem, at a place where the hills do not block the
            horizon, and then the sunset is five minutes later, and it turns out that 14 minutes after sunset in Jerusalem is like 19 minutes after sunset in
            the <em>Shefelah</em> (the lowlands region of Israel).
        </p>
        <p>
            Indeed, according to those who maintain that <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> is 19 minutes after sunset in the <em>Shefelah</em>, the sun descends at
            that time 4.8 degrees below the horizon, and then experts who know where the first stars should be seen in the sky can see three medium-sized stars
            in the days of Nisan. However, in the summer days, one must wait 22 minutes for that same situation to arise, and in the winter, 21 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some say that three medium stars are actually only visible when the sun descends approximately 6.2 degrees below the horizon, which is 25.5 minutes
after sunset during Nisan, 28 minutes at the height of winter (December 22<sup>nd</sup>), and 29.5 minutes at the height of summer (June 22<sup>nd</sup>). At that time, most people see three medium-sized stars. Perhaps it somewhat resembles the opinion which maintains that            <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> is 19 minutes after sunset in Jerusalem, and at sea level it comes out to approximately 24 minutes after sunset (maybe
            another minute and a half were added since today eyesight has weakened, or because the abundance of electric lights make it more difficult to see
            the stars, although perhaps it is truly possible to see the stars slightly before that).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are those who are more stringent and maintain that in actuality, most people do not see three stars before the sun descends 7.1 degrees below
            the horizon, which is around 30 minutes after sunset during Nisan and Tishrei at sea level, and in the summer, approximately 35 minutes. This is
            what has been said in the name of the <em>Chazon Ish</em>. However, it is difficult to explain the words of these stringent <em>poskim</em>
            according to the <em>Gemara</em> who allotted that the time it takes to walk three-quarters of a <em>mil</em> to <em>bein hashemashot</em>.
Additionally, concerning calculations made in open areas in which there are no lights and electricity, people saw three stars before then. See            <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 47:12; 50:6-7. The additional aspects of this issue require further examination. For example, in Tishrei, even though
            the duration of the darkening of the skies is similar to Nisan, we see the stars slightly later due to the position of the stars in the skies; and
            the question is, do we go by the stars or according to the darkness? See <em>Hazemanim BaHalachah</em>, chapter 48.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the aforementioned refers to the time of three medium stars. However, so that people will not come to err, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules
            that they must wait until three small stars emerge, meaning, another few minutes. Some say that nowadays, since we use clocks, there is no need to
wait. See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 51, note 3. Nevertheless, even according to those who are stringent <em>l'chatchilah</em>, if one recited            <em>Shema</em> after three medium-sized stars emerged, <em>b'dieved</em> he fulfilled his obligation.
        </p>
        <p>
In practice, the prevalent <em>minhag</em> is to start <em>Ma'ariv</em> 20 minutes after sunset, and this is good according to the majority of            <em>poskim</em>, as written in many halachic works. At that time, in all places, experts can see three stars, which is when the sun is at 4.8
            degrees below the horizon. (Even in the <em>Shefelah</em> in the summer, when the congregation reaches <em>Shema</em>, 22 minutes will have
            passed.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it is possible to rely on the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> and recite <em>Shema</em> 20 minutes after sunset, it is better
            to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> 30 minutes after sunset. If one recites it before then, it is best that he repeats it after praying, although it is
            not unnecessary to say the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph. Despite the fact that according to the <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em>, remembering the Exodus must
            also be at the proper time for <em>Keriat Shema</em>, nonetheless, according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, it is permissible to mention it before
            then, at the proper time for <em>Ma'ariv</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:11). Therefore, when a person recited <em>Shema</em> after 18 minutes
            following sunset, he need not repeat <em>Vayomer</em>. It is not even so crucial to repeat <em>V'Hayah Im Shamo'a</em> since, according to the
            majority of <em>poskim</em>, the obligation to recite it is rabbinic.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>L'chatchilah</em>
            , so as to take into consideration those <em>poskim </em>who are stringent, it is good to set the time of <em>Ma'ariv</em> 30 minutes after sunset.
            That way, people living in the hills also fulfill their obligation throughout the whole year even according to the stringent opinions (the sun is
            7.1 degrees below the horizon), and those in the <em>Shefelah</em> fulfill their obligation the whole year round, according to most opinions (6.2
            degrees below the horizon), and most of the year they fulfill their obligation even according to those who are stringent. In order to always
            fulfill one's obligation in the <em>Shefelah</em> also according to the stringent opinions, it is necessary to delay the recital of <em>Barchu</em>
            during the summer by another three minutes so that when the congregation arrives at <em>Keriat Shema</em>, 35 minutes will already have passed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The law concerning the emergence of three medium-sized stars is also significant with regard to establishing the time of a circumcision for a baby
            born at the beginning of Shabbat. If the baby is born after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, he must be circumcised on the following Shabbat; and if he
            is born at <em>bein hashemashot</em>, it is forbidden to circumcise him on Shabbat, and his circumcision is postponed until Sunday. The matter
            depends on the precise time of <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> is. The <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 7, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 41:8 rules that 20 minutes after
            sunset is certainly nighttime, and therefore the baby is circumcised on Shabbat. <em>Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah</em>, part 2, 46:45 writes in the
            name of <em>Rav Auerbach</em> that night begins definitively 25 minutes after sunset. However, the fact that neither opinion makes a distinction
            between Jerusalem and the <em>Shefelah</em>, and between the different seasons of the year is problematic. The book <em>Otzar HaBrit</em> 9, 5, 7,
            mentions that there are those who maintain that nighttime officially starts at 24 minutes after sunset, and some say 28 minutes, but that the
author himself was taught that it is no less than 32 minutes after sunset. Still, he too, neglects to distinguish between Jerusalem and the            <em>Shefelah</em> and the different seasons of the year. It seems best to follow the approach that says that night begins when the sun is 6.2
            degrees below the horizon. In Jerusalem that is approximately 20.5-24.5 minutes after sunset, and in the <em>Shefelah</em>, 25.5-29.5 minutes after
            sunset. It is possible to calculate the exact time with the help of the computer program <em>Chazon Shamayim</em>, based on the secular date, the
            place of birth of the child according to the lines of longitude and latitude, and the altitude of the location.

However, the <em>Tosafot </em>write in<em> Berachot</em> 2a that according to <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, the time to recite the evening            <em>Keriat Shema</em> is the same as the time of <em>Ma'ariv</em>, and according to Rabbi Yehudah, one is permitted to fulfill his obligation from
            the time of <em>plag haminchah</em>. According to <em>Rabbeinu Yitzchak</em>,<em> </em>it is permissible in extenuating circumstances to be lenient
            regarding the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and to follow the opinions which say that it is a few minutes before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>.
            Nonetheless, the remaining <em>Rishonim</em> maintain that the time to recite the evening <em>Keriat Shema</em> is after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>,
            and therefore it is necessary to repeat <em>Keriat Shema</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, as the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:1 rules. There is
disagreement as to whether it is necessary to repeat the <em>Vayomer</em> paragraph after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> as well. According to the            <em>Magen Avraham</em>, the time to remember the Exodus from Egypt is the same as the time of <em>Ma'ariv</em> and one need not make it up, whereas
            according to the <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em> its time is like the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and one must make it up (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            235:11). Regarding <em>Birkot</em> <em>Keriat Shema</em>, in principal their time is like the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em>. However, in practice,
those who follow Rabbi Yehudah normally recite them before <em>tzeit hakochavim </em>and fulfill their obligation, as clarified in the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:7 and 11, and <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 6.

            According to the <em>Ra'ah</em> and <em>Meiri</em>, throughout the day a person must practice according to one approach, but each day he may choose
            a different <em>minhag</em>. According to <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Rashba</em>, and the <em>Rosh</em>, one must always choose to
            follow one opinion and he is not allowed to switch approaches even from time to time. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 233:1, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            6:11 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 9:12 rule that, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, alternating approaches is prohibited, but in times of need, one is permitted
            to do so (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 267:3).

The <em>Tosafot Berachot</em> 2a, <em>Rosh</em>, and <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, as well as other <em>Rishonim</em>, question this            <em>minhag</em> of praying <em>Ma'ariv </em>before sunset, for it involves two lenient opinions which contradict each other. In practice, to
accommodate the needs of the multitude, they ruled leniently, as written in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 233:11, <em>Kaf Hachaim</em> 12, and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 3, 235:1. However, all agree that <em>Keriat Shema</em> must be recited after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. There are two
            main opinions concerning the proper conduct in a place where the congregation is praying <em>Ma'ariv</em> before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. There
are two main opinions concerning how one must practice when in a place in which the congregation is praying <em>Ma'ariv</em> before            <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. According to the <em>Rambam</em>, he recites <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> with them and adjoins redemption to prayer,
and after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> he goes back and recites <em>Keriat Shema</em> in order to fulfill the mitzvah. That is how the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:1 rules. According to <em>Rav Hai Gaon</em>, he only recites <em>Keriat Shema</em> with the congregation so that from<em>Shema</em> he will begin the <em>Amidah</em> together with the <em>minyan</em>. However, <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, as well as            <em>Keriat Shema</em> itself (in which he will fulfill his obligation), are recited after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. From his opinion it appears
            that it is better to recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> with <em>Keriat Shema</em>, after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>, even though in so doing one
does not adjoin redemption to prayer. This is what the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:12 writes and that is how he himself practiced (see<em>Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim</em> 2:60). According to the <em>Gra</em>, it is always preferable to pray <em>Ma'ariv</em> individually after            <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> like the <em>Chachamim</em> rather than to pray with the congregation before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> like Rabbi
            Yehudah.

In a place in which <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> are prayed one right after the other, it is better, if possible, to be careful to recite            <em>Minchah</em> before sunset and <em>Ma'ariv </em>after sunset, for some <em>poskim</em> maintain that <em>Ma'ariv </em>time begins at sunset,
            and that is how the <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 15:6, understands the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>. Even according to this opinion, the
time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> is after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. Nonetheless, the majority of <em>poskim</em> rule that the time of the            <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer according to the <em>Chachamim</em> is, indeed, after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>. That is what the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            233:9 writes.

            The first opinion is inferred from <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 233:12. One makes up the three paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> later. The second opinion can
            be inferred from <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 235:16. However, if one prayed <em>Minchah</em> before <em>plag haminchah</em> he prays <em>Ma'ariv</em>
            with the <em>minyan</em> and follows one of the two opinions mentioned in the previous note.

The <em>Mishnah</em> in <em>Berachot</em> 2a states that, according to the <em>Chachamim</em>, the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> lasts until            <em>chatzot</em>, and according to Rabban Gamliel, it is until <em>amud hashachar</em>. In the <em>Gemara</em> 8b, the conclusion is that the
            halachah follows Rabban Gamliel. That is also how the <em>Rosh</em> and <em>Rashba</em> rule, that it is permissible <em>l'chatchilah</em> to
recite <em>Shema</em> until <em>amud hashachar</em>. However, the opinion of the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Smag</em>, and the majority of            <em>Rishonim</em> is that its time is until <em>chatzot</em>, and only if the time passed and one did not recite it until then, he may recite it
            until <em>amud hashachar</em>. In such a case the <em>Gemara</em> teaches that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel (and perhaps that is the opinion
of Rabban Gamliel himself). That is how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:3 rules. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> supports this opinion. (Regarding the            <em>Chachamim</em>'s opinion, the <em>Rishonim</em> disagree: according to <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> maintain that
            one cannot recite <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> after <em>chatzot</em>, and according to the <em>Smag</em>, <em>b'dieved</em>, it can be recited
after <em>chatzot</em>. The <em>Gra</em> explains that the <em>Bavli</em> and the <em>Yerushalmi</em> are divided concerning this. According to the<em>Bavli</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> maintain that <em>b'dieved</em> one may recite <em>Shema</em> after <em>chatzot</em>, and according to the            <em>Yerushalmi</em>, one may not. Additionally, see <em>Beirur Halachah Berachot</em> 2a.)

            <strong>The time of the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Ma'ariv</em>:</strong>
according to the <em>Derech HaChaim</em>,<em> l'chatchilah</em>, lasts until <em>chatzot</em>, and according to the <em>Pri Megadim</em>,            <em> lechatchilah</em>, it is all night. These opinions are cited by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 108:15. (See earlier in this book, chapter 17,
            note 13, concerning the matter of someone who is traveling and finishes his trip after <em>chatzot</em>.) <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 15:9, writes
            that it is preferable to pray individually before <em>chatzot</em> rather than in a <em>minyan</em> after <em>chatzot</em>.

            If, because of circumstances beyond his control, one recites the <em>Ma'ariv Shema</em> after <em>amud hashachar</em>, he cannot fulfill his
            obligation of the daytime <em>Shema</em> before <em>netz</em> that same day, for after treating this time as a time to lie down, he cannot consider
it also a time to get up (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:5; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 22). However, there are those who say that after the time of            <em>misheyakir</em> he may recite the<em> Shema</em> of <em>Shacharit </em>(<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 58:21).
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:30 explains that, biblically, it is permissible to recite the <em>Keriat Shema</em> of <em>Ma'ariv</em> until<em>netz</em>; since at that time there are still people lying in their beds, it is called a time of "when you lie down." However, at<em>amud hashachar</em>, the day already begins, and therefore the <em>Chachamim</em> established not to recite the <em>Shema</em> of            <em>Ma'ariv </em>after <em>amud hashachar</em>. Only someone who did not recite the <em>Shema</em> before <em>amud hashachar</em> due to
            circumstances beyond his control is permitted to recite it until <em>netz</em>. <em>Rav Kook</em> in <em>Tov Ro'i</em> 55 clarifies that,
            biblically, the time for the nighttime <em>Keriat Shema</em> is until <em>amud hashachar</em> and the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted that one who
            finds himself in circumstances beyond his control can make it up until <em>netz</em>.

The basis for the enhancement to be expeditious can be found in the words of <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> and is brought by the            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 235:3 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 26. However, other <em>Rishonim</em> do not mention this enhancement, and according to
the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 235:18, there are even those who disagree with it. Therefore, many are not strict to pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>early. See            <em>Beit Baruch</em> 34:17.

            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
            235:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 235:16; 232:35. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 232:34 explains that it is even permissible to eat cooked food made
            from grain if one does not intend to become full from it. From this we can learn that if he intends to become full from fruits and vegetables or
from food made from legumes, indeed, it is considered a meal that is forbidden before reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> and praying the            <em>Amidah</em>.
