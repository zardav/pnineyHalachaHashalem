    Chapter Two: The <em>Minyan</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Virtue of a <em>Minyan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    When ten Jews are engaged in Torah or prayer, the Shechinah dwells among them, as it says (Psalms 82:1), "God is present in a Godly congregation." Although
    the <em>Shechinah</em> dwells even with one Jew who prays or learns individually, nevertheless, different levels exist. The highest level is when ten Jews
    are engaged in a matter of sanctity<em> </em>(<em>davar shebikedushah</em>), for then holiness is revealed to the world (see <em>Berachot</em> 6a). Based
    on this, the <em>Chachamim</em> established that all matters of sanctity be recited in a <em>minyan</em>. These include: <em>Chazarat</em> <em>HaShatz</em>
(the repetition of the <em>Amidah</em>), <em>Birkat Kohanim </em>(the priestly blessing), <em>Barchu</em>, <em>Kaddish</em>, and the Torah reading (    <em>Megillah</em> 23b).<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    The<em> Chachamim</em> state that a prayer recited together with the congregation (<em>b'tzibur</em>) is accepted, as is written (Psalms 55:19), "He
redeems me unharmed from the battle against me, for those with me are many." Even when a congregation prays without full <em>kavanah</em>,    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> does not turn away from the prayers of the many (<em>Berachot</em> 8a). Although any prayer recited amongst ten Jews is more
    meaningful and accepted, the essence of communal prayer is ten Jews jointly praying the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, also known as the <em>Amidah</em>.
</p>
<p>
Hence, praying in a <em>minyan</em> provides two benefits: first, in a <em>minyan</em> one may recite all those matters of sanctity that the    <em>Chachamim</em> instituted; second, communal prayer is accepted on the merit of the congregation<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Since the <em>Shechinah</em> dwells in the midst of a <em>minyan</em>, every person should try to be one of the first ten people to arrive for prayer. If a
person cannot be one of the first ten people to arrive for <em>Shacharit</em>, he should try to be one of the first for <em>Minchah</em> or    <em>Ma'ariv</em> (<em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em>, 90:14; <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Miketz</em> 1).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. The Virtue of Prayer in a <em>Minyan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Upon first glance, one might think that prayer recited individually is more intense and passionate and better expresses one's particular character and
    needs. However, despite the importance of the individual experience, our main objective in this world is to sanctify God's Name and to connect all the
    components of the world to their spiritual root. That is why we need to work from within and on behalf of the collective whole. This sense of unity and
    belonging is also expressed by praying in a <em>minyan</em>. Similarly, in the wording of the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, we make requests on behalf of
everyone: "Heal <strong>us</strong> and <strong>we</strong> will be healed," "Bless this year for <strong>us</strong>," "Sound a great <em>shofar</em> for    <strong>our</strong> freedom and raise a banner to gather <strong>our</strong> exiles," "And to Jerusalem Your city, may You return in mercy," and so too
    for the remaining <em>berachot</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Am Yisrael</em>
    's uniqueness lies in its ability to reveal <em>kedushah</em> (holiness) within the collective whole. Prominent righteous people exist among the gentile
    nations, but their holiness is limited to their individual lives.<em> Kedushah</em> in a national format is revealed solely through <em>Am Yisrael. </em>
    Therefore <em>Am Yisrael</em> received the Torah, and it is the nation that can build the Temple, through which the Divine light is revealed to this world.
    Even ten Jews who gather together for matters of sanctity manifest, to a certain extent, the holiness of the Jewish people. <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, if a person who prays in a <em>minyan</em>, connects to the congregation, identifies with its grief and pleads for its well-being, and wants to
    add personal prayers from his heart, it is indeed praiseworthy, since all of his personal prayers are connected to the collective whole.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. What Is Prayer in a <em>Minyan</em>?
</h2>
<p>
The essence of prayer in a <em>minyan</em> is praying <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> together with ten Jews. One who does not succeed in praying    <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> together with the congregation should pray with the <em>chazan</em> when he repeats the <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>)
    since, according to most <em>poskim</em>, that is also regarded as prayer recited in a <em>minyan</em>.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, if a person arrives late to synagogue and recites the <em>Amidah</em> while the congregation is still reciting other parts of the prayer
    service, such as <em>Aleinu Leshabe'ach</em>, although he is not considered praying in a <em>minyan</em>, he does derive some merit, since he is praying in
a holy place where ten Jews are singing songs of praise. If he recites the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Shacharit</em> while the congregation is praying    <em>Musaf</em>, he is considered to be praying in a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Tzelach</em>, <em>Berachot</em> 6a; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:30).
</p>
<p>
    A person who is unable to attend synagogue should try to coordinate the time he prays with the time the congregation prays, thereby partially engaging
himself in the <em>minyan</em>'s prayer. This way, his prayer will be accepted, since the time the congregation prays is a favorable time (    <em>Berachot</em> 8a; <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 90:9). <em>Lechatchilah</em>, he should try to synchronize his prayer with the prayers of a specific
congregation whose schedule he knows. If he does not know when a particular congregation is praying, he should have in mind to pray with any<em>minyan</em>, for surely any time he prays there is a <em>minyan</em> somewhere in the world that is standing in prayer.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. The Extent of One's Obligation to Pray in a <em>Minyan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is a rabbinic mitzvah (<em>mitzvah mi'drabbanan</em>) to pray in a <em>minyan</em>. The <em>Chachamim</em> obligate a person to make an effort to walk
    to a <em>minyan</em>, even if it is far from his house, approximately the walking distance of a <em>mil</em> (960 meters or approximately .597 miles),
which takes about 18 minutes (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:52). If he is traveling, and within 72 minutes (approximately the time required to walk four<em>mil</em>s) will arrive at a place that has a <em>minyan</em>, even if he planned to stop to rest, he must continue traveling in order to pray in a    <em>minyan</em>. However, if the <em>minyan</em> is not on his way, he must only go out of his way up to a walking distance of 18 minutes in order to pray
    in a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:16).
</p>
<p>
    According to many <em>poskim</em>, whoever normally travels by car must, in order to pray, drive to a <em>minyan</em> as far as 18-minutes away. Similarly,
someone who is traveling by car and knows that within 72 minutes he will arrive at a place that has a <em>minyan</em>, must continue onward to that    <em>minyan</em> (see the note).<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    A person, who must urgently secure his business or property or otherwise suffer monetary loss, is permitted to pray individually in order to prevent
personal loss. However, businessmen and craftsmen must stop working in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, despite the fact that while they go to pray in a    <em>minyan</em> they cannot continue to work and make money. Only if a mishap occurs, which if they do not handle, will cause them to lose a great deal of
money, in that particular instance, they are permitted to pray individually (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:29).    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    A person who needs to travel in order to attend to urgent matters or for medical care and by praying in a <em>minyan</em> will not arrive at his desired
    destination on time, is permitted to pray individually, since otherwise he will suffer a loss.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. Priorities Pertaining to Prayer in a <em>Minyan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    A person who finds it difficult to have<em> kavanah </em>when praying in a congregation, but succeeds in retaining the basic <em>kavanah </em>with which he
    fulfills his obligation, must pray in a <em>minyan</em>, even if he concentrates better while praying individually. As long as he has <em>kavanah </em>for
    the first <em>berachah</em> of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, he must pray in a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 3, 7).
    Moreover, in the long-term, consistent praying with a congregation usually strengthens one's<em> kavanah </em>and connection to matters of sanctity.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>talmid chacham</em> (Torah scholar)<em> </em>whose learning is his profession, must try to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, even though the walk to
    synagogue to pray in a <em>minyan</em> causes him to lose time from his learning. Though, in principle, he is allowed to pray individually, he must be
    scrupulous to pray in a congregation, so that people will not learn from him to belittle the matter of communal prayer. Only on rare occasions, when he is
    in the middle of an important subject of study and the walk to a <em>minyan</em> will greatly disturb his learning, is he permitted to be lenient and pray
    individually (based on the <em>Rama</em> 90:18).
</p>
<p>
    With regard to one who teaches Torah to others and is unable to both pray in a <em>minyan</em> as well as teach his class, it is better that he pray
    individually and not cancel his class, for the communal learning of Torah overrides praying in a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah </em>90:56).
</p>
<p>
    It is preferable to pray with a congregation rather than take part in the meal of a <em>brit milah</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 90:67). However, in a case in
    which the host of the <em>seudah </em>(meal) is likely to be insulted if a particular person does not attend, it is better that he pray individually and
    participate in the <em>seudat mitzvah</em> in order to prevent a rift.
</p>
<p>
When a person has two options: to pray individually "<em>vatikin</em>" at sunrise (<em>netz</em>) or to pray in a <em>minyan</em> later, most<em>poskim</em> maintain that it is preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em> (see also further in this book 11:9).    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Who Can Be Counted in a <em>Minyan</em>?
</h2>
<p>
    A <em>minyan</em> is a gathering of ten male Jews of sound mind and responsibility to join together for matters of sanctity. A minor, who is not yet of
full sound mind and competence, does not count as part of the <em>minyan</em>. When he reaches the age at which he is obligated to fulfill the    <em>mitzvot</em> (bar mitzvah), he is counted as part of the <em>minyan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    There are some <em>Rishonim</em> who maintain that in extenuating circumstances (<em>b'sha'at hadchak</em>), nine adults may include a minor who is holding
    a <em>Chumash</em> in his hand as part of their <em>minyan</em>. However, in the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, even in extenuating circumstances, a
    minor may not be considered part of the <em>minyan</em>, and that is how we practice. Nevertheless, in a situation in which the <em>minyan</em> will be
canceled completely unless he is counted, possibly causing some of the members to distance themselves from Judaism, he can be counted as part of the    <em>minyan</em>.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, a <em>shoteh</em> (deranged person), who is not of sound mind - for example, one who takes off his clothes and ruins them - cannot be counted as
    part of a <em>minyan</em>. Regarding one who temporarily loses his sanity but afterwards returns to his senses, when he loses his sanity - he cannot be
    included as part of the <em>minyan</em> and when he regains his sanity - he may be counted (<em>Chagigah</em> 3b; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 55:8). Likewise,
    one who is drunk like Lot, and does not know what is being done to him, may not be included in a <em>minyan</em>. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, it is preferable
    not to count a drunken person who is incapable of speaking before the King as part of the <em>minyan</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:14; and see further in
    this book 5:11).
</p>
<p>
    Since a person who is deaf-mute does not have a way of communicating with the world, the <em>Chachamim</em> say that he is considered a <em>shoteh</em> and
he is exempt from fulfilling the <em>mitzvot</em>. Therefore, he may not be counted as part of the <em>minyan</em> (<em>Chagigah</em> 2b;    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 55:8). The <em>poskim</em> disagree as to whether or not the status of a deaf-mute person changes, if he was taught to communicate
with his surroundings, either by sign language or by reading and writing. Since joining a <em>minyan</em> is a rabbinic mitzvah, the halachah follows those    <em>poskim</em> who are lenient, and therefore he may be counted in a <em>minyan</em>.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Is a Person Praying the <em>Amidah</em> Counted as Part of the <em>Minyan</em>?
</h2>
<p>
    To comprise a <em>minyan</em>, it is not necessary for all ten men to be able to participate in saying the matters of sanctity. Even when a few of those
    participating cannot respond to the <em>chazan</em>, they still complete the <em>minyan</em>. For example, if a few of them have not yet finished reciting
    the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Ma'ariv</em>, even though they cannot respond to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em>, the <em>Shechinah</em> dwells among them
because there are ten Jews present. As a result, they are permitted to recite matters of sanctity. Likewise, a deaf person who does not hear the<em>chazan</em>, or a mute person who cannot respond, can each still complete a <em>minyan</em>. There must be at least five people present who answer the    <em>chazan</em>, since together with the <em>chazan</em>, they make up a majority.
</p>
<p>
In the opinion of some prominent <em>Acharonim</em>, the ruling that even one who cannot answer may be counted as part of the <em>minyan</em> refers to<em>Kaddish</em> and other matters of sanctity. However, regarding <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, it is necessary to have nine people who will actually answer<em>Amen</em> to the <em>chazan</em>, for without nine, his <em>berachot</em> will be in vain (<em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav </em>55:7; <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,    <em>Vayechi</em> 6). Nonetheless, according to many <em>poskim</em>, although <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is necessary that nine people answer <em>Amen</em>
    to <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, in principle, even those who do not answer <em>Amen</em> count, and the <em>chazan</em> may start <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>
    even before all nine have finished praying. Similarly, it is permitted to repeat the <em>Amidah</em> in a <em>minyan</em> in which people regularly engage
in idle chatter during <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, even if there might not be nine people answering <em>Amen</em> to the <em>berachot</em>, since    <em>b'dieved</em> even those who do not answer still count as part of the <em>minyan</em> (<em>Magen Avraham</em>; <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>).
</p>
<p>
In order to avoid uncertainty, in a place where many people chatter and there is concern that there will not be nine people answering <em>Amen</em> to the    <em>chazan</em> when he repeats the <em>Amidah</em>, the <em>chazan</em> should stipulate in his heart that if the ruling is according to those who
    maintain that nine people are needed to answer, then his <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> will be considered a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>). Since
a person is permitted to pray a voluntary prayer, according to all opinions his <em>berachot</em> will not be in vain (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124:19).    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. Counting a Non-Religious Jew as Part of the <em>Minyan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    A Jew who has sinned, for example, by eating forbidden foods, committing adultery, or transgressing other biblical commandments, is still counted as part
    of the <em>minyan</em>. Despite the fact that he sinned, in his inner core he surely desires to be a part of the holy objectives of <em>Am Yisrael</em>. As
    the <em>Chachamim</em> say (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 44a), "A Jew, even one who has sinned, is still a Jew." However, a person who sins in order to purposely
incite God's wrath does not count as part of a <em>minyan</em>, since he himself demonstrates that he does not belong to the Torah or to Israel (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:46-47).
</p>
<p>
    According to some <em>poskim</em>, one who desecrates the Shabbat in public, even if he does it for his own pleasure, is considered an idol worshiper and
    does not count as part of the <em>minyan</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:46). However, in recent generations, a few prominent <em>poskim</em> have taught
    that if a person who desecrates the Shabbat wants to be part of a <em>minyan</em>, we can include him. This is because today, the status of one who
    desecrates the Shabbat is different. In the past, when all of Israel observed the Shabbat, anyone who dared to publicly desecrate the Shabbat, even if he
    did it for his own pleasure, outwardly defied all of Israel and was therefore deemed as one who sins intentionally to arouse anger. However, in recent
    times, when unfortunately many Jews do not keep the Shabbat, its observance is not a measure of a Jew's identification with his heritage, and therefore, if
he himself wants to be part of the <em>minyan</em>, he may be counted. Still, it is not proper to appoint him as <em>chazan</em>.    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. How Is a Person Counted in a <em>Minyan</em>?
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, a <em>minyan</em> is a gathering of ten Jewish males who are of sound mind. In order for them to join as a <em>minyan</em>, they must
    be together in one place. If nine of them are in the synagogue and one is outside or in an adjacent room, they are not considered a <em>minyan</em>. If the
    person outside the synagogue is standing next to the door or window, and his face is visible, according to most <em>poskim</em> he can be counted as part
    of the <em>minyan</em>, because their eye contact unites them. It is not necessary for everyone to see him, rather it is sufficient for only some to see
    him. Nevertheless, there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that eye contact cannot be used to link a person to a <em>minyan</em>, and only if he inserts his
    head into the window will he be considered present with them and thus be counted in the <em>minyan</em>. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, we are to be stringent
    about this, but in extenuating circumstances, when he cannot come inside and join them, we may rely on most <em>poskim</em> who are lenient and count him
    as long as his face is visible.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p>
Someone whose face is not visible to those praying inside the synagogue, but is in the ancillary room of the synagogue, does not complete the<em>minyan</em>. Even so, if a <em>minyan</em> already exists without him, when he prays with them he is considered to be praying in a <em>minyan</em>.    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p>
    Ten people who are standing in a field, as long as they can see and hear one another, are considered a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 2:44).
</p>
<p>
    When there is a <em>minyan</em> of ten inside the synagogue, anyone who hears the <em>chazan</em> may respond. For instance, a sick person who is bedridden
    and hears the congregation's prayers from his house, though he is not regarded as one who is praying in a <em>minyan</em>, he may answer <em>Amen</em>,
    since<em> </em>not even a steel barrier can separate a Jew from the <em>Shechinah</em> that dwells with the <em>minyan</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    55:20). Similarly, if he hears the sound of the <em>shofar</em> blowing or the <em>megillah</em> reading from the synagogue, he can have<em> kavanah </em>
    to fulfill the mitzvah by hearing it.
</p>
<p>
    A person who hears a <em>chazan</em> via a live broadcast on the radio or television may answer <em>Amen</em> after him. However, he cannot fulfill his
    obligation by listening to the <em>megillah</em> reading on the radio or television, because he is not hearing the actual voice of the <em>chazan</em>
    himself.<button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p>
    In summary, there are four levels of joining together for matters of sanctity: 1. When a person is situated in the same place as the people praying or he
    is visible to them (according to most <em>poskim</em>) he can complete a <em>minyan</em>. 2. A person who is in the ancillary room of the synagogue but is
    not visible to the people praying cannot complete the <em>minyan</em>. If, however, there is a <em>minyan</em> without him, he is considered to be praying
    in a <em>minyan</em>. 3. One who is in a different room or outside the synagogue is not considered praying in a <em>minyan</em>, but may fulfill his
    obligation by hearing the <em>chazan</em>. 4. One who hears the <em>chazan</em> on the radio may answer <em>Amen</em>, but cannot fulfill his obligation by
    hearing him.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. A Diminished <em>Minyan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    When the recital of <em>Kaddish</em> in a <em>minyan</em> has begun, and a few men leave in the middle, if most of the <em>minyan</em> remains (at least
    six including the <em>chazan</em>) the <em>Kaddish</em> may be completed. This rule applies to all prayers that require a <em>minyan</em>; if they started
to pray with ten people and most of the <em>minyan</em> remained, they conclude the prayer that they started, but do not begin a new prayer (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 55:2). It is prohibited to walk out and disband the <em>minyan</em> in the middle of matters of sanctity. However, in situations in
    which it is necessary, one is permitted to leave before the start of the next part of the prayers.
</p>
<p>
    If a <em>minyan</em> began <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, and part of the <em>minyan</em> left but most remained, those remaining may say <em>Kedushah</em> and
conclude the repetition of the <em>Amidah</em>. However, they do not say <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> because it is a mitzvah by itself. Concerning    <em>Kaddish Titkabal</em> after the prayer service, the <em>poskim</em> are divided. The Sephardic custom is not to recite it since it is considered to be
    the start of a new prayer. According to the Ashkenazic custom it is considered to be the end of the prayer service because in it, we ask that our prayers
be accepted. Therefore, in <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em>, if there are ten men at the start of <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, they may recite<em>Kaddish Titkabal</em>. (In <em>Shacharit</em> they also recite the Half <em>Kaddish</em> before <em>Ashrei</em>.) In <em>Ma'ariv</em>, if there is a    <em>minyan</em> at the beginning of the silent <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and six men remain, they recite <em>Kaddish Titkabal</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    55:3; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> there).

            <em>Megillah</em>
            23b and <em>Masechet</em> <em>Sofrim</em> 10:7 list the sections of prayer that necessitate a <em>minyan</em> for their recital. The source for
            this is the verse, "I will be sanctified among the Israelites," meaning that holiness is revealed within a sect of Israel. The <em>Chachamim</em>
            teach that the Torah is referring to ten Jews. The laws of <em>kiddush Hashem</em> (the sanctification of God's Name) are learned from here,
            specifically concerning a person who is forced to desecrate Hashem's Name by sinning in public. If there are ten Jews present, he must refuse and
            sacrifice himself, but if ten Jews are not present, self-sacrifice is unnecessary. However, the <em>Ran</em>, as well as other <em>Rishonim</em>
            and <em>Acharonim</em>, write that the enactment of a <em>minyan</em> for matters of sanctity is a rabbinic ruling, for the obligation itself to
            recite these sections of prayer is rabbinic. Therefore, when there are doubts concerning rulings of prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, the halachah goes
            according to those <em>poskim</em> who are lenient, in keeping with the rule, <em>sefeika d'rabbanan l'kula</em> (when there is uncertainty
            regarding rabbinic rulings, we are lenient).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Mabit</em> in <em>Beit Elokim</em>, <em>Sha'ar HaYesodot</em>, chapter 39, explains that from the time of Moshe Rabbeinu until the
            destruction of the Temple, wherever sacrifices were brought the <em>Shechinah</em> was revealed and there was prophecy among Israel; therefore,
even the prayer of an individual was heard. After the destruction of the First Temple and sacrifices were no longer brought,            <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah </em>instituted praying in a <em>minyan</em> so that the <em>Shechinah</em> would dwell among them, thereby
            facilitating the acceptance of their prayers.

            <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em>
            52 maintains that prayer with the <em>chazan</em> as he repeats <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> is considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em> and that is also
the opinion of the <em>Chatam Sofer</em>. So write <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 90:63 and <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 2, 7, as well as the majority of<em>poskim</em>. By contrast, the <em>Pri Megadim</em> (<em>Eshel Avraham</em> 52:1 and 109:4) writes that the essence of prayer in a            <em>minyan</em> is that ten Jews pray the silent <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> together (this can be inferred from the <em>Rama</em> 109:2 as well). So
writes the <em>Igrot Moshe</em> <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 3, 9, and is implied from the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:28 and 52:6, as well. However,<em>Beit Baruch</em> 19:35 attests to the fact that the <em>Chafetz Chaim </em>himself would pray with the <em>chazan</em> so that the            <em>chazan</em> would not wait for him to finish his prayer. In conclusion, it is best to try to pray silently with the congregation in order to
            fulfill one's obligation according to all opinions, but even praying with the <em>chazan</em> is considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em> according
            to the majority of <em>poskim</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
Further, it is implied from the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:35 that the essence of prayer in a <em>minyan</em> is that one begins to recite the            <em>Amidah</em> together with the congregation. However, most <em>poskim</em> write that even if a person is a few <em>berachot</em> ahead or
            behind, he is still considered to be praying in a <em>minyan</em>, as written in <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 2, 7, based on the <em>Pri Chadash</em>
            and others. The <em>Acharonim</em> also disagree concerning whether or not the prayer of six people praying together with four who already prayed
is considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em>. <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 5:7 considers it to be prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, whereas,            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 1, 28, writes that it is not considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, yet they are permitted to
            recite matters of sanctity. In conclusion, there are different levels regarding the status of prayer in a <em>minyan</em>.

            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em>
            5:18 writes that the virtue of coordinating his prayer to the time when the congregation is praying applies specifically when the individual
            praying intends to join a particular congregation. Therefore Rabbi Yitzchak suggested to Rav Nachman that he be notified when exactly the
            congregation was to begin <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, so that he could have in mind to coordinate his prayer with theirs (<em>Berachot</em> 8a).
            However, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:33 writes in the name of the <em>Chayei Adam</em> that a person praying individually may pray immediately
            when the day begins, for surely in big communities there are <em>minyanim</em> at that time and if so, he will certainly be praying when a
            congregation is praying. It seems that when a person cannot be physically present with the congregation, there are different levels. The highest
            level is when an individual has in mind to coordinate his prayers with the prayers of the <em>minyan</em> in which he prays daily. The level below
            that is when a person coordinates his prayer with a different congregation in the area where he lives. An even lower level is when he synchronizes
his prayer with a congregation praying in a different place. The lowest level is when he has in mind to coordinate his prayer with any            <em>minyan</em> that is praying at that moment, for probably anytime he prays, there is a <em>minyan</em> praying then. See <em>Avodah Zarah</em>
            4b and <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>'s explanation in the <em>Tosafot</em>.

            The question is whether the obligation of a <em>mil</em> is measured by time or distance, and from this we can derive whether or not there is an
            obligation to travel up to 18 minutes by car to a <em>minyan</em>. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 163:1, s.v. "<em>B'richuk</em>," writes regarding
            attaining water for washing one's hands (before eating bread) within the walking distance of four <em>mil</em>s before him, that we measure by time
            and not by distance. That is also what is written in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 249:1 concerning traveling on <em>Erev Shabbat</em>. By contrast,
            the <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>92:17, on the subject of washing one's hands before prayer, and 110:30, about <em>tefillat haderech </em>(the
traveler's prayer), writes that it is measured according to distance and that is also what is written in <em>Pitchei Teshuvah</em>,            <em> Yoreh De'ah</em> 112:6. <em>Tefillah K'Hilchatah</em> 8:12 and <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 6:5-6 maintain that this obligation refers to time and
            whoever has a car must travel up to 18 minutes. In practice, one who is traveling on his way is obligated to continue up to 72 minutes, which is
            similar to what is written in <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 163:1. However, if he is in his house, there is disagreement as to whether or not he is
            obligated to travel 18 minutes by car. It is best to be stringent, though those who act according to the lenient opinion have on whom to rely.
            Nonetheless, all of these laws pertain only to a temporary situation, but in a permanent one, every Jew must set up his home no more than a
            distance of an 18-minute walk from a synagogue. If he has no choice and is compelled to live farther away, it is proper for him to accept upon
            himself to walk or drive farther in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            90:107 writes according to <em>Binyan Olam</em> that within a city, a person must walk more than a <em>mil</em>, and the measure of a <em>mil</em>
is specified only when one needs to walk outside the city, as in the laws of <em>techumei</em> <em>Shabbat </em>(Shabbat boundaries). However, the            <em>Chayei</em> <em>Adam</em>, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:52, <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 90:20, and many others maintain that even in the city one
            must walk no more than a <em>mil</em>. Since the mitzvah of a <em>minyan</em> is rabbinic, the halachah goes according to those who are lenient.
            This refers to walking, but regarding driving there is more room to be stringent, since anyway there are <em>poskim</em> who are stringent about
            driving and obligate going to a <em>minyan</em> according to time and not distance.

The <em>Magen Avraham</em> 671:12 writes that when a person is preoccupied with thoughts of his business, he is exempt from going to pray in a            <em>minyan</em>. This implies that if an opportunity arises to gain a large sum of money, far beyond what he usually earns, he is permitted to go
according to those who are lenient and pray individually. However, even for a great profit he may not conduct business before he recites            <em>Shacharit</em>. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:29.

            When the question is whether to pray in a <em>minyan</em> before <em>netz</em> or individually at <em>netz</em>, the <em>Acharonim</em> are
            divided. I have written in chapter 11, note 12, that on a regular basis it seems preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em>. When the <em>minyan</em>
            prays after the conclusion of the first four hours of the day according to the <em>Gra</em> (see further in this book 11:12), then it is preferable
            to pray individually prior to that time. If the <em>minyan</em> prays within the four hours according to the <em>Gra</em> and after the four hours
            according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, then the <em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to which is better. Even in that case it seems preferable on a
            regular basis to pray in a <em>minyan</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> 102 writes that it is permissible to pass in front of a person praying in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>
and hear <em>Kaddish</em>, but merely in order to pray in one's own seat, it is forbidden. Additionally, it goes without saying that even when the            <em>minyan</em> is conducted in a different <em>nusach</em>, he is required to pray in it, and so writes <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 7:17.

            The <em>Amora'im </em>are divided as to whether or not a minor may be counted as part of the <em>minyan</em>. The <em>Rishonim</em> dispute this as
well, as brought in the <em>Beit Yosef</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 55:4. The overwhelming majority of the <em>Rishonim</em>, including the<em>Rambam</em>, <em>Ramban</em>, <em>Rashba</em>, and <em>Rosh</em>, write that he may not be counted. However, <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, the            <em>Razah</em>, and others write that we may be lenient in extenuating circumstances. <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 4, 9, summarizes the issue and
            concludes that it is prohibited for a minor to be included even in extenuating circumstances. Nonetheless, the <em>Maharsham</em>, responsa 3:164,
            and <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 18, permit it in extenuating circumstances because the law of prayer in a <em>minyan</em>
            is rabbinic and in certain situations we can rely on a minority of <em>poskim</em>.

            The definition of an adult is one who has reached thirteen years of age and two hairs have grown in. Yet, practically we are not strict about this
            because praying in a <em>minyan</em> is a rabbinic obligation and we rely on the presumption that he has two hairs. Even if in actuality he does
            not, perhaps he did and they shed. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55, passages 31 and 40.

            According to the <em>Tzemach Tzedek</em> 73 and <em>Divrei Chaim</em>, part 2,<em> Even HaEzer</em>, 72, even if the deaf-mute is a very wise
            person, he is exempt from the <em>mitzvot</em>. According to <em>Maharsham</em>, part 2, 140, and <em>Nachalat Tzvi</em>, he is considered a
            competent person for all<em> </em>intents and purposes. A few <em>Acharonim</em> write that because <em>minyan</em> is a rabbinic ruling, we may
            rely on those who are lenient and count him, as it is written in the responsa of <em>Nachalat Binyamin</em> 31 and <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 2:6. In
            a <em>minyan</em> of this kind, it is better not to have the <em>chazan</em> repeat the <em>Amidah</em>, for some <em>poskim </em>maintain that if
there are not nine people answering, the <em>berachot</em> are close to being in vain. See further on this topic in <em>Nishmat Avraham</em>,            <em>Orach Chaim</em> 1, 55:2, and <em>Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics</em>, entry "deafness." Additionally, if the person who is deaf-mute
was taught to make sounds that are comprehensible to most people, according to all opinions, he may be counted in a <em>minyan</em> (            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 22:26).

            At first glance it seems that there is a contradiction in what the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> writes, for in section 55:6-8, he rules that a
person who is praying, a person who is sleeping, and a deaf person are also counted in a <em>minyan</em>, despite the fact that they cannot answer<em>Amen</em> after the <em>chazan</em>. Whereas in section 124:4, he writes based on the <em>Rosh</em>, "And if there are not nine people who have            <em> kavanah </em>during the <em>chazan</em>'s recital of <em>berachot</em>, his <em>berachot</em> are close to being said in vain." In the opinion
            of most <em>poskim</em>, among them <em>Magen Avraham</em>, <em>Derishah</em>, and others, even those who cannot respond to the <em>chazan</em> are
counted as part of the <em>minyan</em>. Therefore the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> emphasizes "are close to being," meaning that in actuality his<em>berachot</em> are not said in vain. That is what is implied from the <em>Beit Yosef</em> in section 55 who brings the words of the<em>Maharil</em> and the <em>Ram</em>, maintaining that a person who is sleeping and someone who is praying can be counted for            <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>. (There disagreement is about how many people that do not actually answer can be counted. The most lenient opinion allows
            up to four. Regarding one who is sleeping, we may not be lenient with more than one, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:32.)
        </p>
        <p>
In contrast to them, the <em>Taz</em> 55:4 and 124:2 is inclined to say that only those who answer are counted in the <em>minyan</em>. The<em>Graz</em> 55:7 and <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Vayechi</em> 6, differentiate between all the matters of sanctity about which the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> writes in section 55 that even one who does not answer counts, and <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> about which the            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> writes in section 124 that it is necessary to have nine people answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In extenuating circumstances, when there are people who extend their prayers and it is difficult to wait for them to finish, it is possible to heed
            the advice of the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124:19 - that the <em>chazan</em> stipulates that if the ruling is according to those who maintain that
            it is necessary for nine people to answer, then his prayer is considered a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>). In the <em>Musaf</em>
            prayer and Shabbat and festival<em> </em>prayers, the <em>chazan</em> cannot make this stipulation because on Shabbat and festivals a voluntary
prayer may not be recited. Instead, when he is concerned that nine people will not respond to him, either he should rely on the majority of            <em>poskim</em> who say there is no need to have nine people answer or he should not pray the silent <em>Amidah</em> with them and this way he can
            recite the <em>Amidah</em> repetition without doubt, for he himself is fulfilling his obligation through this prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            On weekdays, when the <em>minyan</em> is smaller, we can rely on the advice given further in this book (19:5) that the <em>minyan</em> may pray the
            abridged <em>Chazarat HaShatz </em>and the <em>chazan</em> recites the first three <em>berachot</em> out loud in order to say <em>Kedushah</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to almost all opinions, a person who prays word for word with the <em>chazan</em> is counted as part of the <em>minyan</em> even though
            he does not answer <em>Amen</em>.

            <em>Melamed L'hoil</em>
            ,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 29 and <em>Binyan Tziyon HaChadashot</em> 23 rule to count a person who desecrates the Shabbat as part of a <em>minyan</em>.
            That is also how my teacher and rabbi,<em> </em>Rav Avraham Elkanah Shapira,<em> ztz"l</em>, ruled in practice. The foundation for their rationale
            is brought in <em>Igrot Ra'ayah</em>, part 1, 138, that the atmosphere of these generations entices people to sin almost against their will and
therefore, sinners today are considered nearly <em>annusim</em>. Similarly, the <em>Chazon Ish</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 87:14 and            <em>Yoreh De'ah</em> 2:28, writes that most non-religious Jews have the status of <em>tinok shenishbah</em> (a child who was captured and raised
            among gentiles) and not <em>mumar lehachis</em> (a sinner who intentionally defies the Torah). Many other <em>Acharonim</em> have also dealt with
this issue. There are those who are stringent, see <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 15:16. Nevertheless, we have already learned that prayer in a            <em>minyan</em> is a rabbinic ruling and the halachah goes according to those who are lenient.

            It is implied in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 55:14, that anyone who is visible, even if he is in a different domain, can be counted. That is what
            the <em>Beit Yosef</em> says in the name of <em>Orchot Chaim</em> who quotes <em>Rav Hai Gaon</em> and the <em>Rashba</em>. Additionally, it is
enough that a few of them can see him, as is clarified in the ruling of <em>zimun</em> (literally, invitation, three people blessing<em>Birkat HaMazon</em> together) <em>Orach Chaim</em> 195:1. However, the <em>Sheyarei Knesset HaGedolah</em>,<em> Hagahot </em>on the            <em> Beit Yosef </em>6, writes that according to the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em>, only if he brings his face into the space of the window can
            he be counted. So it is written in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:70, based on some <em>Acharonim</em>. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:52 essentially
rules according to the lenient opinion, and therefore, one who prays in the women's section, if his face is visible, is counted as part of the            <em>minyan</em>. However, he writes that <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is good to follow the stringent opinion, and hence it is better that he actually
            enter the synagogue in order to complete the <em>minyan</em>.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 55:58 writes, based on the <em>Radbaz</em>, that one who prays in a room in which the only entrance is through the
synagogue, even if he is not visible to those praying and therefore does not complete the <em>minyan</em>, he is indeed considered as praying in a            <em>minyan</em> since the room in which he is present is ancillary to the room in which they are praying. According to this, a person who prays in
the women's section, even though he does not show his face and he does not complete a <em>minyan</em>, is considered to be praying in a            <em>minyan</em>. The reason for this is that the women's section is auxiliary to the synagogue, and although it has its own separate entrance, in
            its essence it is subsidiary to the synagogue. However, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is good to actually enter the synagogue to pray because there are
those who are stringent concerning this matter and do not equate the women's section with the inner room to which the <em>Radbaz</em> refers (            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 5:12).

            is not present with them "may answer," but is not obligated to answer. However, in the name of the <em>Chazon Ish</em>, he writes that one is
            obligated to answer. If there is an idol worshiper or a statue of idol worship standing between the <em>chazan</em> and the one who hears him, or
            if there is excrement located there, he may not answer <em>Amen</em> after the <em>chazan</em>. But if he listens to the radio, we do not fear that
            the radio waves pass through filthy places, since the voice is recreated through a receiver. That is also the reason why we may not fulfill our
            obligation of prayer or hearing <em>megillah</em> reading by listening to the radio, because the sound that is coming out of the radio is
            considered a different voice.
