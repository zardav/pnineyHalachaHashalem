        1. <em>Gozez</em> (Shearing)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Gozez</em> (shearing) is the removal of
        things that grow on the body, such as hair, nails, warts, loose skin,
        and the like. In contrast, one who actually cuts skin and draws blood
        transgresses the prohibition of <em>Ĥovel</em> (see below 20:9.) For
        the <em>Mishkan</em>, lamb’s wool was sheared and then made into thread
that was used to make the curtains. Similarly, hair was sheared from        <em>taĥash</em> skins so that the skins would be smooth and thus fit
        for use as curtains in the <em>Mishkan</em>. We see that sometimes
        shearing is done in order to use material that is attached to a body,
        as is the case when sheep’s wool is needed to make thread, and
        sometimes it is done to remove something unwanted, as is the case when
        removing unwanted hairs to improve animal skins (Rivash; BHL 340:1 s.v.
        "ve-ĥayav").
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Kotzer</em>, where the prohibition
        applies only if one cuts off a plant from its life source (below 19:6),
        here the prohibition applies to shearing wool from the skin of a dead
        animal as well, because even after an animal’s death there is still a
        purpose to shearing its wool. Therefore, one should be careful not to
        pull out threads from a fur coat or a leather carpet (MB 340:5). If
        doing so serves a purpose, the prohibition is by Torah law; if there is
        no purpose, the prohibition is rabbinic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Included in the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Gozez</em> is plucking feathers
        from a chicken. However, one may pluck feathers from a cooked chicken.
        This is because after a chicken is cooked it is considered food, and
        the prohibition of shearing does not apply to food (R. Eliyahu David
        Rabinowitz-Teomim [Aderet], <em>Oveir Oraĥ</em> §366; <em>Har Tzvi</em>
        , <em>Tal Harim</em>, <em>Gozez</em> 3).
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. <em>Gozez </em>and <em>Ĥovel </em>of Human Beings
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as one may not shear an animal’s wool, so too one may not remove
        anything growing from the human body, such as hairs, nails, loose skin,
        and warts. One who removes them in the usual fashion transgresses a
        Torah prohibition, while one who removes them with a <em>shinui</em>
        transgresses a rabbinic prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, one who cuts his nails using a nail scissors or clippers
        transgresses a Torah prohibition, while one who pulls them off with his
        teeth transgresses a rabbinic prohibition (MT 9:8). One should make
        every effort to stop biting his nails entirely; apart from being
        impolite, a habitual nail biter is likely to bite his nails on Shabbat
        as well, thus violating Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one may not remove warts. If the wart is wet, cutting it
with an instrument is a Torah prohibition, while removing it with a        <em>shinui</em>, via teeth or hands, is a rabbinic transgression. If
        the wart is dried out and liable to fall off on its own, then even
removing it with an instrument is only a rabbinic transgression (        <em>ibid</em>.; SA 340:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 6).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not scrape the body to remove skin that has begun to peel. One
        may not even use one’s teeth to remove the skin from his chapped lips.
        However, one may remove dandruff, since it is only very loosely
        attached to the skin, and it falls out readily.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a nail was torn off most of the way and is now painful, it may be
        removed using one’s hands or one’s teeth. Since most of it has already
        been torn off, it is viewed as if it has already fallen off, and the
        prohibition on finishing the job is only rabbinic. The Sages permit
removing the nail with a <em>shinui</em> if it is causing pain (        <em>Shabbat</em> 94b; SA 328:31; <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 21:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not scratch a cut in a way that will make it bleed, because
        doing so constitutes <em>Ĥovel</em> (see below 20:9). Even though one
        who scratches is not interested in drawing blood, it is still
        rabbinically prohibited (MB 316:30). Similarly, one may not brush his
        teeth if it is almost certain that his gums will bleed. One also may
        not knowingly suck the blood out of his gums after brushing them to the
        point that they bleed, as this constitutes <em>Ĥovel</em> (MB 328:147;
        section 7 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may remove a splinter lodged in a person’s flesh as long as one is
        careful not to draw blood. If the splinter is painful, one may remove
        it even it will certainly cause bleeding. This is because drawing blood
        in this situation is rabbinically prohibited, and the Sages did not
        extend their prohibition to cases that entail such pain (MB 328:88).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may remove a scab from a wound that has dried and will not bleed
        upon the scab’s removal. This does not qualify as <em>Gozez</em> since
        scabs do not grow from the body, but rather are just dried blood from a
        wound (SA 328:22).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Brushing and Braiding Hair
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not brush or comb one’s hair on Shabbat, because when doing so
        hairs are pulled out. This is actually a beneficial phenomenon. Every
        day a person sheds dozens of hairs naturally. People would rather that
        hairs with weak roots be pulled out during brushing rather than fall
        out on their own in the course of the day, thus making their hair
        unkempt and their clothes unsightly. In any event, since one may not
        brush his hair on Shabbat, brushes are considered <em>muktzeh</em> and
        may not be moved on Shabbat (SA 303:27).
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, one who wishes to make one’s hair neater may use a
        special brush with soft or widely spaced bristles, so that there is a
        reasonable chance that it will not pull out hair. Then, even if he does
        happen to pull out hair, he does not violate a <em>melakha</em>. This
        is because his intention is not to pull out hair, hair will not
        necessarily be pulled out, and the brush is not <em>muktzeh</em>. In
        order to make sure it does not look like he is using a prohibited
        brush, it is advisable to designate a brush for use specifically on
        Shabbat (see SSK 14:50).
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may gently rub one’s hair or beard, and one may use one’s fingers
        to arrange them and to remove anything stuck in them, as long as one is
        careful not to pull out hairs. Even if these actions might cause hairs
        to be removed, one may do so, as this is unintentional. One who
        generally tugs at his beard in a way that causes hair to be pulled out
        must refrain from doing so on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade braiding hair on Shabbat, because making a braid
        resembles the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Boneh</em>. Similarly, one may
not undo a braid, because this resembles <em>melakha</em> of        <em>Soter</em>. One may gather hair into a ponytail, as this does not
        create a structure. Similarly, one may part one’s hair using one’s
        hands, but one may not use a brush or comb to do so, as this will pull
        out hairs (SA 303:26; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 84).
    </p>
    <p>
Braiding a wig is also forbidden because it resembles weaving - the        <em>melakha</em> of <em>Oreg </em>- while one may not undo a braid
because this constitutes "undoing a weave" - the <em>melakha</em> of        <em>Potze’a</em> (MB 303:82; SHT <em>ad loc</em>. 71). It is proper to
        refrain from combing a wig, but one may do so using a soft brush that
        will not pull out hairs (SSK 14:52). If a wig has become so tangled
        that it cannot be worn outside, then one may not style it even using
one’s hands, as it constitutes <em>Makeh Be-fatish</em> (        <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> 143, <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan</em> 6).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is rabbinically prohibited to curl one’s hair, which includes men
curling their sidelocks (<em>peyot</em>), because this is similar to        <em>Boneh</em>. Straightening hair or sidelocks is prohibited because
        of <em>Soter</em>. But if the sidelocks were already curled, they may
        be twirled even though this may tighten the curls, because no new
        structure is formed (<em>Tiferet Yisrael</em> on <em>Shabbat</em> ch.
10, <em>Yakhin</em> 35; see <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> 146,        <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan</em> 21).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not use hair spray or oil to keep one’s hair in place, because
        this is similar to <em>Boneh</em> (Rivash as cited in BHL 303:27 s.v.
        "laĥof"). One may not use these substances on wigs either (SSK 14:56).
        However, women may spray perfume on their hair or bodies (MB 128:23;
        SSK 14:56-57).
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Applying Makeup
    </h2>
    <p>
One of the 39 <em>melakhot </em>forbidden on Shabbat is        <em>Tzove’a</em> (dyeing). By Torah law, it is limited to long-lasting
        paints or dyes applied to surfaces that will retain them for an
        extended period (see below 18:5). The Sages, however, prohibited even
        color that will not last for a long period, and even if it is applied
        to a surface that will not retain the color. One example of this is the
        prohibition on the use of makeup, which colors one’s skin for a short
        time. Accordingly, one may not use eye shadow, blush, lipstick, or
        clear lip gloss that provides a shine. Similarly, one may not use even
        clear nail polish, because the shine it provides is considered color.
        While this prohibition pertains to applying makeup, removing makeup
        with water or cotton is permissible. Cotton balls soaked in water
        should not be used, because of the prohibition of <em>Seĥita</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also forbidden to apply foundation, a cosmetic used to even out
        one’s complexion. This prohibition is more severe than the prohibition
        on using other types of makeup, because in addition to transgressing
        the rabbinic prohibition of <em>Tzove’a</em>, one might also transgress
        the Torah prohibition of <em>Memare’aĥ</em> (see the next section) if
        one is using cream foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use powder, however, whether white or colored, because powder
        has no adhesive agent. It is only when the material used for coloring
        adheres to the skin that there is a prohibition of <em>Tzove’a</em>; in
        contrast, if it just stays on the surface of the face and does not
adhere to it, one may apply it (<em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 1:114;        <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:28). Some are stringent even in such cases
        (Maharam Brisk 1:23; <em>Beit Yisrael</em> §56). However, since this
        disagreement pertains to a rabbinic prohibition, the <em>halakha</em>
        is in accordance with those who are lenient.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition on wearing makeup is one of the most difficult to
        follow. For a woman who is used to putting on makeup every day, it is
        not easy to refrain from doing so on Shabbat, especially since it is
        precisely Shabbat when everyone tries to look their best. However, if
        we explore the issue more deeply, perhaps we can suggest that this, on
        the contrary, relates to the main idea of Shabbat, a day of holiness
        and rest. Shabbat is when we take a break from the tension that we
        experience throughout the week. We work so hard to present ourselves to
        others as more beautiful than we naturally are, in an attempt to meet
        society’s cruel and superficial standards of beauty. In contrast,
        Shabbat helps us truly relax by strengthening our faith and belief in
        divine providence. We can achieve this spiritual relaxation when we
        attain an internal acceptance of existence as it is, and an
        appreciation of our natural beauty, which we highlight with clothing
        and jewelry. This is <em>oneg Shabbat</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, before Shabbat, one may, and even should, put on makeup.
        The Sages state: "One who labors before Shabbat will eat on Shabbat"
        (AZ 3a). During the week, it is our mission to fix the world, improve
        it, and prepare it for Shabbat. This allows us to absorb the divine
        light more completely. However, if we are unable to prepare ourselves
        fully for Shabbat - for example, we know that makeup applied on Friday
        will not last through the whole of Shabbat - once Shabbat arrives we
        must calmly and joyfully accept existence as it is. This very
        acceptance is what will allow us to continue to fix and improve the
        world during the week.
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Applying Oils, Perfumes, Creams, and Lotions
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may apply oil to the hands or body on Shabbat in the manner that
        people normally anoint themselves for pleasure. Similarly, a woman may
        rub her hair or body with perfumed oil. It is true that the Sages
forbade perfuming a garment, because scenting clothing involves        <em>Molid</em> (producing something new that did not previously exist),
which is similar to performing a <em>melakha</em> (<em>Beitza</em> 23a;        <em>Beit Yosef</em> and Rema 511:4). However, there is no prohibition
        on applying perfume to the body or hair, because the scent is
        completely secondary to the body, and therefore it is not considered
        producing something new.
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although one may rub his body with oil, he may not apply cream because
of the prohibition of <em>Memare’aĥ</em>, which is a <em>tolada</em> of        <em>Memaĥek</em> (see below 18:6). <em>Memaĥek</em> refers to smoothing
        rough surfaces such as leather or wood, while <em>Memare’aĥ</em>
        involves evenly applying a substance to an object in order to make it
        smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, one may not apply any type of cream or ointment to the skin,
        because in doing so one smoothes the cream onto the skin. Some object
        that this should not be prohibited, since the cream is meant to be
        absorbed by the body rather than to remain on the surface of the skin.
        However, this is incorrect, since even when one wants the cream to be
        absorbed, he also wants some of it to remain on the skin’s surface to
        make it smooth. Hence the prohibition of <em>Memare’aĥ</em> applies. In
        contrast, if the cream is watery, such that if it is left on a surface
        it will spread out, there is no prohibition of <em>Memare’aĥ</em>, and
        one may apply it to the body.
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Liquid insect repellent may be used on Shabbat, but if it is a solid,
one may not spread it on the body because of the prohibition of        <em>Memare’aĥ</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who is experiencing mild discomfort may not apply medicinal oil.
        Furthermore, a healthy person may not apply medicinal oil for pleasure,
        since the Sages prohibited the use of medicines on Shabbat. However, if
        one is truly suffering, he may use medicinal oil. If this oil is also
        used by healthy people, then since it will not be apparent that it is
        being used medicinally, even one who is experiencing discomfort may
        apply it (SA 327:1; below 28:4-5). The laws pertaining to massage, both
        professional and amateur, will be explained below (28:13).
    </p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. Bar Soap, Liquid Soap, and Wipes
    </h2>
    <p>
        While one may use liquid soap to wash one’s hands, the general practice
        is to be stringent about bar soap or thick liquid soap. There are two
reasons for this. First, using bar soap or thick liquid soap resembles        <em>Memaĥek</em>, since using a bar of soap smooths its surface and
        thick liquid soap is spread on the hands or body. Second, when one uses
        these kinds of soap it looks like he is producing something new, since
the soap changes from solid to liquid. Although according to many        <em>poskim</em> this use is not technically prohibited, because the
        person using the soap does not intend to smooth it and because the
        small amount of soap that is used is dissolved in the water, so it does
        not seem like anything new is being created, nevertheless, since there
        is some resemblance to <em>Memare’aĥ</em> and <em>Molid</em>, the
        common custom is to be stringent and avoid using bar soap or thick
        liquid soap. Those who are lenient have an opinion to rely upon.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a thick liquid soap spreads out upon being left on a surface, it is
        considered liquid, and all would agree that one may use it on Shabbat.
        If it is uncertain whether a substance is considered thick or liquid,
        one may be lenient.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use wet wipes to clean a baby, to clean one’s body in general,
        or to clean a table and the like. Some are stringent because they
        maintain that there is a problem of <em>Seĥita</em>, since when using a
        wipe, one presses on it and squeezes out some moisture, which would
        help in cleaning. Nevertheless, the lenient opinion is the primary one,
        because the purpose of a wipe is to use the moisture on the surface of
        the wipe to clean more effectively. The purpose is not to squeeze out
        the moisture inside the wipe in order to wet the dirty area. If that
        were one’s goal, he would simply wash the area with water. As long as
        the wipe remains damp, he has no interest in the moisture that has not
        been squeezed out and separated from it, and thus no transgression has
        taken place. Even if, by chance, a couple of drops were squeezed out,
        since one did not intend for this to happen, he has not transgressed.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        As we have seen (above 13:11), if one went to the bathroom and has no
        way to wipe himself other than to tear toilet paper, he may do so with
        a <em>shinui</em> such as using his elbows to pull the paper from the
        roll. This is because the Sages permitted transgressing a rabbinic
        prohibition to avoid great embarrassment. One may also, when necessary,
        wet toilet paper so it will clean more effectively, as long as one does
        not intend to squeeze out water from the toilet paper but only to make
        use of the moisture.
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Brushing Teeth and Toothpaste
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may brush one’s teeth on Shabbat to clean them and to treat bad
        breath. Similarly, mouthwash may be used to freshen one’s breath.
        However, it is proper to refrain from using toothpaste, the same way we
        refrain from using bar soap or thick liquid soap.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it is true that some forbid brushing teeth on Shabbat, either due
        to the concern of <em>Seĥita</em>, because the gums might bleed, or
        because the bristles of the toothbrush might break, nevertheless, the
        primary halakhic position is that one may brush one’s teeth with a
        toothbrush <em>le-khatĥila</em>. It is only in a case where it is
        almost certain that the gums will bleed that this is prohibited.
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may wash off the toothbrush with water after brushing, as one
        normally does, even if one does not intend to use the toothbrush again
        on Shabbat. This is not considered preparing for the weekday on
        Shabbat, because it is simply a matter of routine and is not considered
        a significant chore. Furthermore, removing the residue from the brush
        also serves a purpose on Shabbat, as leaving it dirty would be
        disgusting (see MB 667:6; below 22:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may clean one’s teeth with a toothpick (SA 322:4). If there is no
        toothpick available, a match may be used. While it is true that matches
        are <em>muktzeh</em>, they are <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em>,
        and one may handle them in order to use them for a permitted activity
        (below, 23:7). Of course, one must remember that one may not sharpen
        the match for this purpose, as sharpening it would violate a Torah
        prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use denture adhesive powder to attach false teeth to the gums,
as this is meant for the short term (<em>Har Tzvi</em>;        <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 15:25; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 314:17; as opposed
        to SSK 14:40, who is stringent).
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. Bathing on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade bathing the body in hot water on Shabbat. This is
        because some people were so eager to bathe in hot water that they would
heat the water on Shabbat, thus transgressing both <em>Hav’ara</em>        <em> </em>and <em>Bishul</em>. When they were admonished, they would
        claim that the water had been heated before Shabbat. Therefore, the
        Sages forbade bathing one’s body on Shabbat, even in water heated
        before Shabbat. However, one may wash less than half of the body in hot
        water. As long as one refrains from washing most of the body, there is
        no concern that one will succumb and heat the water on Shabbat for the
        lessened pleasure of bathing less than half of the body. Even when
        washing each limb individually, one still may not wash the majority of
        one’s body with hot water (<em>Shabbat</em> 40a; SA 326:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        We have seen that one may use hot water already available in the boiler
        as long as this usage does not cause additional water to be cooked
        (above 10:24). We have also seen that many permit using water that was
        heated on Shabbat with solar power (10:25). According to this approach,
        one may use this water to wash the hands, face, and less than half of
        the body. However, one still may not use this water to wash most of the
        body on account of the rabbinic enactment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition on washing the body is specifically limited to hot
        water. One may wash the whole body in cold or lukewarm water whose
        temperature is lower than body temperature. One may even turn on the
        hot water tap so that the water will not be cold, as long as this does
        not cause the cold water entering the boiler to be cooked (as explained
        above 10:24-25).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also important to note that the prohibition of washing the body
        in hot water is limited to normal circumstances. One who suffers
        greatly if he must go a whole day without bathing in hot water may wash
his whole body in water that was heated on Friday<strong> </strong>or        <strong> </strong>by a solar boiler (R. Akiva Eger; BHL 326:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who bathes on Shabbat must take care not to wring out his hair with
        his hands while washing or drying off, in order to avoid the
        prohibition of <em>Seĥita</em>. He may, however, towel his hair dry.
        Since he is not interested in the water that is wrung from the hair and
        absorbed by the towel, there is no prohibition. A woman who always
        combs or brushes her hair after bathing must be careful not to wash her
        hair on Shabbat, in order to avoid the prohibition of <em>Gozez</em>
        (see section 3 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages further cautioned that if one washes in a river, spring, or
        sea in an area where there is no <em>eruv</em>, he should shake the
        water off himself when he gets out and thus avoid carrying the water
        the distance of four <em>amot</em>. He does not have to be totally dry;
        it is sufficient to remove the excess water that drips from his body.
In contrast, there is no rabbinic decree against walking in        <em>reshut ha-rabim </em>when wet from rain. This is because rain does
        not get one as wet as bathing, and even if there is enough rainwater on
        one’s body that it could be considered carrying, the Sages were not
stringent, since the rain falls on him against his will (<em>Shabbat</em> 141a; <em>Beit Yosef</em> and SA 326:7; <em>Taz</em>        <em>ad loc.</em> 2).

        9. Swimming and Immersion in a <em>Mikveh</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages prohibited swimming on Shabbat, because one might come to
        build or mend a raft. One who lifts his feet from the ground and floats
        in the water is considered swimming. However, if he does not lift his
feet, then he is considered bathing, which is permitted (        <em>Beitza</em> 36b; <em>Shabbat</em> 40b; SA 339:2). Technically, one
        may swim in a pool located in a fenced-off area and where the water is
        confined by the walls of the pool, as in such a case we are not
concerned that one might build a raft or carry water outside the        <em>eruv</em>. Nevertheless, since nowadays swimming has become one of
        the most common weekday leisure activities, it is prohibited as a
        weekday activity (<em>uvdin de-ĥol</em>). Furthermore, there is a
        concern that after swimming, people will wring out their bathing suits.
        Moreover, it is improper for one to waste free time on Shabbat with
        leisure activities instead of dedicating it to Torah study.

    </p>
    <p>
        One may immerse in a <em>mikveh</em> on Shabbat to remove impurity.
Even though the Sages prohibit immersing implements (        <em>tevilat kelim</em>) on Shabbat, this is because it resembles fixing
        the implement, since as a result of the immersion the implement may be
        used. A person, however, may immerse on Shabbat to purify himself since
        he may anyway bathe in cold water and thus it does not resemble an act
        of fixing or improving something (<em>Beitza</em> 18a; SA 326:8). While
        it is true that, for several reasons, the Ashkenazic custom is to avoid
        bathing in cold water on Shabbat, when it is done for the purpose of a
        mitzva, the custom is not to be stringent (Rema, YD 197:2). Therefore,
        men who are accustomed to immerse as an act of piety may do so on
        Shabbat as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether the rabbinic ban on bathing on
        Shabbat applies to immersion in a <em>mikveh</em>. Some maintain that
        the Sages did not include immersion for the sake of a mitzva in their
        decree, and thus one may immerse in hot water as long as it was heated
        in a permissible fashion (<em>Korban Netanel</em>). Others maintain
        that the enactment applies to this immersion as well, and thus one may
        not even immerse in hot water on Shabbat (<em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>).
        Many are customarily lenient and immerse in hot water. Those who wish
        to be stringent should make sure that the water is lukewarm, lower than
        body temperature, as most <em>poskim</em> agree that one may bathe on
        Shabbat. Thus, one may certainly immerse for the sake of a mitzva.

            One commits <em>Gozez</em><em> </em>whether shearing because he
            wants the wool or because he wants to beautify the body by removing
unsightly growth from it. The latter is similar to shearing the<em>taĥash</em> skins in order to make them into curtains for the            <em>Mishkan</em>. Since it is generally in one’s interest for some
            hairs to fall out while he is brushing his hair, doing so is
            prohibited by Torah law (Rivash §39; SHT 303:72). However,
            according to MT, Laws of Nazirism 5:14, a nazirite who brushes his
            hair is not subject to lashes. Radbaz explains that even though it
            is in the interest of the nazirite for some hairs to fall out, the
            prohibition is only rabbinic because the hairs have weak roots and
thus are likely to fall out in any case. <em>Eglei Tal</em>,            <em>Gozez</em> 15 suggests this as well. <em>Kesef Mishneh</em>
            explains that according to Rambam the prohibition is rabbinic
            because one does not intend for his hair to fall out; he is
            primarily concerned with arranging his hair, not pulling it out.
            Additionally, it is not certain that any hair will be pulled out at
            all.

Some forbid making the body smell good, on account of            <em>Molid</em> (<em>Taz</em> 511:8; MA 511:11; <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>
            , Year 2, Tetzaveh 11). At the opposite extreme, some maintain that
            one may infuse a garment with scent (<em>Rishon Le-Tziyon</em>,
            based on Rif, Rambam, and Rosh). However, most <em>poskim</em>
            maintain that while one may not make clothing smell good, one may
            make the body smell good (MB 128:23; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 1:31;
            SSK 14:36).

            If one would like all the cream to be absorbed into the body and
none to remain on the skin, then there is no prohibition of            <em>Memare’aĥ</em> (MA 316:24; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 49). Therefore,
            if one is sick enough that he may receive medical treatment on
            Shabbat, and he requires a cream, it may be spread on the skin and
rubbed in until it is absorbed entirely by the body (            <em>Da’at Torah</em> 328:26; R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach cited in SSK
            ch. 33 n. 64). However, those who use cosmetic cream for pleasure
            or beauty do not want it to be entirely absorbed. Rather, they want
            some to stay on the surface of the skin, making it smooth and
            beautiful. Therefore, it is prohibited by Torah law to apply that
            cream.

            MB 326:30 is stringent, based on <em>Tiferet Yisrael</em>, and
maintains that one should not use this kind of soap because of<em>Memare’aĥ</em>. This is also the opinion of<em>Ma’aseh Ish</em>, p. 109, and R. Shmuel Laniado,            <em>Shulĥan Ha-melekh</em>. <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em> Year 2, Yitro 15
is stringent on account of <em>Molid</em>. However, several<em>poskim</em> are lenient, including <em>Paĥad Yitzĥak</em>,<em>Ginat Veradim</em>, and <em>Pe’ulat Tzadik</em>.            <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> agrees (138, <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan</em>
            31). <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 4:27 elaborates on this approach, adding
            that Rambam presents it in a responsum. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach,
            cited in SSK ch. 14 n. 49, states that technically one may use this
            kind of soap. Rather, it is an example of "things that are
            permitted but custom forbids," and in such cases one should follow
the custom. In practice, both SSK<em> </em>14:18 and            <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:35:5 forbid using it. R. Ovadia Yosef
            writes in <em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4, p. 108, that it is proper
            to be stringent, and that this is the custom. However, it would
            seem that under pressing circumstances one may rely on those who
            are lenient, and even more so if one is uncertain whether his soap
            is considered thick or liquid. If there are cracks in bar soap and
            one wishes to smooth them out, this is prohibited according to all
            opinions.

Those who are stringent include <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 13:46 and            <em>Ĥut </em><em>Shani</em> vol. 2, p. 209. <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em>
            10:25 and <em>Shevet Ha-Levi</em> 8:59 and 10:58 incline this way
as well. Opposing them are <em>Har Tzvi</em> 1:190 and            <em>Va-ya’an Yosef</em> OĤ §163, which rule leniently. Many others

Those who prohibit include <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 3:48 and            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 17:29. SSK states in 14:39 that the custom
            is to be stringent. The logic of those who forbid brushing is that
            it causes bleeding and can break the bristles of the toothbrush.
            Both claims are incorrect. Since it is rare for either thing to
            happen, they would be cases of <em>davar she-eino mitkaven</em> and
thus brushing is permitted. Some also raise the problem of            <em>Seĥita</em>, as water may be squeezed out of the bristles
            during the brushing. In response, those who permit explain that
            such squeezing is a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in a case
            of a double rabbinic prohibition. First, wringing out hair and the
            like is only rabbinically prohibited; second, it is done in a
            backhanded way. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach maintains that it is to
            one’s advantage (<em>niĥa lei</em>) for the water to be squeezed
            out, because this improves the cleaning. However, generally the
            bristles of a toothbrush are neither very long nor very tightly
            packed, so usually no <em>Seĥita</em> occurs at all. If one rinses
            his mouth with mouthwash before brushing, then R. Shlomo Zalman
Auerbach would agree that it is a            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em>. Those who permit tooth
brushing in practice are <em>Seridei Esh</em> 2:28;            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 1:112; <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:35:6; and
R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 320:28:2).            <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> and <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 4:27-30 permit
            using toothpaste as well.

            Even though technically one may wash one’s whole body in cold
            water, the Ashkenazic custom is to be stringent out of concern that
            one might wring out his hair upon leaving the water, that one might
            carry water four <em>amot</em> in a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em>, or
that one might come to swim (<em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> §255;<em>Maharil</em> <em>Ĥadashot</em> §139; MA 326:8; MB            <em>ad loc</em>. 21). However, even those who are stringent
            regarding Shabbat agree that on Yom Tov one may bathe the entire
            body in cool or cold water. One who does so must be careful not to
            wring out his hair with his hands. He must dry off with a towel
            instead (SSK 14:11). Some write that even when using a towel, one
            must be careful to be gentle in drying off (<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>,
            Year 2, Pekudei 8). I did not include the Ashkenazic custom
            prohibiting bathing in cold water in the main text, because it
            rarely arises, and it applies only to those few individuals who
            normally bathe for pleasure in cold water. In contrast, if there is
            an element of anguish involved, we are lenient about washing in
            either cold or hot water. Nevertheless, it is clear that Ashkenazic
            custom forbids swimming in a pool. While it is true that Sephardic
            custom follows the letter of the law and permits both bathing in
cold water and swimming in an enclosed pool in a            <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em>, nevertheless, it seems that swimming in a
            pool should be prohibited even for Sephardim. This is because
            people generally swim in swimsuits, and there is a serious concern
            that they might wring them out. Furthermore, in the past the entire
            leniency of swimming in a pool was relevant only to uncommon cases
            of individuals who had a small pool in their yard and would float
            around in it for a short while. In contrast, pools built today are
            meant to be used for extended periods. Because swimming in a pool
            is a normal leisure activity, it is considered a weekday activity.
            If swimming on Shabbat were permitted, people would waste time that
            they could use for Torah learning, and they would miss out on that
            key aspect of Shabbat. <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 326:11 (in vol. 4, p.
            69) states similarly. See also the laws regarding running and
            exercising, below 22:7-8.

            Shabbat may not immerse on Shabbat. Accordingly, the Vilna Gaon
            writes that a man who had a nocturnal emission may not immerse on
Shabbat. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of Ashkenazic<em>poskim</em> permit any immersion on Shabbat. Rema YD 197:2, AHS            <em>ad loc</em>. 8, and <em>Taharat Yisrael</em> 14 rule
            accordingly with regard to women’s immersion. Those who permit
men’s immersion include <em>Olat Shabbat</em> 326:15;            <em>Eliya Rabba</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 5; <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em>

            Aĥaronim attest to the practice of women immersing on Friday night
in hot water (<em>Divrei Ĥayim</em> 2:26; R. Yehuda Ayash in<em>Responsa</em> <em>Bnei Yehuda</em> 2:32;            <em>Responsa Divrei Yosef</em> §64). In contrast, others maintain
that immersion in hot water is included in the rabbinic prohibition            <em> </em>(<em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>, 2: 24; <em>Ĥakham Tzvi</em>
            §11; <em>Beit Meir</em>, beginning of §326; <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>
            70:1; and R. Akiva Eger 1:17). SHT 326:5 states that one may be
            lenient only under pressing circumstance. However, in practice many
are lenient and permit women to immerse in hot water. Thus state            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 2:21, n. 30; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:10, n.
            173; and <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan</em> 197:17. <em>Livyat Ĥen </em>§79
            states (following <em>Ĥakham Tzvi</em>) that <em>le-khatĥila</em> a
            woman should immerse during <em>bein ha-shmashot </em>(dusk), since
            rabbinic prohibitions on Shabbat do not apply to <em>mitzvot</em>
            that are undertaken during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>. If she is
            unable to immerse during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, she may immerse
            in hot water on Shabbat. It seems to me that those who wish to be
            stringent should preferably immerse in lukewarm water, since there
            are three opinions regarding the nature of the prohibition of
            washing in hot water (mentioned in the previous section):
        </p>
        <p>
            1) According to <em>Beit Me’ir</em> and R. Akiva Eger, even water
            that has been heated slightly to remove its chill is prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
            2) According to <em>Ĥakham Tzvi</em> §11, <em>Ĥatam Sofer</em> OĤ
            §146, and <em>Tehila Le-David</em> 326:3, the prohibition applies
            to lukewarm water, but water that has been heated merely to remove
            its chill is permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            3) According to <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda </em>2:24,<em> Ĥayei Adam </em>
            70:1,<em> Zera Emet </em>1:71,<em> </em>and<em> </em>AHS<em> </em>
            326:3, the prohibition pertains only to hot water, but lukewarm
            water is permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, even according to the opinion that one may not immerse in hot
            water, according to <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda </em>and those who follow
            his approach one may immerse in lukewarm water. If the heat of the
water is slightly cooler than body temperature, it may be that            <em>Ĥakham Tzvi</em> and those who follow his approach would agree
            that this is not forbidden. Therefore, one who wishes to be
            stringent should heat the water to body temperature or lower. The
            subsequent immersion thereby complies with the overwhelming
            majority of <em>poskim</em>, and at the same time does not cause
            suffering.
