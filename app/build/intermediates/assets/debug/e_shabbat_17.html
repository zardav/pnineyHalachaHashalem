        1. Turning on Electric Lights and Appliances
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is prohibited by Torah law to turn on an electric light bulb or
        activate an electric heating element, because when the bulb is turned
        on or a heating element activated, the filament incandesces (see above,
4:5 and n. 3, regarding fluorescent bulbs), and this is a form of        <em>Hav’ara</em><em> </em>prohibited by the Torah. While it is true
        that in the past, people did not generally produce heat or light by
        heating metal, we nevertheless find that heating metal for any purpose
        was prohibited by Torah law. Thus Rambam writes that if one heats metal
        with the intention of tempering it afterward by plunging it into cold
        water, he transgresses the Torah prohibition of <em>Mav’ir </em>(MT
        12:1). Clearly, then, heating metal is forbidden by Torah law if it
        accomplishes some purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Extinguishing a light bulb or heating element is only rabbinically
        prohibited. It is different from a normal act of <em>Mekhabeh</em>,
        whose purpose is to create charcoal (as explained above 16:5). In
        contrast, turning off an electrical appliance creates nothing, so its
        prohibition is rabbinic.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah forbids performing prohibited <em>melakhot</em><em> </em>by
        means of electrical appliances. Thus, activating an electric flour mill
        on Shabbat constitutes a violation of <em>Toĥen</em>, operating an
electric mixer on Shabbat violates <em>Lash</em>, and so forth for all        <em>melakhot</em>. Although the person is not manually grinding or
        kneading, since he presses the button or flips the switch to turn the
        appliance on, all <em>melakhot</em> performed by the appliance are
viewed as <em>melakhot</em><em> </em>performed by him (        <em>Oraĥ Mishpat</em> §70; <em>Aĥiezer</em> 3:60).
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as one may not turn on an electrical appliance by pressing a
        button, so too one may not activate something by remote control. Even
        though there is no direct contact between the finger pressing a button
        on the remote control and the appliance, since this is the normal way
        to turn on such appliances, it is forbidden just as manual activation
        is forbidden.
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. Is Using Electricity a Torah Prohibition or a Rabbinic Prohibition?
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not activate electrical appliances and devices such as
        telephones, microphones, alarms, doorbells, fans, air conditioners, and
        computers on Shabbat. Even if these appliances do not contain an
        incandescent filament or heating element and do not perform any of the
        39 <em>melakhot</em>, it is still forbidden to use them on Shabbat.
        Aĥaronim disagree, however, whether the prohibition is by Torah law or
        rabbinic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some maintain that using any electrical appliance violates the Torah
        prohibition of <em>Mav’ir</em>. They maintain that electricity has the
        same status as fire since, like fire, it has energy and power that can
        be harnessed. Rav Kook favors this position, arguing that the key
        aspect of fire is not its appearance, but rather its power to
        illuminate, heat, and provide power. Indeed, the Sages state that there
        are different types of fire (<em>Yoma</em> 21b), including some that do
        not burn and destroy. One example of this is the fire that Moshe saw at
        the burning bush (Rav Kook, <em>Oraĥ Mishpat</em> §71). R. Uziel agrees
        with this approach, adding that turning on electricity is also
        prohibited as a form of <em>Metaken Mana</em> since activating an
        electrical appliance renders it useful (<em>Mishpetei Uziel</em>, OĤ
        2:36:2). <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> (OĤ 50:9) maintains that turning on an
        electrical appliance is prohibited on account of <em>Boneh</em>,
        because completing a circuit creates a <em>kli</em>: when electricity
        flows through a device, an electrical wire within comes to life and
        activates the device. Thus, one who completes a circuit builds an
        implement, and one who breaks a circuit demolishes it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many others maintain, however, that using electrical appliances that do
not contain an incandescent filament and do not perform one of the 39        <em>melakhot</em> is only prohibited rabbinically, as it is considered
        a weekday activity. Additionally, some maintain that turning on
        appliances is prohibited because it is creating a new entity on Shabbat
(<em>Molid</em>), as it creates a new electrical current in the wires (        <em>Beit Yitzĥak</em>). No Torah prohibition is involved, because there
        is no "fire" in appliances without an incandescent filament. There is
        no problem of <em>Boneh</em>, because an electrical circuit cannot be
        considered a <em>kli</em>, that is, an implement or receptacle. This is
        the opinion of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<em>Minĥat Shlomo</em>
        1:9-12) and R. Eliezer Waldenberg (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 1:20:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, <em>le-khatĥila</em> we defer to the opinion that using
        electricity is a Torah prohibition. In times of need, when there are
        additional reasons to be lenient, we rely upon those who believe that
        using electricity is only a rabbinic violation.

        3. Electrical Appliances That Produce Sound (Telephones and
        Microphones)
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, the prohibition on using electrical appliances on
        Shabbat includes microphones and telephones.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if a phone is in use before Shabbat, or if a microphone is turned
        on before Shabbat, one may not speak on the phone or use a microphone
        on Shabbat, because doing so increases the electric current running
        through it and violates a Torah or rabbinic prohibition. In addition,
        the Sages banned <em>hashma’at kol</em> (producing sound) with an
        object specifically designed for this purpose. Many maintain that one
        who speaks into a microphone transgresses this prohibition (based on
        Rema 338:1). Furthermore, using a microphone resembles a weekday
        activity. It also may seem to belittle Shabbat, as those who hear the
        amplified sound are likely to think that the microphone was activated
        on Shabbat (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 3:55).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, one who is hard of hearing may use an electric hearing
        aid that rests on or inside the ear on Shabbat as long as it is turned
        on before Shabbat and he does not adjust the volume on Shabbat. When he
        wants to go to sleep, he should remove the device without shutting it
        off. In the morning, he may put it back in without turning it on.
        Although we stated that one may not use a microphone or telephone
        because speaking into it increases the electric current, this
        prohibition applies only when someone speaks directly into them.
        However, when speaking normally, the activation of the device in the
        wearer’s ear is secondary and therefore a form of <em>grama</em>, which
        is permitted when truly necessary. Furthermore, there is no problem of
        producing sound on Shabbat or belittling Shabbat since the sound is
        heard only by the wearer.
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as one may not turn on a microphone before Shabbat with the
        intention of using it on Shabbat, so is leaving on an intercom over
        Shabbat to hear the voices of people coming to visit, or to hear what
        is going on in the children’s room. To be sure, if one simply speaks
        normally in the room and not directly into the intercom, the
        prohibition is less severe since it is then a case of <em>grama</em>.
        It is nevertheless prohibited, because it is a weekday activity, it
        belittles Shabbat, and it produces sound with an object designed for
        that purpose. However, if the intercom was accidentally left on over
        Shabbat, as long as one does not intend to use it he may speak in a
        normal fashion in the room with the intercom.

    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Elevators
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not operate an elevator on Shabbat. Pressing the elevator
        buttons involves Torah prohibitions or, minimally, rabbinic
        prohibitions. However, some "Shabbat elevators" are set to operate
        automatically, meaning that they are set before Shabbat to stop on
        every floor or every other floor, at which point the doors open on
        their own for a predetermined amount of time and then close on their
        own. The elevator then continues on its way. There is a difference of
        opinion among the <em>poskim</em> regarding these elevators.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some prohibit using a Shabbat elevator, maintaining that using it is a
        weekday activity. Additionally, entering the elevator causes its motor
to use more electricity when the elevator goes up and down (<em>Ĥelkat Yaakov</em>, OĤ §144; <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 3:60;        <em>Ĥut Shani</em> vol. 1, p. 206; R. Shmuel Wosner).
    </p>
    <p>
        Others maintain that one may go up in a Shabbat elevator but not down.
        This is because when the elevator goes down, the extra weight helps
        produce electricity. Thus one who rides the elevator has a hand in
generating electricity (R. Levi Yitzĥak Halperin,        <em>Ma’aliyot Be-Shabbat</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        A third opinion maintains that a Shabbat elevator may be used. Since
        the settings are in place before Shabbat, and no action needs to be
        taken on Shabbat to make the elevator work, there is no prohibition.
        The fact that the elevator has a system that determines the weight of
        the passenger, which in turn tells the motor how much power to use, and
        even makes use of the additional weight to produce electricity, is of
        no interest to the rider. As long as the elevator goes up and down
        according to its settings, the passenger does not care about the
        elevator’s electricity-conserving mechanisms. Therefore, the actions
        caused indirectly by his entry into the elevator are not attributable
to him at all (it is a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> via        <em>grama</em>; this is the position of R. Yosef Eliyahu Henkin; R.
        Isser Yehuda Unterman; R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in SSK 23:58; Prof.
Ze’ev Lev in <em>Teĥumin</em> 2; and R. Yisrael Rosen in        <em>Teĥumin</em> 5.)
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, the lenient position is the primary one, while those who
        are stringent are commendable. In a case of need, even those who are
        normally stringent may be lenient. Those who are lenient must be
        careful not to enter or exit the Shabbat elevator when the door is
        about to close, so as to avoid causing it to reopen. Even for those who
        are lenient, it is better if the automatic system is programmed under
        the supervision of an organization that specializes in <em>halakha</em>
        and technology, as this can help ensure that entering the elevator does
        not turn on a light or the like and minimize the prohibitions involved
        according to the stringent view.

        5. Using Electricity that Was Produced on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Power supply is a vital need of the State of Israel all week, including
        Shabbat. Interrupting or impairing the supply can endanger human life.
        Hospitals are full of devices that depend on the supply of power, and
        even in private homes there are people who are dangerously ill who rely
        on electrical devices to stay alive. Police officers and security
        forces use electrical equipment, and without electricity they would be
        unable to respond properly to emergencies. On cold days, many homes are
        heated using electricity. If the electricity were to be withheld on
        Shabbat, babies and sick people would likely be at risk. Very hot days
        can also pose a certain risk for those who are ill and require air
        conditioning. In addition, since nowadays we store food for an extended
        amount of time in refrigerators and freezers, this food may spoil if
        the electricity is cut off. In a large population, some would likely
        contract food poisoning, which can be life-threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, it is necessary for the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) -
        whose employees are predominantly Jewish - to supply electricity
        nonstop, even on Shabbat. If there is some impairment to the supply of
        electricity in a particular location, whatever is needed to fix it must
        be done. Since technicians may fix the grid on Shabbat, everyone may
        benefit from the electricity that is subsequently generated, even
        though it was restored on Shabbat. The only exception is if a power
        outage takes place in a small area where it is known for certain that
        there is no risk to human life involved, in which case the repair may
        not be made on Shabbat. If it was nevertheless repaired by Jews on
        Shabbat, one may not benefit from the electricity until an hour after
        Shabbat. (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, quoted in SSK ch. 32 n. 182;
        below, 26:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        Much to our dismay, it is known that IEC workers perform activities on
        Shabbat that are not essential to guaranteeing the electricity supply,
        but that are for the purpose of saving money. Furthermore, if there
        were greater awareness of Shabbat observance, it would be possible to
        automate the entire electricity-generating system and eliminate the
        need for human intervention without extra expenses. It would only be
        necessary to have a few workers in the power stations, monitoring the
        system and troubleshooting emergencies. However, since in fact the IEC
        does not try to avoid performing <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat, several
        leading rabbis ruled that one should not use its electricity on Shabbat
        (but rather use a local generator) to avoid benefiting from Shabbat
        desecration or supporting it in any way. (See <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>, OĤ
        38:4.)
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, though, this electricity may be used on Shabbat, even in
        Israel. It is true that the IEC could take measures before Shabbat to
        avoid some of the Shabbat violations. Nevertheless, when its
        technicians do what is necessary to guarantee the electricity supply,
        they are not desecrating Shabbat, since electricity is necessary for
        people to live. Because of this, everyone may benefit from the
electricity. Since the consumers do not benefit from the        <em>melakhot </em>performed by the IEC technicians for the sole purpose
        of saving money, and from their perspective it would be better if the
        procedures were automated, they may benefit from the electricity on
Shabbat (see <em>Ha-ĥashmal Ba-halakha</em> vol. 2 ch. 1;        <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:24:1). We have recently learned of efforts to
        automate the grid and prevent Shabbat desecration.
    </p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. Timers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Shabbat prohibitions become forbidden at the onset of Shabbat, but
        before Shabbat begins, one may take actions whose effects will continue
        into Shabbat. A prominent example of this is using a timer ("Shabbos
        clock"). Such timers are connected to the power supply and to an
        appliance, and its settings control the flow of electricity,
        determining when the device will turn on and off. This is how,
        nowadays, we can set electric lights to go on and off over the course
        of Shabbat. One may leave on lights before Shabbat and set the timer to
        turn them off at bedtime, on again at lunch time, and off again for the
        afternoon before turning on again for <em>se’uda shlishit</em>.
        Similarly, one can use a timer to turn on an electric oven or fan,
        setting it so that the appliance will go on and off at the desired
        times.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one sets a timer to turn off the lights at 11 PM, but then decides
        that he would like to study Torah until midnight, some say that he may
        not delay the time that the lights will be extinguished by adjusting
        the timer’s settings, as in their opinion, the timer is an integral
        part of the lighting system, and the Sages forbade taking any action
        that effects a change in the duration of the lights’ operation. This
        can be inferred from the talmudic case of attaching an oil-filled
        container to an oil lamp, which the Sages forbid out of concern that
one might remove some of the oil on Shabbat (<em>Shabbat</em> 29b;        <em>Beitza</em> 22:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Others, including R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, offer a different
        perspective. They maintain that delaying the time the lights will go
        out is comparable to the case of one who is sitting in a room with a
        lit oil lamp. If the wind starts to blow though his window, threatening
        to extinguish the light, everyone agrees that he may close the window,
        even though this allows the lamp to burn longer. Since he is not doing
        anything to the lamp itself, but merely preventing the wind from
        blowing it out, there is no prohibition. Similarly, one who extends the
        settings of a timer is not doing anything to the light itself or to the
        electrical appliance, but merely preventing the timer from turning them
        off. Assuming that this action is permitted, the switches on the timer
        are not <em>muktzeh</em>, and they may be adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the rationale of those who are lenient is compelling and also
        accords with the widespread practice, one may rely on their opinion
        even <em>le-khatĥila</em>. Therefore, one may take action to extend the
        current state of affairs. If the electricity is off, one may extend the
        time that it will remain off and have the lights go on later. If the
        electricity is on, he may lengthen the time that it will remain on, and
        have the lights go out later. Similarly, if the lights are off, one can
        move the light switch to the off position, so that when the timer
        eventually restores the power, those lights will not go back on (SSK
        13:26-33).
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, one may not change the timer so that lights or appliances will
        go on or off earlier. For example, if the timer was set so that the
        lights would go off at midnight, but it turns out that people want to
        go to sleep earlier, one may not adjust the timer’s settings to make
        the lights go off earlier. Although he is not turning them off directly
        because his actions will not have any effect until later, nevertheless
        indirectly causing lights to go off is rabbinically forbidden.
        Similarly, if the timer was set to turn the lights on at 10 AM, it may
        not be adjusted to make the lights come on earlier, as indirectly
        causing lights to go on is rabbinically prohibited.

    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Thermostat Controls
    </h2>
    <p>
        The laws of thermostat controls are the same as those of an electric
        timer. Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that one may not adjust a
        thermostat. According to R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and others, one may
        change the setting if it will lead to the extension of the current
        state.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if one set the thermostat of an electric oil-filled
        radiator to medium before Shabbat, but on Shabbat realizes that it is
        hotter than he had expected, he may lower the setting of the thermostat
        once it has switched the radiator off. Thus, he ensures that the
        radiator will remain off for a longer period of time, and the heating
        element will work for a shorter period of time. However, one may not
        lower the thermostat while the radiator is on, because this changes the
        current state by causing the heating element to cycle off sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
        If, during the course of Shabbat, one wants a radiator to stay on for
        longer, he must wait until the radiator has cycled on, and the
temperature of the radiator has reached at least        <em>yad soledet bo</em> (at least 71 degrees Celsius). Then he may turn
        up the thermostat so that the radiator will stay on for longer.
However, if he does this when the temperature is below        <em>yad soledet</em> <em>bo</em>, he transgresses <em>Bishul</em>,
        because he is causing the oil inside the radiator to heat up. Once the
        radiator has cycled off, it is not permissible under any circumstances
        to turn up the thermostat, because this will change the current state
        and may lead to the radiator turning on immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same rules apply to air conditioners and refrigerators that have
        manual thermostats. When the compressor has cycled on, one may turn
        down the temperature, which will keep the refrigerator or air
        conditioner on longer. When the compressor has cycled off, one may turn
up the temperature, which will keep the machine off longer (        <em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> §10; SSK 23:24).
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, all of this assumes that there is no display recording the
        temperature. However, if the thermostat is adjusted by pressing buttons
        to change the temperature, and this is shown in an electronic display
        (as is the case with many air conditioners), then it is prohibited,
        both on account of <em>Kotev</em>, and because each press of a button
        makes direct use of electricity.
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. Opening a Refrigerator or Oven, and Entering an Air-Conditioned Room
    </h2>
    <p>
        If opening the door of a refrigerator causes an electrical event to
        occur, one may not open the door on Shabbat. Most refrigerators have an
        electric light inside that goes on automatically when the refrigerator
        door is opened. Thus, if the light has not been removed before Shabbat,
        one may not open the refrigerator on Shabbat. There are also
        refrigerators where a fan turns on or off whenever the door is opened.
        These refrigerators and any with similar electrical mechanisms may not
        be opened on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, if it has been ensured that opening the refrigerator will
        not turn anything on or off, one may open the door on Shabbat. Indeed,
        some permit opening a refrigerator when the compressor has cycled on
        but prohibit opening the refrigerator when the compressor is off, as
        opening the door causes warm air to enter the refrigerator. Since the
        compressor is activated by an internal thermostat, opening the
        refrigerator may cause the compressor to go on immediately, or at least
        sooner than it would have otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in practice one may open the refrigerator even when the
        compressor is off. There are a number of reasons for this. First, it is
        unintentional: The person opening the door does not intend to turn on
        the compressor. Second, it is uncertain whether opening the door will
        cause the compressor to turn on, as it is possible that the compressor
        was about to cycle on anyway. Third, even if opening the door does
cause the compressor to cycle on, this was only done indirectly, via        <em>grama</em>,<em> </em>as opening the door does not itself turn on
        the compressor. It simply causes warm air to enter, which may in turn
        affect the compressor. Accordingly, one does not need to worry about a
        case where there is uncertainty regarding <em>grama </em>combined with
        lack of intent.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the same reason, one may drink cold water from a water cooler
        without checking whether or not the compressor has cycled on. One may
        also enter a room that has a working air conditioner that is controlled
        by a thermostat, even though opening the door may cause the air
        conditioner to cycle on. First, it is not certain that opening the door
        will cause the air conditioner to cycle on. Even if it does cycle on,
        this was accomplished via <em>grama</em>. Similarly, one may open a
        door or window in a room that has a thermostat-regulated heater or air
        conditioner. This is because the person opening the door or window does
        not intend to affect the machine, it is not certain that opening the
        door or window will in fact do so, and if the machine is affected it
        will have been accomplished through <em>grama</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, many are stringent regarding an oven that is controlled by a
        thermostat and will not open such an oven when the heating element has
        cycled off. Since it is a small appliance, opening the door is more
        likely to cause it to cycle on. To avoid this problem, some ovens have
        a Shabbat setting in which the oven produces a steady heat and does not
        respond to a thermostat. When the oven is on this setting, all agree
        that it may be opened and shut at will.

        9. When the Refrigerator Light Bulb was not Disconnected
    </h2>
    <p>
        If one did not remove or disable the light bulb of a refrigerator
        before Shabbat, he may not open or close the door on Shabbat, as this
        will turn the light on or off. If one needs the food in the
        refrigerator for Shabbat, he may seek the help of a nearby non-Jew. In
        order to avoid the prohibition of benefiting from a <em>melakha </em>
        performed by a non-Jew, one should offer him food from the
        refrigerator, at which point he will open the door for his own benefit.
        Once the non-Jew has opened the refrigerator for himself, the Jew may
        take whatever he needs out of the refrigerator as well. Although
        generally one may not ask a non-Jew to perform a <em>melakha</em> on
        Shabbat, here one is not asking him to perform a <em>melakha</em>.
        Rather, one is asking him to open the refrigerator, which also happens
        to turn on the light. Afterward, in order to continue opening and
        closing the refrigerator permissibly, one may ask the non-Jew to remove
        the bulb, because turning off electric lights is only prohibited
        rabbinically, and one may ask a non-Jew to transgress a rabbinic
        prohibition for the sake of Shabbat (above 9:11; below 25:2, 5).
    </p>
    <p>
        If no non-Jew is available, and the food is truly needed, then when the
compressor has cycled off, the refrigerator may be unplugged using a        <em>shinui</em>, such as by prying the plug out of the socket using a
        thin piece of wood or plastic. Since the plug is <em>muktzeh</em>, it
        may not be moved in the normal fashion (below 23:14).
        <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        In a case where one is uncertain whether or not the bulb was removed,
        many <em>poskim</em> maintain that one may open the refrigerator.
        First, he does not intend to turn on the light, but only to open the
refrigerator. If the light does go on, it is a case of        <em>psik reisha</em> - he is performing a permitted action, and a
        second prohibited action takes place collaterally - which is normally
        prohibited. However, since the prohibited action might not occur, this
        is a case of an uncertain (<em>safek</em>) <em>psik reisha</em>, which
        is not prohibited. Although some are stringent in such cases, the
        lenient position is the primary one.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the refrigerator was opened and the light went on, food that is
        needed may be removed. The refrigerator should not be closed. Rather, a
        towel or some other object should be positioned in a way that prevents
        the refrigerator from closing and turning off the light. This way, the
        refrigerator can also be reopened.

        10. Dishwashers
    </h2>
    <p>
        A dishwasher may not be activated on Shabbat. This is because one may
        not use electricity, and additionally because the dishwasher heats
water to wash the dishes. This heating is a transgression of        <em>Bishul</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who always clears off dirty dishes from the table and places them
        directly in the dishwasher may do so on Shabbat as well. Then after
        Shabbat he can run the dishwasher. However, if he does not generally do
        this, then he may not do so on Shabbat, as it would amount to preparing
        on Shabbat for the weekdays, which is forbidden.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not even turn on a dishwasher via a timer, because the
        dishwasher is designed so that it will not go on unless the door is
        closed. This means that the person who closes the door to the
        dishwasher after the dishes have been loaded causes it to turn on (SSK
        12:37). However, in times of need, when there will be a great need to
        wash many dishes on Shabbat and it would be extremely difficult to wash
        them by hand, one may set the dishwasher with a timer. This is because
        causing it to turn on by closing the door is considered <em>grama</em>.
Since an action performed via <em>grama</em> is not a true<em>melakha</em>, in times of need it is permitted (above 9:9;        <em>Responsa</em> <em>Me-rosh Tzurim</em> §30).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one can disable the system that makes the dishwasher’s activation
        dependent on closing the door, so that the dishwasher will go on at the
        set time even if the door is not shut, then even in ordinary
        circumstances one may load the dirty dishes and have the dishwasher
        wash them during Shabbat (R. Yeĥiel Faust, <em>Le-ohavai Yesh</em> 1).
    </p>
    <a name="11"></a><h2>
        11. Automatic Doors
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not approach a door that automatically opens when it senses
        someone near it. One who does so is viewed as directly triggering the
        electricity that opens the door. It is immaterial whether the system
        works through floor sensors, an electric eye, a motion detector, or the
        like. As we have seen (section 2), according to many, including Rav
        Kook, turning on an electrical appliance is prohibited by Torah law.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who finds himself in a hotel or hospital with automatic doors must
        find an alternative way to enter that does not involve using
        electricity. If a non-Jew approaches the door in order to enter, a Jew
        may follow him in (below 25:1-2). But if the person approaching the
        door is a Jew who does not observe Shabbat, a Shabbat observer may not
        follow him in, because the Shabbat observer may not benefit from the
        Shabbat desecration of a fellow Jew. Furthermore, when an observant Jew
        takes advantage of Shabbat desecration and benefits from it, it is
        considered a desecration of God’s name. Even though some are lenient in
        this case, it is proper to be stringent. Only under pressing
        circumstances, when there is no alternative, may one rely on those who
        are lenient.
        <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Doctors and nurses may enter a hospital through an automatic door, as
        their work entails saving lives. Others may then follow them through
        the door. Ideally, the hospital administration should try to minimize
        the need for Shabbat desecration and arrange alternative entrances for
        visitors and staff to enter without activating any electrical devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some say that if one unintentionally came too close to an automatic
        door, thus causing it to open, he must remain in place, because moving
        away will cause the door to close. They maintain that he should wait
        until a non-Jew arrives and ask the non-Jew to stand near him, at which
        point he can leave. Afterward, when the non-Jew leaves as well, the
        non-Jew will be the one who causes the door to close. However, if
        remaining in place causes the Jew anguish, he may simply leave, as he
        is just walking normally and does not care if the door is open or
closed. His act of leaving is a <em>psik</em>        <em>reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> brought about via <em>grama</em>, which
        is not forbidden. Even if the person who mistakenly caused the
        automatic door to open did in fact want to enter, in a time of need he
        may still enter, since the <em>melakha </em>was unintentional. In
        contrast, if he intended for the door to open but forgot, and only
        later remembered, that it is forbidden, he should not enter, because
        one may not benefit from a <em>melakha</em> that was unknowingly
        (albeit intentionally) performed on Shabbat (SA 318:1; see n. 11 above
        and 26:4 below).

    <a name="12"></a><h2>
        12. When Entering a Room Causes the Lights to Turn On
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not enter a room where doing so automatically turns on the
        lights or air conditioning. While one might claim that he did not
        intend to turn on the lights or air conditioning by entering the room,
        the fact is that everyone knows how the system works in such places.
    </p>
    <p>
        This problem is common in hotel rooms and bathrooms. One who stays in
        such a hotel must make sure that the system is switched off before
        Shabbat. If he did not take care of this in advance and is outside his
        room when Shabbat begins, he may ask a non-Jew to open the door for
        him. He should further ask the non-Jew to stay for a bit so that the
        non-Jew will benefit from the lights or air conditioning, since he is
        then viewed as having turned them on for his own sake, and the Jew may
        then benefit from them (below, 25:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        What if the hotel guest is inside such a room when Shabbat begins, and
        he knows that if he leaves he will cause the lights or air conditioning
        to shut off? If he can easily stay inside until after Shabbat, or if a
        non-Jew is due to come shortly to disable the system, it is preferable
        to wait inside. However, if doing so causes him anguish, he may leave
        the room or bathroom because the purpose of this system is to save the
        hotel money by conserving electricity. The hotel guest does not care
        about that, so it is a case of <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em>
        regarding a rabbinic prohibition (since all agree that the prohibition
        of turning off the lights or air conditioning is rabbinic). When
        necessary, in such a case, one may be lenient (above, ch. 9 n. 2).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, as we saw earlier, once the guest has left his room he will
        not be able to return to it, because doing so will turn on the lights
        and air conditioning. The only way for him to re-enter would be with
        the help of a non-Jew. Therefore, the proper course of action in this
        case is to ask a non-Jew to disable the system. Then the guest will be
        able to enter and exit the room as needed.

        13. Intercoms, Security Monitors, and Doorbells at Building Entrances
    </h2>
    <p>
        Some buildings use closed-circuit television (CCTV), in which
        surveillance cameras transmit images to monitors. A non-Jewish security
        guard stationed at the entrance keeps an eye on the people who come and
        go by watching the monitors. When people whom the guard recognizes as
        residents of the building or their guests arrive at the front door, he
        pushes an electric button that unlocks the door, allowing them to
        enter. Since this system is beneficial to the Jewish residents and
        guests of the building, a Jew may not stand where his image will be
        captured on the monitor. Similarly, if a Jew wishes to enter the
        building, he may not press the intercom button to request that the
        guard unlock the door for him, since using electricity is prohibited.
        <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, one should make certain that the place where the guard sits
        is not far from the front door. Then, when a Jew wishes to enter, he
        can knock on the door while standing out of camera range, so that the
        guard can see him and unlock the door for him. If the non-Jew elects to
        open it using the electric release button, the Jew may still enter,
        since it is also possible for the non-Jew to open the door manually. If
        the non-Jew prefers to use the door release button, he is doing so for
        his own convenience, and not for the benefit of the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there is a non-Jew entering the building at the same time as the
        Jew, even if the non-Jew makes use of the electricity, the Jew can
        follow him in, since the non-Jew is doing this for his own benefit. If
        it is a non-observant Jew who makes use of the electricity in order to
enter, one may not follow him in, since he may not benefit from        <em>melakha</em> done by a fellow Jew on Shabbat. Additionally, this
        constitutes a desecration of God’s name. Although some are lenient in
        this regard, it is proper to be stringent. Only under pressing
        circumstances, when there is no alternative, may one rely on those who
        are lenient (as explained above, ch. 11 n. 11).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one wishes to enter a building, but no one inside the building hears
        him knocking and calling out, may he ring an electric doorbell to gain
        admission? Some maintain that under pressing circumstances one may ring
        the bell using a <em>shinui</em>, while others forbid this. Under
        pressing circumstances, when there is no other solution, one who wishes
        to may rely on the lenient opinion provided that this leniency is not
        used regularly, as doing so regularly belittles Shabbat.

        14. Motion Detectors in Public Domains and in the Home
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may walk where security cameras record images of passersby. Since
        the pedestrian has no interest in being videoed, he is not held
        responsible for his image being recorded, and there is no prohibition.
        Similarly, one may pass through a metal detector, since one who goes
        through is not interested in its electrical activity. One may also walk
        on a street where there are motion detectors that detect the movements
        of passersby. Even if a security system turns a light on when it senses
        movement, one may walk past it, because he is innocently walking
        through and is not interested in turning on the light. However, if it
        is not difficult, it is preferable to use an alternate route, since
        indirectly causing an electric light to go on is not properly
        respectful of Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        A private home might have a security system in which the burglar alarm
        has been disarmed, but the sensors continue working. Consequently,
        whenever one passes by certain places, LED security lights go on, or
        images are recorded. Some forbid walking around in such a house on
        Shabbat since doing so will cause electrical activity. They maintain
        that if one wishes to walk there, he must either disable the entire
        system or cover all the sensors so they will not detect a person’s
movements. (See R. Mordechai Eliyahu,        <em>She’elot U-teshuvot Ha-Rav Ha-Rashi</em>, 5750-5753, p. 174.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Others permit walking there. This is because one simply wishes to walk,
        and has no interest in triggering sensors or having his image captured;
        the only reason he does not deactivate them is because it is so
        difficult to do (<em>Si’aĥ Naĥum</em> §25). This is the primary
        position. Nevertheless, if possible, it is preferable to disable the
        sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
        One must disable a light that automatically turns on when one
        approaches the entrance to one’s house, because he benefits from the
        light in this case. Even if he does not benefit, it is not properly
        respectful to Shabbat to cause the light to go on. In a case of need,
        when the system is activated and there is no other way to enter the
        house, one can crawl through in such a way that the light might not
        turn on. Even if it is almost certain that the light will still turn
        on, turning it on by crawling constitutes a <em>shinui</em>.
        Additionally, he should keep his eyes closed so that he will not
        benefit from the light when it goes on.
    </p>
    <a name="15"></a><h2>
        15. Security Systems
    </h2>
    <p>
        When a home security system is necessary for protection against
        thieves, there are two possible ways to set it up in a halakhically
        acceptable fashion. The best way is to use a timer. One may set the
        timer to arm the system during the hours when people are in bed or out
        of the house and disarm the system during the hours when people are
        awake and going in and out of the house. The problem with this is that
        if schedules change, the system needs to be changed, and if doing this
        involves using electricity, it is absolutely forbidden on Shabbat. If
        the system has an external timer, one may extend the current state, as
        explained above (section 6; under pressing circumstances one may also
        shorten the time, as explained in n. 7).
    </p>
    <p>
The second possibility is to use a special key that works via        <em>grama</em>. Such a key disarms the security system when turned in
        one direction and arms it when turned in the other direction. To avoid
        transgression, the key must not cause any immediate electrical
        activity. Rather, it activates a mechanism that will eventually
        activate or disconnect electricity powering the alarm. Even though
        performing <em>melakha</em> through <em>grama</em> is normally
        prohibited <em>le-khatĥila</em>, when the only alternative will result
        in loss, one may be lenient.
        <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Another question regarding security systems relates to monitoring
        services. In many cases, if a burglar alarms for a home or a car is
        triggered, the system signals a central monitoring station. Operators
        at the station see the signal and contact the owner to find out what
        happened. If the owner does not answer, the operators dispatch security
        personnel to apprehend the thieves. May one maintain a security system
        that involves such a service?
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are stringent and require the owner to demand that the monitoring
        service refrain from desecrating Shabbat on his behalf. This approach
        would require the service to use non-Jewish security personnel on
        Shabbat. Others permit using a monitoring service even if it is staffed
        by Jews, maintaining that every theft nowadays involves an element of
        danger to human life. Therefore one may hire a service that employs and
        sends out Jewish security personnel on Shabbat. In practice, it is
        proper to use a company that tries to use non-Jewish security personnel
        on Shabbat. If that is not an option, one may use a company that is not
        particular in this regard. If the alarm goes off and the service calls
        to find out if a dispatch is necessary, even if the personnel are
        non-Jews, one should answer the phone, in order to prevent them from
        making an unnecessary trip.

        16. Turning Off an Alarm That Went Off on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        If an alarm goes off on Shabbat because one touched one’s car or
        entered one’s house carelessly, what should be done? If the alarm goes
        off during the day and will stop relatively soon, one may not take any
        action to turn it off. However, what if it will continue to make noise
        for an extended period during the day or for even a short period at
        night? If the alarm disturbs people and causes them anguish because it
        prevents them from sleeping, sets them on edge, and ruins their
enjoyment of Shabbat, one may turn it off, as long as one does so via a        <em>shvut di-shvut</em> (above 9:11). This is because turning off the
        alarm is only prohibited rabbinically (see section 1 above), so if one
        turns it off with a <em>shinui</em> such as by pressing the appropriate
        button on the remote control with a spoon or the back of his finger,
        then the action taken is considered a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. Even if
        turning off the alarm will make a light go on temporarily, since he
does not need this light, it is considered a        <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> (above 9:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is true that some forbid this, only allowing one to be lenient if a
        non-Jew is available to turn off the alarm. For one who follows this
        position, if his non-observant Jewish neighbors threaten to call the
        police (which will lead to additional Shabbat desecration), he should
        tell the neighbors where the remote control is. Then the neighbors can
choose to turn the alarm off themselves rather than call the police (        <em>Melakhim Omnayikh</em> 10:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in practice, since this is a case of great necessity for the
sake of a mitzva, one may turn off the alarm via a        <em>shvut di-shvut</em> (see <em>Be-ohalah shel Torah</em>, OĤ §23; R.
        Dov Lior in R. Moshe Harari’s <em>Kedushat Ha-Shabbat</em> vol. 1, p.
        303).

        17. Alarm Clocks, Watches, and Digital Photo Frames
    </h2>
    <p>
        If an electric alarm clock goes off on Shabbat, one may not turn it
        off, because doing so involves the use of electricity. If the noise is
        disturbing, the clock may be wrapped in blankets and moved where it
        will not be heard. If there is no way to minimize the noise, and the
        ringing is so loud that it is difficult to rest, one may turn off the
alarm using a <em>shinui</em>. This follows the principle that a        <em>shvut di-shvut</em> is permitted for the sake of a mitzva (as
        explained in the previous section).
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the alarm actually goes off, one may press a button to
        deactivate it. Similarly, one may move an analog clock’s hands in order
        to delay the time that the alarm will go off. However, one may change
        the time to an earlier time only for the sake of a mitzva or when there
        is a great need (above, 6:7). One may not change the time if it
        involves typing words or digits or any other use of electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may wear an electronic watch that displays the time. Even if there
        is a computer inside, one may wear it, since its primary purpose -
        displaying the time - is permitted (below, 22:8). However, if one knows
        that he is likely to end up using the computer, he may not wear this
        watch on Shabbat. Of course, one may not wear a watch that requires him
        to press a button to see the time, as it is <em>muktzeh</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not wear a watch that measures the room temperature and
        displays it, because the movements of the wearer cause the watch to
        work. The claim that one is not interested in this feature is patently
        false; if this were the case such watches would not be made, and if
        they were made, no one would buy them. However, if the watch detects
        the temperature but does not display it unless one presses the
        appropriate button, one may wear the watch. The reason is that the
measurement is done via <em>grama</em>, and it is a case of a        <em>psik reisha </em>where the person is indifferent toward the result
        (see above, ch. 9 n. 3).

        Some are stringent and avoid wearing a solar-powered watch or an
        automatic quartz watch that is powered by movement. They are concerned
        that whenever the wearer moves his hand or enters a well-lit place, he
        causes the watch to recharge. Others are lenient on condition that the
        watch would be able to function for a few days without being charged,
        so that the charging that takes place on Shabbat is not really
        necessary. One who wishes may be lenient, and one who is stringent
        should be commended.

        A digital photo frame, which stays on all week and cycles through a
        slideshow of family pictures or scenic views, does not need to be
        turned off before Shabbat. This is because everyone knows that it is
        automatic and is on nonstop throughout the week.
    </p>

        18. <em>Grama</em> Solutions to Halakhic Problems on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Several organizations specialize in <em>halakha</em> and technology,
devoting themselves to engineering electrical appliances to turn on via        <em>grama</em> so that they may be used in cases of need. One such
        method is called "removing an impediment" (<em>hasarat ha-mone’a</em>).
        A second method uses a type of scanner that performs a scan every few
        seconds and turns an appliance on if it determines that a switch has
        been flipped. Thus, flipping the switch does not turn on the appliance
        but only causes it to be turned on indirectly. A third method is based
        on the principle that one may extend the present state: the appliance
        is set to turn on for one second every few seconds. When the switch is
        flipped, the next time the appliance turns on, it will not turn off
        after a second but will remain activated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others maintain that one may not use any of these clever stratagems. If
        an appliance is set to be activated electronically, causing its
        activation is not considered <em>grama</em> but the normal way of
        activating it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, it would seem that if one’s action causes an appliance to
        turn on within a short time, like it would be turned on during the
week, then even if the appliance has been programmed to turn on in a        <em>grama</em>-like way, one may not turn it on. The internal workings
        of the machine are not important; if it turns on in a way that looks
        normal, then that is not considered <em>grama</em>. Therefore,
        elevators and automatic doors may not be turned on via <em>grama</em>;
        since the goal is for them to function in their normal way soon after
        being turned on, it would not be considered <em>grama</em>. Similarly,
        one may not travel using a "<em>kalno’it</em>" (an electrical
        wheelchair or gold cart<em> </em>specially designed for use by the
        sick, disabled, and elderly on Shabbat), since it operates in the way
        that one would operate a similar device during the week.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, when one’s action causes an appliance to turn on only with
        a significant delay, then if it is brought about indirectly - whether
        by <em>hasarat ha-mone’a</em>, scanning, or extending the present state
        - it is considered <em>grama</em>, and such a system may be used when
        needed. This is the practice regarding arming a security system: if
        turning a key will cause the system to work via <em>grama</em>, and it
        will only actually arm itself ten minutes after the key is turned, it
        is considered <em>grama</em>, and one may do so in cases of great need.

            According to Rav Kook, using electricity is prohibited on account
            of <em>Mav’ir</em>. Therefore, one may not speak into a microphone,
            as this increases the electric current. His responsa on the subject
are not so well known, since <em>Responsa</em>            <em>Oraĥ Mishpat</em>, in which they appear (§70-71) was printed in
            1979, thirty years after the main debates among contemporary
            Aĥaronim. At the time, Ĥazon Ish was inclined to say that use of
            electricity is prohibited by Torah law on account of <em>Boneh</em>
            , but many disagreed with him, including R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach
            and R. Eliezer Waldenberg. Nevertheless, other Aĥaronim share Rav
Kook’s opinion that the prohibition on electricity is due to<em>Mav’ir</em>. These include <em>Mishpetei Uziel</em>, OĤ<em> </em>2:36:2; <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> 5:38; <em>Brit Olam</em>,<em>Ha-mav’ir Ve-hamekhabeh</em> 1; R. Yosef Messas’s            <em>Responsa</em> <em>Mayim Ĥayim</em>, OĤ §134. Also see the entry
            on "<em>ĥashmal</em>" in the <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit</em>, which
            focuses on the opinions that disagree with Ĥazon Ish and maintain
            that the prohibition is rabbinic. One should be aware that
            according to Ĥazon Ish, if an appliance is already on, increasing
            the current to amplify the power of the appliance is not prohibited
            by Torah law. However, according to Rav Kook, who believes using
            electricity is prohibited because of <em>Mav’ir</em>, increasing
            the current is prohibited by Torah law as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many contemporary authorities accept the opinion of R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach that there is no Torah prohibition involved in
            using electricity. However, <em>le-khatĥila</em> they still take
            into account the opinion that maintains it is prohibited by Torah
            law (see <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 1:20; <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 2:112;
            and many additional works). <em>Igrot Moshe</em> (OĤ 3:42, 3:55,
            and 4:84) maintains that the status of the prohibition is unclear.
            In practice, although many state that in principle the prohibition
            on using electricity is rabbinic, in fact they relate to the
            prohibition of turning on electrical appliances as if it were
            prohibited by Torah law. Thus, even in cases of uncertainty and
            cases where electricity is required for the sake of a mitzva, to
            avoid substantial loss, or to help someone who is bothered by a
            minor illness, they are not lenient and prohibit using electricity
            via a non-Jew or when activated with a <em>shinui</em>, despite the
fact that each of these scenarios would constitute a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em> (see above 9:11). Only in cases of true
            necessity do they take into account the opinion that the
            prohibition is rabbinic. Therefore, the only way these appliances
            can be used on Shabbat is if they are turned on before Shabbat. In
            times of true necessity they can be used through <em>grama</em>
            (above 9:9), meaning that one’s actions will not directly or
            immediately cause the appliance to turn on. Examples of the
            permitted use of electricity on Shabbat include wearing a hearing
            aid (section 3 below) and adjusting the setting on a timer (as
            explained below in n. 6). For appliances that appear to work
            normally but have a built-in <em>grama</em> mechanism, see section
18 below. Regarding the use of computers, see below 18:1 and            <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            If a Jew in the United States who does not observe Shabbat calls a
            Jewish friend in Israel when Shabbat is over in Israel but while it
            is still Shabbat in the U.S., the latter may not speak with him,
            because he is benefiting from his friend’s Shabbat desecration.
            However, a Jew in Israel may speak with a non-Jew who calls him
            when it is Shabbat in the U.S., since a non-Jew is not obligated to

            There is no problem of <em>hashma’at kol</em> since the sound is
            only heard by the wearer of the device. The only problem is the
            electrical operations of the hearing aid. Indeed, some prohibit the
use of hearing aids (<em>Dovev Meisharim</em>,<em>Levushei Yom Tov</em> §15; R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv cited in            <em>Orĥot</em> <em>Shabbat</em> 26:23). However, in practice many
have permitted the hearing-impaired to use hearing aids, including            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:85. Those who maintain that turning on
            an electrical appliance without an incandescent filament is
            rabbinically prohibited because it creates a new flow of
            electricity in the wires do not view increasing the current as a
            new creative act. At worst, it might be deemed a weekday activity,
            in which case one may be lenient in the case of a great need.
            Similarly, for those who believe that turning on an appliance is
prohibited on account of <em>Boneh</em> or because it is creating a            <em>kli</em>, there is no problem here; since the hearing aid is
            already on, increasing the current creates nothing new. Based on
            these rationales, the following authorities permit the use of a
            hearing aid: R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 6:6;
            SSK 34:28; <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 1:19:19; <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em>
            2:17. See <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit</em> vol. 18, pp. 731-732. It
            is true that Rav Kook in <em>Oraĥ</em> <em>Mishpat</em> §71
            prohibits speaking into a microphone, because the speech causes
            electric current to flow. He explains that this cannot be
            considered <em>grama</em> since the result is direct and immediate.
            It seems, though, that since the sound waves resulting from normal
            speech are only converted to electric current once they reach the
            hearing aid, this can be considered <em>ko’aĥ</em> <em>sheni </em>
("secondary power"), a form of <em>grama</em>, as explained in            <em>San.</em> 77b and <em>Ĥullin</em> 16a. <em>Grama</em> is
permitted under pressing circumstances, as explained in            <em>Shabbat</em> 120a, SA 334:20, and Rema <em>ad loc.</em>; see
            above, 9:9.

            One who uses a microphone fully intends to speak into it, and this
is the normal way to amplify a voice, so it is not considered            <em>grama</em>. In contrast, if one simply speaks normally in a
            room that has a baby monitor and thereby projects his voice over
            the intercom, since this is not the normal way to converse and his
mouth is far from the intercom, it is considered            <em>ko’aĥ sheni </em>and thus <em>grama</em>, as in the case of a
hearing aid (though this requires further study; see            <em>Harĥavot</em>). However, since the sound can be heard in the
            room with the receiver, it is a weekday activity and belittles
            Shabbat. It might also be considered <em>hashma’at kol</em> (Rema
            338:1; <em>Oraĥ Mishpat</em> §71; also see Rema 252:5). In
            contrast, if the intercom was left on accidentally, then since one
            who speaks in that room is using it only via <em>grama</em>, and he
is not interested in making his voice heard, this is a case of            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in the case of a rabbinic
            prohibition, where one may be lenient in a case of need. In
            pressing circumstances, such as when one is sick, one may be
lenient and leave an intercom on. See <em>Terumat</em> <em>Ha</em>-            <em>goren</em> §79. <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> (vol. 5, pp. 403-405)
            permits this even <em>le-khatĥila</em>. One should only rely on
            this leniency under pressing circumstances.

            The lenient position is the primary one, as its reasoning is
            compelling. Furthermore, it does not seem reasonable to view
            entering an elevator as worse than <em>grama</em> (as this is not a
direct action but <em>ko’aĥ sheni</em>). Some are lenient even            <em>le-khatĥila</em> in a case of <em>grama</em> (<em>Taz</em>
            514:7). To be sure, most <em>poskim</em> permit <em>grama</em> only
            in cases of need (SA 334:22), but here the <em>grama</em> is
combined with a <em>psik reisha</em>, so it is permitted even            <em>le-khatĥila</em> (<em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> 1:10:6; see above 9:9
            and <em>Harĥavot</em>). In any case, even according to those who do
            not allow entering a Shabbat elevator, the prohibition is rabbinic,
since one who enters the elevator does not intend to do a            <em>melakha</em>. Since the <em>poskim</em> disagree, the law
            follows the principle that we are lenient in cases of doubt about a
            rabbinic rule.

            Some maintain that making any change to the settings of an electric
            timer is prohibited by Torah law (<em>Yaskil</em> <em>Avdi</em>
            7:23), while others maintain that only certain kinds of changes are
prohibited by Torah law (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, YD 3:47:4;            <em>Az Nidberu</em> 3:25 and 8:32). If this opinion is correct,
            then the problem of <em>muktzeh</em> also comes into play.
            Nevertheless, the logic of those who are lenient is very
            compelling, as explained in <em>Harĥavot</em>. First, the stringent
            position is based on the opinion of Rosh and those who follow him,
            with which many disagree (above ch. 16 n. 1). Second, it would seem
            that even Rosh would permit in this case, as the action of
            adjusting the timer is not done directly to the lights. Indeed, R.
            Shlomo Zalman Auerbach writes thus in <em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> §13,
            as does R. Ovadia Yosef in <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, OĤ 3:18.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be added that when the lights are off, one may increase
            the time they will remain off, even if they will go on in the
            interim period. In other words, if the lights are off during the
            night, and are set to go back on at 10 AM and turn off again at
            noon, one may adjust the timer so that the lights will go off at 11
            AM. The principle is that while the lights are off, one may cause
            them to be off for a longer period of time. This is true whether
            the current state is being extended, or whether the future state is
            being extended following a period when the lights will be on.
            Similarly, while the lights are on, one may cause them to be on for
            a longer period of time, even if in the interim they will turn off
            for a certain amount of time (SSK 13:30).

            This applies under normal circumstances. However, in cases of need,
            those who are lenient allow causing a timer to turn the lights on
            earlier. According to most <em>poskim</em>, using a timer is
considered <em>grama</em>, which some permit even            <em>le-khatĥila</em> (<em>Taz</em>), and most permit in times of
            need (as explained above 9:9). This is the position of R. Shlomo
Zalman Auerbach as cited in SSK 13:29, and of R. Ovadia Yosef in            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, OĤ 3:18. Therefore, when one is sick (even if
            he is not dangerously ill), if the lights are disturbing his sleep
            and the timer is set to turn off the lights in a couple of hours,
            the settings may be changed so that the lights will go out in half
            an hour instead. An additional reason to be lenient is that turning
            off lights is only a rabbinic prohibition (above, section 1). In a
            case of dire necessity, one may make the lights turn on earlier for
            the sake of a mitzva, such as if the lack of light would cause one
            to waste much time that would have been spent learning Torah. In
deference to the stringent position, however, it is proper to use a            <em>shinui</em> when making the adjustment.

As explained in 9:9 above, some permit <em>grama </em>even            <em>le-khatĥila</em>, while most only permit it in cases of need.
            Here, even if the act of opening the oven door will definitely turn
            on the heating element, since he does not intend to turn it on, it
            is simply a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em>, which is permitted
            even under normal circumstances. This point is even more relevant
            if it is possible that the oven would have cycled on even if left
            alone. In that case, opening the door accomplishes nothing. R.
Shlomo Zalman Auerbach writes this regarding a refrigerator (<em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> 1:10), as do R. Ovadia Yosef (<em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, OĤ 1:21) and R. Eliezer Waldenberg (            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 8:12). However, many recommend being
            stringent and opening the refrigerator only when the compressor is
            already on; only then is it impossible for opening the door to
            cause the compressor to turn on, as it is already on. Even though
            the influx of warm air will lead the compressor to stay on for
            longer, this is not prohibited (<em>Responsa</em> <em>Har Tzvi</em>
            , OĤ 1:151; <em>Ĥelkat Yaakov</em> 3:179). Nevertheless, the bottom
            line is that one may open a refrigerator without checking whether
            or not the compressor is on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The law regarding opening a refrigerator is more lenient than the
            law regarding opening an electric oven. There are two reasons for
            this distinction. First, an oven is small, and thus opening the
            door is likely to cause it to cycle on. There is a slight
            possibility that this would not be considered <em>grama</em>, but
            rather a direct action. In contrast, a refrigerator is large, and
            it is unlikely that opening the door will affect it immediately. If
this were to happen, it would definitely be considered            <em>grama</em>. Second, according to many <em>poskim</em>, turning
            on the refrigerator’s compressor is only a rabbinic prohibition,
            since there is no heating element (above, n. 1). In contrast,
            turning on the oven’s heating element is prohibited by Torah law
            according to all opinions. Reflecting this distinction, SSK 1:35 is
            stringent about opening the door of an electric oven, while when it
            comes to a refrigerator he records the lenient position as well. In
            contrast, <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> </em>OĤ 4:74, <em>Bishul</em>
            28 is lenient even in the case of an electric oven with a
            thermostat. He maintains that one may open the door even when the
oven has cycled off, because it is an uncertain<em>psik reisha </em>in the case of a rabbinic prohibition            <em> </em>(as it is performed via <em>grama</em>), and such a
            combination is permitted. Regarding opening the door of a room that
            has a radiator or air conditioner, almost no one is stringent.
            Since there is a relatively large distance between the door and the
            air conditioner or radiator, even those who are stringent would
            agree that this is considered <em>grama</em>. See above 10:17.

            SSK 10:14 permits one to pull the plug using a <em>shinui</em>, but
            only if it often plugged and unplugged. If this is not the case, he
            is concerned that unplugging it might qualify as <em>Soter</em>. In
            15:3 above I write that even if a particular appliance is not
            plugged and unplugged regularly, the law follows the majority of
            plugs (which are plugged and unplugged regularly), and we do not
            distinguish between types of plug. Therefore, there is no problem
            of <em>Boneh</em> or <em>Soter</em>. <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:24:20
            is not concerned about this and allows one to remove the plug with
            a <em>shinui</em>. In any case, as long as a <em>shinui</em> is
            used, then even concerns of <em>Boneh</em> and <em>Soter</em>
            amount to a doubt about a rabbinic law, and when necessary one may
            be lenient. However, it is still forbidden to plug the appliance
            back in. See <em>Harĥavot</em> for what to do in a case of dire
            necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, most refrigerators have near-constant electrical
            activity, and pulling the plug puts an immediately stop to this
            activity, resulting in an act of <em>Mekhabeh</em>. Nevertheless,
            as long as one pulls the plug with a <em>shinui</em>, since the
prohibition of turning off electricity is rabbinic, it is a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, which is permitted for the sake of a
            mitzva, as explained above in 9:11.

            <strong>Asking a minor: </strong>
            In cases of necessity, when the food is needed to feed a minor, one
            may ask the child to open the refrigerator. Since he has no
            intention of turning the light on, his act of opening the door is
            only prohibited rabbinically, and several Rishonim maintain that
            one may instruct a minor to transgress a rabbinic prohibition for
            his own needs. Some extend this leniency to cases of great need,
            and when necessary one may rely on them, as explained below 24:5

The status of a <em>safek psik reisha</em> is subject to dispute.<em>Taz</em> permits it, while R. Akiva Eger forbids it. The            <em>poskim</em> tend to be lenient in times of necessity,
especially when it is a <em>psik reisha</em>            <em>de-lo niĥa lei</em>, in which case it is a case of doubt about
            a rabbinic law, as explained in BHL 316:3 s.v. "ve-lakhen." SSK
10:15 applies this rule to the case of a refrigerator, as does<em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:24:20. See above, 9:5 and n. 2 and            <em>Harĥavot</em> 9:5:8. If the refrigerator has been opened and
            the light is already on, and one is desperate to close the
            refrigerator door so that the food will not spoil, he should push
            the door in the opposite direction and then let it swing shut on
            its own. This way it is closed via <em>grama</em>. As <em>San</em>.
            77b explains, if one throws a rock upward, and it then falls
straight down, such an action is considered <em>grama</em> )            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 29 n. 38).

            Some are lenient and allow an observant Jew to follow a
            non-observant Jew through an automatic door, maintaining that this
            is not considered benefiting from <em>melakha</em> performed on
            Shabbat, since opening the door is merely removing an obstacle (R.
            Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in SSK 18:63). Furthermore, if the person
            who opens the door is considered an unintentional transgressor, in
            times of necessity one may rely on the opinion of R. Meir that one
            may benefit from <em>melakha</em> performed by such a person on
            Shabbat (MB 318:7). In contrast, there are reasons to be stringent.
First, many maintain that opening such a door is considered a            <em>melakha</em> performed on Shabbat (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ
            2:77). Second, the scenario of an observant Jew waiting for a
            non-observant Jew in order to benefit from his Shabbat desecration
            constitutes a desecration of God’s name. Therefore, one may be
            lenient only under pressing circumstances.

            The claim that one may enter a room where the lights and air
            conditioning will automatically turn on since one is not interested
            in this happening is not legitimate. Part of the reason the system
            was put into place to begin with was to make one’s life easier by
            relieving him of the need to turn on the lights and air
            conditioning every time he enters the room. Just because he does
            not want it to happen on account of a Shabbat prohibition does not
make this a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em>. See            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 26:28, n. 41 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol.

            In addition to causing electrical activity, one who stands in a
place where his image will be captured on the monitor transgresses            <em>Kotev </em>as well (on the rabbinic level, since the image is
            not permanent). See <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 15:35 and 26:27.
            However, when one has no interest in this happening, he may walk

            According to R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and those who follow him in
            stating that using electricity is prohibited rabbinically, ringing
the bell with a <em>shinui</em> renders his action a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, and under pressing circumstances he may be
            lenient. However, for those who maintain that using electricity is
            prohibited by Torah law, even with a <em>shinui</em> it is still
            only a single <em>shvut</em>, which remains forbidden. Since
            according to all opinions, ringing the bell with a <em>shinui</em>
            renders the prohibition rabbinic, there is a rabbinic doubt about
            whether this is a case of <em>shvut di-shvut</em> or not.
            Accordingly, one who wishes may be lenient. As I have written above
            (ch. 9 n. 7), the entire leniency of <em>shvut di-shvut</em> may be
            utilized only rarely, under pressing circumstances.

            If one accidentally presses a doorbell, he should stop pressing as
            soon as he realizes what he has done, because this act of stopping
            is not considered an action. If a light will turn on when he stops
            ringing the bell, some prohibit this (SSK 23:56). Others permit it,
            insisting that letting go of the bell is not considered an action.
            (See <em>Kedushat Ha-Shabbat</em> vol. 2, p. 27.) Under pressing
            circumstances, one may be lenient.

            Within this second possibility, there are two permissible options.
The first is to set it up so that when the system is shut off via            <em>grama</em>, all the sensors stop working, and when it is
            re-armed the sensors resume working. The advantage of this option
            is that while people are home, no sensors are activated. The
            disadvantage is that every turn of the key causes the electrical
            system to turn on or off. The second option is to arrange that the
            sensors are always working, while the key simply serves to connect
            and disconnect the alarm system. The disadvantage of this option is
            that every movement in the house activates the sensors (see the
            previous section). The advantage is that turning the key does not
            cause any recognizable electrical activity. Even when the system is
            armed, if no thief enters, the alarm will not go off.

            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
            23:208 maintains that one may not hire a security service that is
            under Jewish ownership or hires Jewish workers. In contrast, R.
            Shaul Yisraeli (<em>Amud Ha-yemini</em> §17) maintains that police
            may take action against thieves on Shabbat because it prevents
            danger to human life. <em>Be-mar’eh Ha-bazak</em> 4:43 applies this
            approach to monitoring services as well. Nowadays, there is an
            additional reason to be lenient. Thieves in Israel are often
            connected with terrorists. Just as the Sages allowed people in
            border towns to defend themselves on Shabbat against robbers of
            straw and hay (SA 329:6), so, too, people who live anywhere in
            Israel may defend themselves against the thievery of terrorists
            (below 27:12). In practice, one should give preference to a
            monitoring service that tries to hire non-Jewish guards.
            Nevertheless, this is not absolutely necessary, because the primary
            position is that preventing theft involves preserving lives as
            well. Not only that, but one may answer the phone when the
            monitoring service calls to check if there was a break-in. This is
            similar to the case of ambulances, which we discuss in 27:10 below.
            All false alarms cause danger to human life. See <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            Connecting a synagogue ark to an alarm system and disconnecting it
            when the Torah scrolls are taken out to be read must be done by
            means of <em>grama</em>, that is, using a key that activates or
            deactivates the system only a few minutes after the key is turned.
            In <em>Teĥumin </em>1, Rav Dasberg proposed an excellent solution
that does not even require <em>grama</em>. See <em>Harĥavot</em>.            <em> </em><em></em>

            See SSK 28:20, 22 and <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at </em>2:49<em>, </em>which
            state that if one need not press an electric button to see the
            time, one may wear it on Shabbat, and even if it has a calculator
built in, it is not considered a base for a forbidden object (<em>basis le-davar ha-asur</em>; <em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>6:6;            <em>Orĥot Shabbat </em>19:43). Regarding a thermometer and the
            like, the relevant principle is the one described above in section
            14, namely, that causing the activation of sensors that have no
            present purpose is permitted, but is forbidden if they have a
            present purpose. Regarding the adjustment of an alarm clock to an
            earlier or later time, see SSK 28:33; <em>Orĥot Shabbat </em>
            8:90-91.

            Those who are lenient maintain that when there is no need to charge
            the battery, doing so is considered <em>mitasek</em>, as he is
            moving his arm for entirely different purposes, and the clock is
            recharged incidentally and without any purpose. This is even more
lenient than a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em>; in a            <em>psik reisha</em>, one plans to do a particular activity, but in
            the present case, moving one’s arm is not even an intentional
activity. Moreover, there are some who maintain that a            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> is permitted if the activity is
            rabbinically prohibited, and certainly according to those who
            maintain that electricity is a rabbinic prohibition, in which case
            the present example is a rabbinic prohibition on a rabbinic
            prohibition, as explained above (9:2). Moreover, it is possible
            that his movements will not generate electricity because the
internal battery is already full. Thus, wearing it is a<em>davar she-eino mitkaven</em> that does not reach the level of a            <em>psik reisha</em>. See SSK 28:28. However, when the battery
            needs to be full for Shabbat or even Sunday, he wants it to
            recharge, and it is therefore forbidden. According to those who
            maintain that electricity is forbidden by Torah law, one should be
            concerned that this is a violation of Torah law. According to those
            who maintain that electricity is forbidden by rabbinic law or on
            account of <em>Boneh</em>, there are grounds to say that even if
            the watch cannot continue for much longer on its own, one may still
            wear it, as carrying the watch or exposing it to light merely adds
            to the current, which is not forbidden, especially when it is done
            unintentionally. However, if the watch has already stopped, it is
            forbidden for anyone to activate it, as stated with regard to
winding up the spring of a watch in SA 338:15 and MB<em>ad loc</em>. 15 (see also <em>Ĥelkat Yaakov </em>1:75;<em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 6:35:8; <em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>9:20). See            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 26:50.

            R. Levi Yitzĥak Halperin, the head of the Institute for Science and
            Halakha, maintains that in case of need, one may activate devices
            by "impeding an impediment." For example, consider a device that is
            in working order, but a beam of light hitting a particular spot
            prevents the device from working. When one blocks the light beam,
            the device begins to work again. Thus, blocking the beam "impedes
            an impediment" and is considered a <em>grama</em>. According to R.
            Halperin, technically this is even less severe than <em>grama</em>,
            but many disagree with him.

The Zomet Institute has developed three strategies: 1)            <em>Grama</em> by means of a scanner that performs a scan every few
            seconds. When it detects that a switch has been moved, it activates
            the device. 2) Extending a state: every few seconds, the device is
            activated for a second before turning off. If the switch is moved,
            then the device will not turn off after a second, and the "on"
            state is thus extended. 3) The device operates constantly at a
            certain level of power consumption. Flipping the switch merely
increases the electrical current. This relies on the numerous            <em>poskim</em> who maintain that electricity is forbidden on
            account of <em>Molid</em>, and consequently adding to the current
            is not forbidden. Moreover, according to Ĥazon Ish, the prohibition
            of electricity is based on <em>Boneh</em>, and if the electrical
            current already exists, it is not prohibited to add to the current.
            Based on this, they permitted use of a <em>kalno’it</em>. However,
            according to Rav Kook and those who agree with him, as described
            above in section 2, increasing a current is forbidden by Torah law.
            In general, the Zomet Institute relies on the rulings of R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach, R. Yehoshua Neuwirth, and R. Ovadia Yosef, as
            detailed in several essays that have appeared in <em>Teĥumin </em>
            (the journal of contemporary halakhic issues published by the Zomet
            Institute).

            Some say that since these devices were developed for this purpose,
            the leniency of <em>grama</em> does not apply to them at all.
            Rather, operating them has the same status as operating normal
            electrical devices. Moreover, these devices breach the walls that
            safeguard Shabbat. This is the position of <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
21:13; <em>Orĥot Shabbat </em>29:27; <em>Shvut Yitzĥak</em>,<em>Grama</em> 15:15 in the name of R. Elyashiv;            <em>Ĥut Shani </em>vol. 1, p. 206; <em>Binyan Av</em> 4:17. It is
            also implied in <em>Responsa Aĥiezer</em> 3:60. Certainly all of
            the reasons to be stringent apply to the <em>kalno’it</em>:
            according to Rav Kook and those who agree with him (above, section
            2), increasing a current is forbidden by Torah law, and according
            to the remaining <em>poskim</em>, since it moves just as it would
            move during the week, one may not operate it on Shabbat. They also
            forbid the <em>kalno’it</em> because it breaches the walls
            safeguarding Shabbat and belittles its honor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proper approach seems to be the one we learned in 9:9 above.
            That is, a precondition for <em>grama</em> is that the action is
done in a way that differs from the normal way of performing the            <em>melakha</em>. As long as people perceive the device to be
            operating normally, it should not be permitted. Therefore, only if
            the delay is obvious and of significant duration does the device
            operate in a manner that sufficiently differs from the normal mode
            of operation on a weekday. Once the mode of operation is considered
            different, if the activation takes place via <em>grama</em>, that
            is, by means of a scanner, the removal of an impediment, or the
            extension of the present state, will it be permissible in a case of
need, as is the rule in cases of <em>grama</em>. See            <em>Harĥavot</em>.<em> </em>
