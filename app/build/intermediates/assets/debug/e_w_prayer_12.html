    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        During the <em>Amida</em> prayer we stand before God, the King of
        kings. This is not the case regarding other <em>berakhot</em> and
prayers: although all prayers must be recited with solemnity and        <em>kavana</em>, they are not on the same level as the <em>Amida</em>,
        in which we stand before the King. Therefore, the Sages instituted
        special <em>halakhot</em> that pertain solely to the <em>Amida</em>
        prayer.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In order to express one’s desire to come closer to God and to stand
        before Him, we customarily take three steps toward the <em>Amida </em>
        prayer (Rema 95:1). After finishing these steps, one stands in place
and only then recites the verse "        <em>Ado-nai sefatai tiftaĥ u-fi yagid tehilatekha</em>" ("My Lord, open
        my lips and my mouth will speak your praises"; Tehilim 51:7), since
        that verse is part of the <em>Amida</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who goes to synagogue or prays in a designated place in her house
        has already taken more than three steps to get there, and therefore
need not take another three steps prior to praying the <em>Amida</em> (        <em>Eliya Rabba</em>). Some <em>poskim</em> say that it is proper even
        for one who already walked to her place of prayer to take another three
        steps forward, immediately before beginning the <em>Amida</em>, if a
        significant amount of time has elapsed since she arrived at her place
of prayer (<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, <em>Be-shalaĥ</em> 3;        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>95:7). However, because it is not appropriate to
        take three steps back and immediately afterwards three steps forward,
        one who wishes to be meticulous about this should take three steps back
        a short time before the <em>Amida</em>, and, after waiting a bit, take
three steps forward to begin the <em>Amida</em> (        <em>Minhagei Maharil</em>; MB 95:3).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        While reciting all the various <em>berakhot</em> and prayers, it is
        permissible to face in any direction. However, when one stands before
        the King of the world in the <em>Amida</em>, she must turn to face
        Jerusalem, the place that God chose to manifest His Presence in the
        world.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who stands in prayer outside of Eretz Yisrael must face the land
and direct her heart toward Jerusalem, the site of the Temple, and the        <em>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</em> (the Inner Sanctum of the Temple). If is in
        Eretz Yisrael, she must face Jerusalem and direct her heart toward the
        Temple and the <em>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</em>. If she is in Jerusalem, she
faces the site of the Temple and directs her heart toward the        <em>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</em> (<em>Berakhot</em> 30a; SA 94:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Therefore, those reciting the <em>Amida</em> in the women’s section of
        the plaza facing the Kotel must turn diagonally toward the left, toward
        the exact site of the Temple.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In synagogues, it is customary to position the <em>aron kodesh</em>
        (the ark) against the wall that faces Jerusalem, so that those standing
        in prayer also pray towards the direction of the ark. However, the
        primary objective is to pray in the direction of Jerusalem. Therefore,
        if due to error, or because of circumstances beyond control, the ark
        does not exactly face Jerusalem, the people praying should turn to face
        the direction of Jerusalem (MB 94:9). Likewise, someone standing in the
        women’s section must face Jerusalem, even if this is not the direction
        of the ark (MB 94:10).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who does not know the direction of Jerusalem may pray in whichever
        direction she desires while directing her heart towards her Father in
        heaven (SA 94:3). Even if she subsequently discovers that she was
        mistaken, she need not repeat her prayer.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There is a unique law regarding<em> </em>the <em>Amida</em>: it must be
        recited while standing. When one stands, she summons her complete
        being, from head to toe, to prayer. In addition, standing expresses the
        reverence and awe felt toward the King of the world. Therefore, one
        must not lean against anything while reciting the <em>Amida</em>, for
        anyone who is even partially supported is not standing in awe. In
        extenuating circumstances, for instance, if one is weak and must lean
        against something, she should try to lean only slightly, such that if
        the support should be taken from her, she would remain standing on her
        own. In that way, although she is not standing in fear, she is at least
        considered to be praying in a standing position (SA 94:8; MB 22).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must put her legs together so that they look like one leg. The
        reason for this is that the separation of one’s legs exposes one’s
        material side and represents the pursuit of worldly matters. Thus, we
        keep our feet together in prayer just like the <em>kohanim</em> who, in
        their ascent of the altar, would walk heel-to-toe to avoid spreading
        their legs. Furthermore, putting one’s legs together symbolizes the
        annulling of the powers in one’s legs, demonstrating that we have but
        one desire, to stand before Him in prayer. The Sages learn this from
        the angels, of whom it is said: "Their legs are a straight leg"
        (Yeĥezekel 1:7), meaning that their legs were placed so close together
that they appeared as one leg (<em>Berakhot</em> 10b;        <em>y. Berakhot </em>1:1; see Maharal,<em> Netiv Ha-avoda</em> §6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must put the entire length of her foot next to the other so that
        they will seem like one leg to the extent possible, and not merely put
her heels together (SA 95:1; <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>). However,        <em>be-di’avad</em>, if one prayed with her feet apart, she still
        fulfilled her obligation (MB <em>ad loc. </em>1; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>
        2). Someone who has trouble putting her feet together fully should
        place them together to the degree possible.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who is ill and cannot stand may recite the <em>Amida</em> while
        sitting. If she is unable to sit, she may pray while lying down (MB
        94:27; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>34).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even one who must recite the <em>Amida</em> while sitting or lying down
        should try to put her feet together and bow her head at the appropriate
        places. When one sitting in a wheelchair finishes her prayer, she
        should wheel herself slightly backwards, approximately the distance of
        the three steps with which a healthy person would take leave of her
        prayer (based on Rema 94:5).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One reciting the <em>Amida</em> must bow her head slightly, so that her
        eyes point humbly downwards; she must imagine herself standing in the
        Temple and direct her heart toward heaven (<em>Yevamot</em> 105b; SA
        95:2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The kabbalists praise one who prays with her eyes closed. However, even
one who looks into her <em>siddur</em> follows the law<em>le-khatĥila</em>. Many Aĥaronim recommend praying from a        <em>siddur</em>, so that one can have more <em>kavana</em> in her
prayer (MB 95:5; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>9-10; and see BHL, quoting        <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em>).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Regarding one’s hands, Rambam writes (MT, <em>Laws of Prayer</em> 5:4)
        that one should place her hands on her heart while interlocked, right
        over left, so that she stands as a slave before her master, in awe and
fear. This is also the opinion of SA 95:3 and <em>Kavanot Ha-Ari</em> (        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>95:12). Many maintain that the placement of the
        hands depends on local custom; where Rambam lived, it was indeed
        customary to stand before kings and ministers in the manner he
        described. However, people in other areas practiced differently. For
        instance, in Christian lands people customarily stood with their arms
        folded, while in Islamic land they would stand with their hands behind
        their backs, symbolically indicating that they do not even have their
        hands without the consent of the One Who they face in prayer (Mahari
        Aboab, cited by <em>Beit Yosef</em>; MB 95:6). Nowadays, according to
        this, in addition to what Rambam wrote, it is also permissible to stand
        with one’s hands adjacent to her body or holding a <em>siddur</em>, or
        resting on a table<em> </em>next to her <em>siddur</em>, for that, too,
        is considered standing respectfully. However, one should not stand with
        her hands in her pockets or on her hips, for it is inappropriate to
        stand that way in front of respected people.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Many people are accustomed to "shuckling" (swaying) while reciting the        <em>Amida</em>. Rema writes (§48; MB 95:7) that this is the proper way
        to practice <em>le-khatĥila</em>, as it expresses the excitement and
        trepidation of the prayer experience, and in order to involve one’s
        whole body in the service of prayer, as the verse states: "All my bones
will say: ‘God, who is like You?’" (Tehilim 35:10). In contrast,        <em>Shlah</em> states that one should not sway during prayer. On the
        contrary, standing motionless strengthens one’s <em>kavana</em>.
        Furthermore, it says it is not respectful to sway. If one were to come
        before a human king and begin to shake his whole body, the king would
        dismiss him immediately. If so, one should certainly not act that way
        in prayer. <em>Shlah</em> explains that the<em> </em>recommendation to
        sway applies specifically to Torah study or to singing songs and
        praise. However, during the intense and inward-focused <em>Amida</em>,
        in which we stand before the King, it is not proper to move at all;
only one’s lips may move (<em>Shlah</em>,<em> Masekhet Tamid</em>,        <em>Ner Mitzva</em>). Since each custom has opinions on which to rely,
        every person may practice in the manner that allows her to concentrate
        the best (MA, MB 48:5; and see <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>48:7-9).

        <a name="_Toc402175242">5. Bowing During the <em>Amida</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages instituted bowing in five places in the <em>Amida</em>: at
the beginning and end of <em>Avot</em>, at the beginning and end of        <em>Modim</em>, and at the end of the <em>Amida</em>, when one takes
three steps backwards. They specifically chose those two        <em>berakhot</em> because they are the most important, and while
        reciting them one must try harder to concentrate properly (see SA
101:1; MB 3). If one wants to bow at the beginning or end of another        <em>berakha</em>, she is taught not to, so as not to undermine what the
        Sages instituted and so that she does not appear as an arrogant person
        who considers herself more righteous than others. However, one may bow
in the middle of one of the <em>berakhot</em> (SA 113:1; MB 2, see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 17 n. 3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One bows when saying "<em>Barukh Ata</em>" and straightens when saying
"<em>Hashem</em>." For <em>Modim</em>, she bows when saying "<em>Modim anaĥnu lakh</em>" and straightens when saying "        <em>Hashem</em>" (SA 113:7; MB 12; for the laws on bowing down at the
        end of the <em>Amida</em>, see below, section 11).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must bow so low that the vertebrae in one’s spine protrude from her
        back. One bends her head low so that it is below the level of her heart
        and above waist-level, but no lower, as it would appear arrogant. One
        should bow quickly, demonstrating her desire to bow before God, and
        straighten herself slowly, like one who wants to keep bowing before God
        (SA 113:6). An elderly or ill person who has difficulty bending down
        should nod her head as much as she can (SA 113:5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Regarding how one bows, there are two customs. According to the
        Ashkenazic custom, when one says "<em>barukh</em>" she bends her knees
        and when she says "<em>Ata</em>" she bows until her vertebrae protrude.
        At <em>Modim</em>, the word "<em>Barukh</em>" is not recited, so one
bows without first bending her knees (MB 113:12; and see        <em>Kitzur </em>SA 18:1). The Sephardim practice according to Arizal’s
        custom and bow down in two stages. First, one bends her body (without
        bending her knees) and then her head. Similarly, when she straightens
herself, she first straightens her body and then her head (        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>113:21).

        <a name="_Toc402175243">6. Praying Silently</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        We learn many essential <em>halakhot</em> from the prayer of Ĥana, who
        stood and begged God to remember her and grant her a son. Her prayer
        was accepted and she merited giving birth to Shmuel the prophet, who
        was the greatest prophet of Israel behind Moshe. The verse states:
        "Ĥana spoke to her heart, only her lips moved, and her voice was not
        heard" (1 Shmuel 1:13). The Sages teach: "‘Spoke to her heart’ – from
        here [we learn] that the person praying must focus his heart. ‘Only her
        lips moved’ – from here [we learn] that the person praying must
        articulate the words. ‘Her voice was not heard’ – from here [we learn]
that it is prohibited to raise one’s voice while praying" (        <em>Berakhot</em> 31a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The idea behind the <em>Amida</em> prayer is to express the soul’s
        deepest aspirations before God, and therefore it is not proper to
        recite the words aloud and to disclose them outwardly. On the other
        hand, one does not fulfill her obligation with thought alone, since
        every idea must possess some tangible expression in this world. Very
        often, our inner desires are praiseworthy, but their outer expression
        is flawed. Therefore, our task is to express our inner good will
        outwardly, thereby repairing the world. Hence, even the subtlest mitzva
        like prayer, requires some sort of expression – the silent articulation
        of the words with one’s lips.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There are different practices regarding the proper way to pray
        silently. According to most <em>poskim</em> and a few kabbalists, one
        reciting the <em>Amida</em> must utter the words in such a way that
        only she hears her voice but those praying next to her do not (SA
        101:2; MB 5-6). According to most kabbalists, the <em>Amida</em> is so
        intense and internal that one should not even hear her own words; she
        should only mouth the letters with her lips (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>
        101:8). The woman praying may choose the way which enables her to have
        the most <em>kavana</em> in her prayer.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Be-di’avad</em>
        , even if one recites the <em>Amida</em> out loud, she fulfills her
        obligation. Therefore, if one who has difficulty concentrating silently
        is praying alone, in a place where she will not disturb the prayer of
        others, she may pray aloud. However, even in that situation, she should
        not raise her voice, for one who does so behaves like the false
        prophets who think that their gods are hard of hearing and that one
        must yell in order to be heard (<em>Berakhot</em> 24b).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On the Days of Awe, there are parts of the <em>Amida</em> where it is
        customary to raise one’s voice slightly, and one need not be concerned
        that she is disturbing others around her because on those days everyone
        has <em>maĥzorim</em> (SA 101:3). Nevertheless, even in those places,
        one who wishes to enhance the mitzva prays silently.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Regarding the other sections of the prayer service, such as        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> and <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, which are
        not as inward-focused and intense as the <em>Amida</em>, all agree that
the person praying must hear the words she is reciting.        <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if she only mouthed the words without hearing
        them, she fulfilled her obligation, but if she thought the words in her
        mind, without even mouthing them, she did not fulfill her obligation.

        <a name="_Toc402175244">7. In Any Language</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One may recite the <em>Amida</em> in any language (<em>Sota</em> 32a).
        However, it is best to pray in Hebrew, for that is the language in
        which the Men of the Great Assembly composed the prayers. Furthermore,
        Hebrew is the holy tongue and is the language with which the world was
        created.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        An additional advantage to praying in Hebrew, untrue of any other
        language, is that one may pray in Hebrew even if she does not
understand it. As long as she understands the first verse of        <em>Shema</em> and the first <em>berakha</em> of the <em>Amida</em>,
        she fulfills her obligation. In any other language, only one who
        understands what she is saying fulfills her obligation (MB 101:14 and
        124:2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In practice, one who does not understand Hebrew may choose the language
        in which to pray. On one hand, there is an advantage to praying in a
language that she understands, for it enables her to have more        <em>kavana</em>. On the other hand, if she prays in Hebrew, she prays
        in the holy tongue (see BHL 101:4; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>16).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Permission to pray in other languages is granted only as a temporary
        measure (<em>hora’at sha’ah</em>), specifically for people who do not
understand Hebrew. However, it is prohibited to organize a        <em>minyan</em> of people who pray regularly in a different language.
        That was one of the sins of the Reform movement, which translated the
        prayers to German and caused their children to forget the holy tongue,
leading the way to assimilation and the abandonment of Judaism (        <em>Ĥatam Sofer</em>,<em> </em>OĤ<em> </em>84 and 86; MB 101:13).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One reciting the <em>Amida</em> must have <em>kavana</em>, that is, she
        must pay attention to what she is saying and must try not to let her
        mind be distracted by anything else during the prayer. If other
        thoughts enter her mind, she must expel them and return to her prayer.
        Even if she does not succeed in concentrating on all of the words, she
must at least try to have <em>kavana</em> for the conclusion of each<em>berakha</em>. If she cannot concentrate during all of the<em>berakhot</em>, she must make an effort to concentrate on        <em>Avot</em> and <em>Modim</em>, for those are the <em>berakhot</em>
        in which we bow down at their beginning and at their end. At the very
        least, she must have <em>kavana</em> in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em>,
        the first <em>berakha</em> of the <em>Amida</em> (SA 101:1 and MB 1-3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one recited the <em>Amida</em> but did not have <em>kavana</em>
during <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em>, technically she must repeat the        <em>Amida</em>, because <em>kavana</em> during that <em>berakha</em> is
        requisite for fulfilling her obligation. However, due to the decline of
        generations and other preoccupations, our ability to concentrate has
weakened. Therefore, the Aĥaronim rule that we do not repeat the<em>Amida</em>, since there is concern that even in reciting the        <em>Amida</em> a second time, she will forget to have <em>kavana</em>
        during <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em>, and her repetition will be for
        naught (Rema 101:1; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>4). Hence, one who knows that
she will not be able to have <em>kavana</em> even for<em>Birkat Avot </em>should preferably not even begin the<em>Amida</em>. She should instead fulfill her obligation by reciting        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.

        If one is about to finish <em>Avot</em> and notices that she did not
        have <em>kavana</em> in its recitation, as long as she has not yet said
        God’s name at the conclusion of the <em>berakha</em>, she goes back to
        "<em>Elokei Avraham</em>" and continues from there with <em>kavana</em>
        (MB 101:4, in the name of <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>). If she has already said
        God’s name, she concludes the <em>berakha</em> with <em>kavana</em>. It
is preferable that she go back and think the words of <em>Birkat</em>        <em>Avot</em> in her heart, for, in Rambam’s opinion, thought is
        considered speech (<em>hirhur ke-dibur</em>). However, if she already
        began the second <em>beraka </em>with the words "<em>Ata gibor</em>,"
        she continues to pray and must try to have <em>kavana</em> while
reciting the remaining <em>berakhot</em>, especially <em>Birkat</em><em>Modim</em>, for some <em>poskim</em> maintain that having        <em>kavana</em> in <em>Modim</em> rectifies the lack of <em>kavana</em>
        in <em>Avot</em>.

            9. The Order of the <em>Berakhot</em> of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
        </a>
        <em></em>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
        , the weekday <em>Amida</em>, is divided into three parts: praise,
petition, and thanksgiving. While reciting the first three        <em>berakhot</em>, we resemble slaves who offer words of praise before
        their master. While reciting the middle blessings we are like slaves
        who make requests of their master. When we recite the last three
        blessings, we are like slaves who gracefully accept reward from their
        master, then are dismissed and go on their way (<em>Berakhot</em> 34a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        We learn this from the prayer of Moshe, which begins with praise before
        continuing to plead and petition (<em>Berakhot</em> 32a; also see
        below, 15:3). Without the introductory praise, there is concern that
        our prayer will resemble pagan worship, whose entire aim is to
        magically manipulate higher powers to work for one’s benefit. In
        contrast, we wish to serve God and devote ourselves to Him, and all we
        ask is that He bestows goodness and blessing upon us in abundance so
        that we can study Torah, perform <em>mitzvot</em>, and<em> </em>reveal
        His name in the world. Therefore, we must first recognize before Whom
        we stand in prayer. We stand before God, the great, the mighty, and the
        awesome, the One Who sustains life and resurrects the dead, the holy
        God. With that understanding, we can approach Him and pray with a pure
        heart for all of Israel and for ourselves (see <em>Olat Re’iyah </em>
        vol. 1, p. 14).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The petitionary section, in which there are thirteen <em>berakhot</em>,
        contains and expresses the general aspirations of the Jewish people.
        They do not focus on the individual advancement of the person praying,
        but on the revelation of God’s glory in the world. Even our personal
requests for health and livelihood are to enable us to participate in        <em>tikun olam</em>. We ask for the following thirteen things: wisdom,
        repentance, forgiveness, redemption, health, livelihood, the
ingathering of the Jews from exile<em> </em>(<em>Kibbutz</em>        <em>Galuyot</em>), the restoration of justice, the destruction of those
        who hate us, the blessing for the righteous, the rebuilding of
        Jerusalem, the re-establishment of the Davidic dynasty, and finally,
        that our prayers be heard.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
After these requests, we end the <em>Amida</em> with three general        <em>berakhot</em>, the centerpiece of which is <em>Modim</em>, a
        blessing of thanks for our our lives and for all the goodness that God
constantly bestows upon us. It is accompanied by two other        <em>berakhot</em>. In the first we pray for the restoration of the
        Temple service, and in the last we pray for peace, since peace is the
        vessel that contains all <em>berakhot</em>. It is important to note
that the Men of the Great Assembly were precise about the order of the        <em>berakhot</em>, and one who switches their order does not fulfill
        her obligation (see below, 13:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In truth, <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> (which means "eighteen") is comprised
        of nineteen <em>berakhot</em>. When the Men of the Great Assembly first
instituted the <em>Amida</em>, it was made up of eighteen        <em>berakhot</em>. After the proliferation of slanderers and informers
        after the rise of Christianity and its preaching of hatred against the
        Jews, the Sages instituted an additional <em>berakha</em>, a prayer to
        save the nation from apostates and slanderers.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Men of the Great Assembly, in their wisdom and divine inspiration,
        incorporated all the ideal aspirations of the Jewish people in their
        formulation of the <em>Amida</em>. They meticulously chose every word
        until arriving at the perfect wording, with which the Jewish soul can
        pour itself out before the Creator in the most exalted manner possible
        (above, 1:6).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Even so, if one wishes to add personal requests in the middle<em>berakhot</em>, she may. However, in the first three        <em>berakhot</em>, which are intended to praise God, and in the last
        three, which are intended for thanksgiving, one may not add personal
        requests, so as not to detract from their general purpose (SA 112:1;
        119:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The personal requests permitted in the middle <em>berakhot</em> must be
        related to the theme of the <em>berakha</em>. For example, one may pray
for the sick in <em>Refa’enu</em>, for livelihood in        <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>, or for relatives to make <em>aliya</em> in
        the <em>Kibbutz Galuyot</em>. In this respect, <em>Shomei’a Tefila</em>
        is unique in that one may make all types of requests in it. Since it is
        the culmination of the petitionary <em>berakhot</em>, it encompasses
        them all. When one adds personal requests, she begins by reciting the
fixed formulation and adds her request just before the last line of the        <em>berakha</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Personal requests are not only permissible but even encouraged,
        according to many, since the personal prayers come from the depths of
        the heart and inspire <em>kavana</em>. Nevertheless, it is preferable
that one not prolong her personal prayers excessively, not even in        <em>Shome’a Tefila</em>, because the <em>Amida </em>is primarily
        focused on collective needs, and when one adds numerous personal
        requests, it negates the universal character of the <em>Amida</em>. It
        is better that one who wishes to add more personal prayers does so
        after finishing all the <em>berakhot</em> and saying (the first
        instance of) "<em>Yihyu le-ratzon…</em>" since everything recited after
        that is not fully part of the <em>Amida.</em> Nevertheless, since she
        has not yet taken three steps backwards, she is still standing before
        the Almighty in prayer, and her personal requests are joined together
        with the main part of the <em>Amida</em> (SA<em> </em>119:2; MB
        119:12).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must express her requests in the <em>Amida</em> properly.
        Therefore, when praying for the sick, the patient’s name should be
        mentioned. <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, it is good to mention the patient’s
        name along with his mother or father’s name. However, in the presence
        of the patient, it is unnecessary to mention his name, for her
        intention is clear (MB 119:2).

            11. The Conclusion of the <em>Amida</em> and Three Steps Back
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In reciting the verse, "<em>Yihyu le-ratzon</em>…" ("May the
        expressions of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart find favor before
        You, God, my Rock, and my Redeemer"; Tehilim 19:15) right after
completing the <em>berakha </em>for peace, we end the main part of the        <em>Amida</em>. At this point, <em>Elokai Netzor</em>, a paragraph of
        personal pray, is customarily added. As we have learned, this is where
        one may add as much personal petition and supplication as she wants. It
        is said that R. Akiva would prolong his prayers extensively with
        supplications when praying alone (see <em>Berakhot</em> 31a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Upon the conclusion of the prayers of supplication, one recites        <em>Yihyu le-ratzon</em> again and takes three steps backward, thereby
        departing the King’s presence. The Sages say that if one prays and does
        not depart from the <em>Amida</em> properly by taking three steps back
        and saying "<em>Oseh shalom…</em>," it would have been better not to
        have prayed at all (<em>Yoma</em> 53b). One who does not take leave
        properly demonstrates that she does not understand that she was
        standing before the Almighty King, and she thus demeans prayer.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        After finishing the <em>Amida</em>, before beginning the three steps,
        one bows as she does during <em>Modim</em> (as explained in section 5
        above), and while bowing she takes three steps backward. Still bowing,
        she then turns to her left and says, "<em>Oseh shalom bi-mromav</em>"
        ("May He Who makes peace in His high places…"), then to her right side
        and says, "<em>Hu ya’aseh shalom aleinu</em>" (make peace for us …"),
and finally bows forward and says, "<em>ve-al kol Yisrael</em>,        <em> ve-imru Amen</em>" ("and all of Israel; and say: ‘amen’"). She
then straightens up slowly. Many people then recite the "        <em>Yehi ratzon</em>" paragraph praying for the restoration of the
        Temple, since prayer corresponds to the <em>Tamid</em> sacrifice and we
ask that the Temple be rebuilt so that we may bring this offering (SA,        <em> </em>Rema 123:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When stepping back, one takes the first step with the left leg – the
        weaker leg – thereby demonstrating her reluctance to take leave of her
        prayer. Each step should be the length of her foot, that is, she steps
        back toe-to-heel. The order of the steps is as follows: she first takes
        a small step with her left foot, so that the toes of her left foot abut
        her right heel. Then she takes a bigger step with her right foot, so
        that the toes of her right foot abut her left heel. Finally, she takes
        a small step with her left foot, so that her feet are even with each
        other. Her feet remain together while she recites <em>Oseh shalom.</em>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must be careful not to take a step shorter than the length of her
        foot (heel-to-toe), for some <em>poskim</em> maintain that less than
        that is not considered a step (MA). When there is not enough room
        behind her to take three steps, she steps to the side, making sure that
        each step is long enough (AHS 123:5). In extenuating circumstances,
        when there is no room to step backwards or sideways, she may rely on
        the opinions that three smaller steps are sufficient. However, one may
        not take less than the three steps with which one takes leave from the
        King’s presence (<em>Baĥ</em>, and see MB 123:14); nor may one take
more than three steps, so as not to display arrogance (SA 123:4;        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 17 n. 9). Likewise, it is not
        proper to take large steps, so as not to appear as though she wants to
        distance herself from the King (Rema 123:3; and see MB<em> </em>16).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        After taking three steps backwards, one must remain standing in that
place. She may not immediately return to where she prayed the        <em>Amida</em>, for if she does, she resembles a dog that returns to
        its vomit (<em>Yoma</em> 53b), since if she returns to stand before the
        King without any good reason, having just taken leave from Him, she
        shows that she did not understand that she was standing before the King
        and departed His presence. Her behavior is thus considered disgraceful.
        Some people compound this error by returning to their initial stance
and then lifting their heels slightly, as one does when reciting        <em>Kedusha</em>. There is no reason at all to do so.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The proper practice is as follows: If one wishes to return to the place
        where she stood in prayer, she should wait in place for about half a
        minute to a minute and then do so. When necessary for her to return to
        the original place immediately, such as when she is blocking passage,
        she should wait a few seconds – the amount of time it takes to walk
        four <em>amot</em> – and then return (MB 123:11; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>
        20). If she does not wish to return to her original place, she may go
        on her way immediately after reciting "<em>Yehi ratzon</em>."
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman who is praying in a <em>minyan</em> must wait in place after
        taking three steps back until the <em>ĥazan</em> begins his repetition
        of the <em>Amida</em> (SA 123:2). According to most <em>poskim</em>,
        there is no need to remain standing with one’s feet together after
reciting "<em>Oseh shalom</em>" (MB 123:6, BHL, and SHT        <em>ad loc.</em>). However, there are those who recommend remaining
with one’s legs together until she returns to her place (        <em>Kitzur </em>SA 18:13).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one who regularly prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> or <em>Minĥa</em> is
driving a car when the time to pray arrives, she may not recite the        <em>Amida </em>because she will not have proper <em>kavana </em>and may
        even endanger lives. Rather, she should pull over and only then pray.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        However, if she is a passenger, and she or the driver is in a hurry to
        get to the destination, she may recite the <em>Amida</em> while
        sitting, since if they stop so that she can pray standing, she will be
preoccupied with finishing her prayers quickly and will not have proper<em>kavana</em>. Therefore, it is better that she pray        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> while sitting, since, as we have seen (section
        3 above), one who recites the <em>Amida</em> while sitting fulfills her
        obligation <em>be-di’avad</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even one who is sitting while reciting the <em>Amida</em> must put her
        feet together (MB 95:2) and try to face Jerusalem (MB 94:15). At the
        times she is supposed to bow, she should straighten herself slightly
        and bow as much as she can (SA 94:5; AHS 18).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When traveling by bus or train, both of which are more spacious than a
        car, if one can stand and concentrate properly, it is better that she
        stand for <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. However, if standing will disturb
        her <em>kavana</em>, whether because of the vehicle’s motion or because
        of the embarrassment in front of the other passengers, she may sit with
        her feet together and pray. If she is able to stand for a brief time to
        bow down, she should stand up, bow in the appropriate places, and then
        sit again. If possible, at the end of her prayer, she should stand and
        takes three steps backwards.

            14. May One Pray while Sitting on a Regular Basis?
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        As we have learned, the Sages established that <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
        is prayed while standing; one may only pray seated on a temporary
        basis, in times of need. Therefore, even if it is difficult for a man
        who travels to work every day to find time to pray while standing, he
        may not be lenient and regularly pray sitting. Only when he is in
        circumstances beyond his control is he permitted to pray on a regular
        basis while sitting.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Are women also permitted to pray while sitting on a regular basis while
        they are in circumstances beyond their control? There are women who
        almost never have an opportunity to pray standing. Immediately upon
        rising in the morning they must take care of their children, bathe
        them, dress them, feed them, and send them off to nursery and to
        school. Then they must go to work to help support the family
        financially. They may not pray at work, because they cannot take from
        their boss’s time. The only time she can pray <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
        is while traveling to work, in a sitting position. What should she do?
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        On one hand, since there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that a woman
        may fulfill her obligation of prayer by reciting a brief prayer, it is
        best that she fulfills her obligation with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and refrain from regularly praying        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> in a sitting position. On the other hand, since
she has no other option, she is therefore permitted to pray        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> on a regular basis while sitting. Additionally,
this scenario is not considered a completely regular basis since on        <em>Shabbatot</em>, festivals, and vacation days she must pray while
        standing.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In practice, since there are opinions both ways, every woman may choose
how she wants to practice. If she wishes to pray        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> consistently every day, she can pray on her way
        to work while sitting. If she wants to fulfill her obligation by
        reciting a short prayer, she may. One who is uncertain what to do
        regarding her specific situation should ask a rabbi. On certain trains
        and buses that have comfortable places to stand, she should pray while
        standing <em>le-khatĥila</em> (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 17
        n. 14).

Indeed, according to Rif, only one who is reciting the            <em>Amida </em>with a <em>minyan</em> may pray in another language.
The reason for this is that the divine Presence dwells within a            <em>minyan</em>; therefore her prayer will be accepted even if it
            is not in the holy tongue. However, the prayer of one who prays
alone in a different language is not accepted. Nevertheless, most            <em>poskim</em> agree with Rosh, who maintains that even one
            praying alone may pray in another language, as long as it is not
            Aramaic. This is the halakhic ruling (SA 101:4, based on the rule
            that the <em>halakha</em> follows the last "<em>yesh omrim</em>,"

            more so women, who <em>be-di’avad</em> are allowed to fulfill their
            obligation by reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, as explained
            above, 2:4-5. See also <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 17 n.
            6. The Aĥaronim explain that <em>be-di’avad</em>, even if one did
            not have <em>kavana</em> at all while reciting the <em>Amida</em>,
            since he did intend to fulfill the mitzva of prayer, he fulfills
            his obligation. So states <em>Shibolei Ha-leket</em> §17 in the
            name of the Rishonim. Similarly, <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>101:4 states
in the name of <em>Ĥesed La-Avraham</em> that the<em>berakhot </em>of one who prays without <em>kavana</em> are not            <em>berakhot le-vatala</em>. This means that what he recited is
            considered prayer; however, because he lacked <em>kavana</em>, the
Sages maintain that it is necessary for him to repeat the            <em>Amida</em>. The proof for this is that one who realizes in the
            middle of the <em>Amida</em> that he did not have <em>kavana</em>
            for the first <em>berakha</em> does not immediately go back, which
            means that there is value to what he prayed without <em>kavana</em>
            . This is not true of one who realizes that he mistakenly mentioned
            rain in the summer, for in that case he is required to go back
            immediately.<strong> </strong>

            A woman who almost always has <em>kavana</em> but this time did
            not, and who is certain that when she repeats her prayer she will
            have <em>kavana</em> from the beginning of the <em>Amida</em> until
            the end, may repeat her prayer with the utmost <em>kavana</em>. It
            is best that she makes a stipulation that if the prevailing custom
            exempts her from repeating her prayer, it should be considered a
            voluntary prayer (<em>tefilat nedava</em>).

            The <em>Amida</em> continued to be called "<em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
            ," since this was its name originally. My teacher and master, R.
Zvi Yehuda Kook, further explains that the essence of the            <em>Amida</em> is, indeed, the eighteen <em>berakhot</em> that have
inherent value as praise and petition. Only            <em>Birkat Ha-minim</em> is about the uprooting of evil and
            therefore temporary, since the eradication of evil will render it
unnecessary. Therefore the name of the <em>Amida</em> remains "            <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>" (quoted in <em>Netiv Bina</em>,<em> </em>
            vol. 1, p. 261)<em>.</em>

            See SA 94:5. If one has two options, to stand with her feet apart
            or to sit with her feet together, it is preferable to stand.
            Similarly, it seems that it is preferable to pray while standing,
            even if not toward Jerusalem, than to pray while sitting facing
            Jerusalem (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 17 n. 12).

            The opinions concerning the obligation of women are explained
            above, 2:1-5. I have spoken to many rabbis regarding this matter.
            R. Dov Lior says that it is best to rely on the opinion of MA and
that a woman should fulfill her obligation by praying            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah,</em> whereas
            R. Naĥum Rabinovitch says that it is preferable to pray the full
            prayer while sitting.
