    </p>
    <p>
In addition to <em>Kotev </em>(writing), <em>Moĥek</em> (erasing), and<em>Tzove’a </em>(dyeing), this chapter will also explain the        <em>melakhot </em>of <em>Mafshit</em> (skinning), <em>Me’abed</em>
        (tanning), <em>Memaĥek</em> (smoothing), and <em>Mesartet</em>
        (marking).

        1. <em>Kotev</em> and <em>Moĥek</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Kotev</em>
        is the <em>melakha</em><em> </em>of expressing ideas precisely using
        letters, numbers, or meaningful pictures in a manner that allows the
        idea to last a long time. In the <em>Mishkan</em>, letters were written
        on the posts that formed its walls so that the order, position, and
        orientation of each post would always be clear. Sometimes mistakes
        would be made, so there was a need to erase the letters and replace
them with the correct ones. This is the <em>melakha</em> of<em>Moĥek</em>, erasing in order to write other letters (        <em>Shabbat</em> 103a; Rashi on <em>Shabbat</em> 73a).
    </p>
    <p>
At first glance, <em>Kotev</em> seems to be a trivial and insubstantial        <em>melakha </em>that should not have been included on the list of
        serious <em>melakhot</em> prohibited on Shabbat. However, in truth,
        writing is the basis for human activity. No matter how smart one was or
        how good a memory one had, he would still have had difficulty
remembering exactly where to place each individual post in the        <em>Mishkan</em>. This is the case with all complex matters: if one
        does not write them down, he will not remember them precisely and he
        will lose the ability to reconstruct the knowledge he has accumulated
        and the achievements he has already attained. Through writing, mankind
        was able to develop scientifically and improve human life.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to ensure that information is precise, sometimes it is
        necessary to erase a mistake in order to replace it with accurate
        information. Even if a piece of paper has a stain on it and one erases
        it so he can write letters instead, he transgresses <em>Moĥek</em>, as
        his erasure prepares the writing surface (SA 340:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes erasing is considered a <em>melakha</em> even if one does not
        plan to write in the place of the erasure; for example, if there is an
        extra letter in a Torah scroll which must be erased in order to render
        the Torah kosher (<em>Shabbat</em> 104b; BHL 340:3, s.v. "ha-moĥek").
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a rubber stamp is also considered <em>Kotev</em>. It makes no
        difference whether the stamp is held with the right or left hand,
        because the stamp can be easily used with either hand. Similarly, using
        a printer, photocopier, or fax machine is prohibited by Torah law on
        Shabbat, since doing so commits meaningful symbols or letters to
        writing (see MA, OĤ 32:57; <em>Taz</em>, YD 271:8; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>
        , OĤ 4:40:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not type letters or characters on a computer or save them to a
        computer’s memory. It is also forbidden to take photographs, or to
        record voices or sounds. However, since these actions do not produce
        stable forms or letters, many maintain that the prohibition is
        rabbinic.

        2. Defining the Prohibition of Writing and Exploring Leniencies for
        Life-Threatening Situations
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is critically important to define each <em>melakha</em> precisely
        and establish what is rabbinically prohibited and what is prohibited by
        Torah law, and moreover these determinations have practical
        consequences. For example, when writing is necessary in a hospital or
        in the army in order to save lives, <em>le-khatĥila</em> one should
        minimize the prohibitions one violates and write in a manner that is
        only rabbinically prohibited. We shall first clarify what is prohibited
        by Torah law and what is rabbinically prohibited, and then detail how
        one should write in cases where there is danger to human life.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition of <em>Kotev </em>refers to writing normally with
        the right hand, though one who writes irregularly with the left hand
        violates a rabbinic prohibition. A lefty who writes with his left hand
        violates Torah law, and if he uses his right hand he violates rabbinic
        law. One who is ambidextrous violates Torah law by writing with either
        hand (<em>Shabbat</em> 103a).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one holds the pen with a <em>shinui </em>- in his mouth, with his
        foot, or with the back of his hand - he violates a rabbinic prohibition
        (MT 11:14).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition of <em>Kotev </em>also refers to writing that
        lasts for a significant amount of time. Therefore, if one writes with a
        pencil or pen on paper, he violates Torah law. However, if he writes
        using fruit juice, which will quickly fade, or with a regular pen but
        on a leaf that will dry out and crumble, he violates a rabbinic
        prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the vast majority of <em>poskim</em>, the Torah
        prohibition of <em>Kotev</em> applies to all languages (MT 11:10; BHL
        306:11). A few <em>poskim</em> maintain that the Torah prohibition
        applies only to letters that may appear in a Torah scroll, but writing
        in any other script, in a foreign language, or in cursive Hebrew,
        constitutes a rabbinic transgression (<em>Or Zaru’a</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        If writing is necessary to save lives, and it is clear that a slight
        delay will not cause any further danger, the prohibition should be
        minimized by writing with a <em>shinui</em>, using the left hand. If
        one is ambidextrous, he should grasp the writing utensil with the back
        of his hand or between his little finger and ring finger. Ideally, a
        medical professional should buy a "Shabbat pen" whose ink disappears
        within a few days and with which writing is only rabbinically
        forbidden. If something must be typed on a computer, a <em>shinui</em>
        should be used if possible, such as typing with the knuckles, with a
        teaspoon, or the like. It is also preferable to write in cursive rather
        than in block letters.
    </p>
    <p>
        To summarize, if one must write because of a life-threatening
        situation, it is preferable to use a Shabbat pen, since everyone agrees
        this is only rabbinically prohibited. Even with a Shabbat pen, it is
        proper to write using a <em>shinui</em> if possible. When a Shabbat pen
        is not available, one may write or type as needed, but in cursive and
        using a <em>shinui</em> when possible.
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Incidental Writing and Erasing
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not cut through letters that are written on a cake in frosting,
        candy, or the like. Similarly, if a cake is decorated with a meaningful
        picture, like a tree or a house, one may not cut through the picture.
        Even though one’s intention in cutting the cake is to eat it, since the
        letters or pictures have meaning and it is very clear that they are
being "erased" when the cake is cut, it is rabbinically prohibited (        <em>Mordechai</em>; Rema 340:3). However, one may cut between the
        letters. Even though this separates a word into its component parts,
        one does not violate <em>Moĥek</em> as long as each letter remains
        whole. Therefore, if a cake that one plans to serve on Shabbat is being
        decorated, it should be done in such a way that one will be able to cut
        between the letters and pictures. Afterward, the slices of cake may be
        eaten even though eating them will destroy the letters. Since one is
        engaged in the process of eating, it is not considered <em>Moĥek</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When letters or pictures appear on cookies as a result of having been
        stamped into the cookie dough, as with petits beurres cookies, there is
        no prohibition against cutting or breaking them. Since these letters
        have no significance, erasing them incidentally is not prohibited (MB
        340:15).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some maintain that it is rabbinically prohibited to read a book that
        has letters stamped or written on the edges of the pages (such as a
        library stamp) because when one opens the book the letters break apart,
        and when it is closed they are reconstructed (<em>Levush</em>; MA). In
        practice, if no other book is available, one may read such a book,
        because many maintain that bringing the different parts of a letter
        together is not considered <em>Kotev</em>, nor is separating them
        considered <em>Moĥek</em>. Additionally, since a book is meant to be
opened and closed repeatedly, this is not considered even short-term        <em>Kotev</em> and <em>Moĥek</em>, and thus involves no prohibition
        (Rema 340:3; <em>Taz</em>; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 17).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some rule that if opening a package of food will definitely tear
        letters or pictures, it may not be opened on Shabbat. They permit
        opening the package only if it is possible that the letters or pictures
        will not be torn in the process (based on <em>Taz</em>). Others
        maintain that one may open such a package, since all parts of the
        letters actually remain, but have simply been separated from each other
        (based on Rema). <em>Le-khatĥila</em> it is proper to be stringent, but
        when there is no way to open a package without tearing letters, one may
        be lenient. One who opens the package has no interest in "erasing" the
        letters, and the action is not constructive but destructive.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may wear shoes whose soles are stamped with letters or pictures,
        even though walking in these shoes may leave impressions of these
        letters or pictures on mud or similar surfaces.

    </p>
    <p>
        One who wrote on himself with a pen may still wash his hands and dry
        them in the usual way, since ink generally does not come off as a
        result of washing and drying one’s hands one time. However, if he would
        like the letters to come off, he must be careful to wash and dry his
        hands gently, so that he does not assist in the removal of the letters.
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Temporary Writing, Word Games, and Jigsaw Puzzles
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, temporary writing is rabbinically prohibited. Erasing
        something when one does not plan to write something else in its place
        is rabbinically prohibited as well. Therefore, one may not write in the
        condensation on a window or erase such writing. Similarly, one may not
        form letters in the sand or erase them (MB 340:20-21).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not mark a page using his fingernail to remind oneself that the
        page contains something notable or something that needs to be
        corrected. Since he is creating a lasting mark, it is rabbinically
        prohibited (MB 340:25; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 51).
        However, one may dog-ear the page, because there his goal is not to
        "engrave" a mark in the paper. Rather, the fold itself is the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some allow a sick person to use a thermometer strip. They maintain that
        it is not really writing since the numbers are already imprinted on the
        strip, and the temperature only makes them visible for a short time,
        after which they disappear (<em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:29). Others forbid
        this, considering it temporary writing (SSK 40:2). Since the issue is
        rabbinic, one may be lenient in times of need (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
        14:30; below 28:11). Similarly, <em>le-khatĥila</em> one should not
        perform any medical tests that cause colors to appear, but in times of
        need, one may be lenient (<em>ibid.</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Colorful blocks may be put next to each other to form a letter, and
        thread may be laid down in the shape of a letter. This is because the
        blocks or thread already exist; one is simply arranging them.
        Similarly, he may juxtapose two cards that together form a picture,
        letter, or word. This is because all the forms already exist; they are
        simply being brought together.
    </p>
    <p>
        This applies when the different parts do not connect to each other or
to a board. However, if they do connect, most contemporary        <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is rabbinically forbidden to put them
        together and that therefore one may not pin parts of letters to a board
        to form a whole letter, on account of <em>Kotev</em>. Similarly, one
        may not assemble a jigsaw puzzle, since creating meaningful pictures
        also constitutes <em>Kotev</em>. Others permit these activities,
        maintaining that they are not considered writing since all the writing
        already exists, and the activity merely brings the letters or puzzle
        pieces into proximity. However, even according to the lenient position,
        one may not complete a jigsaw puzzle in order to preserve it as a
        portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, those who wish may be lenient and allow their children to
        engage in these activities, but it is proper for adults to be
        stringent, as most <em>poskim</em> are stringent here. More generally,
        it is important to realize that Shabbat is meant to be dedicated to
        Torah, and some therefore say that adults may not play games on Shabbat
        at all (below 22:13, 24:7; and <em>Harĥavot</em>).
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use a multiple-dial combination lock on Shabbat, because
        turning the discs to align the numbers is not considered writing. The
        numbers are already there; one is merely realigning them temporarily to
        form the correct combination and open the lock (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
        13:44).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Dyeing
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Tzove’a</em>
        is a <em>melakha </em>with the objective of making something more
        beautiful. In the <em>Mishkan</em>, the woolen threads of the curtains
were dyed indigo, royal purple, and scarlet. Even though the        <em>melakha</em> of <em>Kotev</em> can be described as "dyeing" a page
with letters, there is a difference between <em>Kotev</em> and        <em>Tzove’a</em>. The goal of writing is to express an idea. Even when
        the "writing" is a picture of a house or a tree, the goal is still to
        express an idea, and that is how one transgresses <em>Kotev</em>. In
        contrast, the goal of dyeing is not to express an idea, but to beautify
        an item. Therefore, one who creates a meaningful image on paper or on a
        wall transgresses <em>Kotev</em>, and if he then colors it to beautify
        it he transgresses <em>Tzove’a</em> (<em>y. Shabbat</em> 7:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, it is prohibited by Torah law to paint, color, or dye walls,
        cabinets, utensils, fabric, or clothing on Shabbat. The specific color
        is irrelevant; any color that beautifies is prohibited by Torah law.
        Even if the paint is colorless and merely adds glaze or shine, it is
        prohibited, because shine is considered color. It is prohibited by
        Torah law to paint a wall even if it was previously painted with the
        same or a different color.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also prohibited by Torah law to polish shoes. Even if the polish
        is neutral or colorless, it is prohibited by Torah law, because it
        makes the shoes shine. If the polish is a cream that is spread on the
        shoes, then one who applies it also transgresses <em>Memare’aĥ</em>
        (section 6 below). If the polish improves the leather, then one
        transgresses <em>Me’abed</em> as well (MB 327:12, 16; see section 6
        below). Even if the polish was applied before Shabbat, one may not buff
        the shoes on Shabbat to make them shine, because shine is considered
        color. However, if there is dust on the shoes, one may gently remove it
        with a rag (SSK 15:40).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition of <em>Tzove’a </em>is limited to permanent dyes.
        If the color will come off by itself within a short time, the
        prohibition is rabbinic (MT 9:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one’s hands become stained with fruit, blood, or any other
        substance, <em>le-khatĥila</em> he should first wash his hands and only
        afterward dry them with a towel, to avoid "dyeing" the towel.
        Similarly, if juice spills on a tablecloth, the one who wipes it off
        should be careful not to drag the juice along the cloth as that will
        dye the tablecloth. Even though such "dyeing" dirties the tablecloth
        rather than beautifying it, those who are stringent maintain that since
        it is normal to dye such a cloth, it is rabbinically prohibited (SA
320:20). In times of need one may be lenient, since many        <em>poskim</em> say that adding color in a way that dirties the object
        is not prohibited (MB 320:59; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> <em>ad loc.</em>
        122).
    </p>
    <p>
        Since bandages or tissues are not normally dyed, they may be used to
        clean up blood or other colored substances. Since the color added
        dirties material that is not normally dyed, there is no prohibition
        (SAH §302, <em>Kuntres Aĥaron</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone agrees that there is no issue of staining the hands or mouth
        when eating strawberries or other brightly colored foods, because this
        is not the normal way to color skin, and any such coloring is actually
        dirtying the skin (MB 320:58). However, one may not put on makeup, as
        we explained earlier (14:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a toilet has an automatic toilet bowl cleaner that colors the water
        with every flush, <em>poskim</em> disagree whether one may flush the
        toilet on Shabbat. Some maintain that since people are interested in
        the water being colored, it is rabbinically prohibited even though the
        color is present only briefly. Others maintain that since the primary
        goal is to clean the toilet, and the color is just incidental, one may
        flush the toilet. In practice, it is preferable to use a clear toilet
        bowl cleaner. However, if one finds himself in a place where the
        cleaning material is colored, he may flush the toilet. Those who wish
        to be lenient and use a colored toilet bowl cleaner have an opinion to
        rely upon.

6. <em>Mafshit</em>,<em> Me’abed</em>,<em> Memaĥek</em>,<em> </em>and        <em>Mesartet</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are four <em>melakhot</em> that relate to preparing animal skins
for writing: <em>Mafshit</em>, <em>Me’abed</em>, <em>Memaĥek</em>, and        <em>Mesartet</em> (as explained below). When parchment was the standard
        writing surface, everyday things were written on it. Nowadays, however,
        only Torah scrolls, <em>tefilin</em>, and <em>mezuzot</em> are written
        on parchment. Additionally, nowadays, animal skins are used to make
leather clothing, shoes, satchels, and upholstery. In the<em>Mishkan</em>, skins were prepared to be used as curtains as well.        <em>Mesartet</em> was performed not only on skins, but on wood as well
        - to designate a place on the boards for writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Mafshit</em>
        refers to removing the skin from an animal that was slaughtered. This
        skin has two layers. The outer layer, or <em>klaf</em>, is the material
        upon which Torah scrolls, <em>tefilin</em>, and <em>mezuzot</em> are
written. The inner layer, or <em>dokhsostos</em>, may only be used for<em>mezuzot</em>. One who separates the two layers transgresses a        <em>tolada</em> of <em>Mafshit</em>. Although one may not remove an
        animal’s skin, one may skin a cooked chicken, because the prohibition
        of <em>Mafshit</em> does not apply to edible meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Me’abed</em>
        refers to placing the skin in salt, lime, or other substances that draw
        out the skin’s juices and acids. This allows the skin to last for
        hundreds of years. Any action that prepares skins for use is included
        in this <em>melakha</em>. Therefore, one may not to stomp on skins to
        harden them, use one’s hands to soften them, or spread oil on them to
make them soft and pliant (MT 11:6). We explained above the laws of        <em>Me’abed</em> as they pertain to food (12:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Memaĥek</em>
        refers to smoothing the skins by removing hairs and irregularities.
        This <em>melakha</em> also includes smoothing any rough surface, such
        as wood or stone, by means of sandpaper or a file (<em>Shabbat</em>
        75b). It is also forbidden to scour silver items with a material that
        smooths their surface (SA 323:9). One may not scour metal with steel
        wool or sharpen knives (MB 323:40).
    </p>
    <p>
The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Memaĥek</em> has a <em>tolada</em> called        <em>Memare’aĥ</em>, which refers both to spreading a substance evenly
        upon an object and to spreading a substance on an object in order to
        smooth out the object. Therefore, one who spreads ointment on a
        poultice transgresses Torah law (<em>Shabbat</em> 75b; see below 28:8).
        It is also forbidden to spread lotions and creams on one’s body, as
        explained above (14:5). Similarly, one may not polish shoes by
        spreading cream on them. Even without a cream, one may not rub leather
        shoes in order to shine them (see AHS 327:4; SSK 15:40). As we
        explained above (12:11), according to most <em>poskim</em>, the
        prohibition of <em>Memaĥek</em> does not apply to foods.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Mesartet</em>
refers to scoring a line to facilitate writing in a straight line. This        <em>melakha</em> also includes drawing a straight line on leather,
        wood, or stone in order to mark where to cut these materials. However,
        one may use a knife to draw lines on a cake or to score an orange, to
        help one cut with precision. Since the prohibition of <em>Meĥatekh</em>
        does not apply to food (as explained above in 15:10), <em>Mesartet</em>
        does not apply to food either (MB 322:12, 18; SSK 11:15).

            R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and R. Mordechai Eliyahu maintain that
            typing on a computer is prohibited by Torah law. This would also be
            the position of those who maintain that using electricity is
prohibited by Torah law, as explained above in 17:2. See            <em>Harĥavot</em> here and there.

            According to Rema (<em>Responsa Rema</em> §119), tearing a letter
            is not considered erasing, since all parts of the letter remain but
have simply been separated from one another. However, according to            <em>Taz</em> 340:2, it is considered erasing and is prohibited.
            Based on this, SSK 9:13 prohibits opening packages if this will
            involve tearing letters. However, even within <em>Taz</em>’s
            approach, one may be lenient <em>be-di’avad</em>; as we have seen
            (ch. 9 n. 2), a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in a case of a
double rabbinic prohibition is permitted. This case is considered a            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> as well, since one has no
            interest in the letters. All he is interested in is opening the
            package. There are two factors that render the entire prohibition
            rabbinic. First, one is not erasing to enable writing in that
            space. Second, the erasing is done with a <em>shinui</em> (or
destructively). This is, in fact, the position of            <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:27:7 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 314:19. For
            the same reasons, one may walk in shoes that will leave impressions
            of letters or pictures on the ground. Here, too, there are two
            factors that render the prohibitions rabbinic. First, the "writing"
            will disappear fairly quickly. Second, this is not the normal way
            to write. Furthermore, since one has no interest in leaving
            impressions of letters in the ground, it is permitted.

            Based on this, it would seem at first glance that one should also
be allowed to cut a cake with writing on it, as this is a            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in the case of a double
            rabbinic prohibition as well. Furthermore, according to Rema, it is
            not an act of erasure but of separation. Indeed, <em>Taz</em> is
            inclined to rule this way in 340:2. <em>Dagul Me-revava</em> and a
number of other Aĥaronim also rule this way (cited in            <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §119). Nevertheless, many <em>poskim</em> are
            stringent. The reason for this would seem to be that the letters on
            a cake are noticeable and significant, and it is very clear that
            they are being erased when the cake is cut. This is what I wrote in
the main text. One may cut between the letters because most<em>poskim</em> maintain that separating letters is not considered            <em>Moĥek</em> (<em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em>; <em>Avnei Nezer</em>;
            SSK ch. 9 n. 51). In times of necessity, if it is very important to
            eat the cake and it cannot be cut without cutting through the
            letters, one may rely on those who are lenient. The status of a
            book with lettering on the edge is more complicated, as explained
            in <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            SSK 16:24 rules stringently but states in n. 66 that one does not
            have to stop a child from playing games on Shabbat, relying on
those who are lenient. This is the opinion of the majority of            <em>poskim</em>. <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:42:6 permits little girls
            to play games but not little boys, so they do not grow accustomed
            to wasting time that could be used for Torah study. He insists,
however, that for adults, games are <em>muktzeh</em>. See            <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            This disagreement hinges on several issues: 1) Is it forbidden to
            color water? According to <em>Pri Megadim</em> and MB 320:56, it is
            forbidden. However, since in this case the dye is not long-lasting,
the prohibition is rabbinic. This is the opinion of most            <em>poskim</em>. Others maintain that it is permitted, either
because the color does not become absorbed anywhere specific (<em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 1:29), or because water is a liquid, and            <em>Tzove’a</em> does not apply to liquids (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
            14:47). 2) Even if <em>Tzove’a</em> applies to water, some maintain
            that since the dyeing is done indirectly - flushing the toilet
            involves lifting the flush valve, which is considered removing an
            impediment to the water going down through the cleaner - it is a
case of <em>grama</em>. If this is correct, then this is a<em>psik reisha</em> in a case of a double rabbinic prohibition (            <em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4, p. 286). Others maintain that this
is not considered <em>grama</em>, and is therefore prohibited (            <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 320:31:3). 3) There is also a disagreement
            regarding the facts of the case. What is the purpose of the
            cleaning material - cleaning or coloring?
        </p>

In practice, those who are stringent include            <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em>, <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:13:4 and n. 9,
            and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 15:64. The latter adds that if one
            forgot to remove the container of the toilet bowl cleaner before
Shabbat, he should do so on Shabbat with his foot, because it is<em>muktzeh</em>. Those who are lenient include<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>, <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em>, and            <em>Halikhot Olam</em>. If one knows that he cares about the color
            of the water, he should be stringent.
