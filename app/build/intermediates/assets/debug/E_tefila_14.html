    Chapter Fourteen: <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Reason for Its Recital
</h2>
<p>
    The appropriate sequence of prayer is to begin by praising Hashem and only afterwards to approach Him with our requests. We learn this from Moshe Rabbeinu
    who commenced his prayer with words of praise, saying (Deuteronomy 3:24), "Hashem, God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty
    hand. What force is there in heaven or earth that can perform deeds and mighty acts as You do?" Only afterwards did Moshe plead, "Please let me cross [the
Jordan] so that I may see the good land..." Based on this, Rav Simlai interprets, "A person should always praise Hashem first and afterwards pray" (    <em>Berachot</em> 32a). This is the order of the <em>berachot</em> in the <em>Amidah</em>. The first three <em>berachot</em> open with words of praise and
    only later continue to the <em>berachot</em> detailing our requests. Even in the rest of the prayer service it is proper to begin in this fashion;
    therefore the <em>Chachamim</em> established the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, words of praise and exaltation of Hashem. The <em>Chachamim</em>
    instituted opening <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> with <em>Birkat</em> <em>Baruch She'amar</em> and ending it with <em>Birkat</em> <em>Yishtabach</em>.
</p>
<p>
During the time of the <em>Tanna'im</em>, the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> was considered to be an extra pious act praised by the    <em>Chachamim</em>. As time went on, however, the <em>minhag</em> spread until it became an obligatory custom, and now all of Israel commence their prayers
    with <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    By reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, a person reflects upon the magnitude of the Creator, and thus when he subsequently prays, he knows before Whom he
    stands. Otherwise, he might come to request his needs like idol worshipers, whose whole aim is to achieve personal success in their lowly matters, and who
    are not interested at all in devoting themselves to Hashem, the Source of Life. However, a person who purifies his heart by meditating on the greatness of
    Hashem knows how to pray. Even when requesting health and livelihood, he does so in order to devote himself to Hashem's Torah and to rectify the world
    under the Almighty's sovereignty. In this spirit, his prayers will be accepted (see <em>Olat Ra'aya</em> part 1, p.14).
</p>
<p>
    The name "<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>" means "verses of songs of praise." Additionally, it derives from the phrase "<em>zemirat hakerem</em>" (the pruning of
    a vineyard). Just like one who prunes his vineyard cuts off the extra branches in order to increase the growth of the vines and thus produce better fruit
    in the future - by saying <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> we destroy our flawed thoughts and negative feelings, so that our prayers will ascend upward and be
accepted. This process of mental and emotional purification inspires us to joyous song; therefore these passages are called "<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah.</em>"    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. What Are Pesukei d'Zimrah?
</h2>
<p>
    The main part of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> is the last six chapters in the book of Psalms, the most significant being the first, "<em>Tehillah L'David</em>
    " (Psalm 145). One who recites it three times daily is ensured a place in the World to Come, both because the praises in that Psalm are organized according
    to the order of the <em>alef-bet</em>, and because it mentions the important verse, "<em>Pote'ach et Yadecha</em>",- "You open Your hand and satisfy the
    desire of every living being" (<em>Berachot</em> 4b). It is customary to recite the verse "<em>Ashrei</em>" before it, therefore the Psalm is generally
    referred to as <em>Ashrei</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Afterwards, we say the five Psalms which start and end with the word "<em>Halleluyah</em>," about which Rabbi Yossi says, "May my portion be among those
    who complete the <em>Hallel</em> every day" (<em>Shabbat</em> 118b).
</p>
<p>
    During the era of the <em>Savora'im</em> (after the <em>Amora'im</em>), the recital of "<em>Hodu</em>" (Chronicles I 16:8-36) was instituted, which is the
    song and praise that King David recited as he returned the Ark of God from the captivity of the Philistines to the tent of the Tabernacle. Later, in the
    Temple, half of this praise would be recited while offering the morning <em>Tamid</em> and the other half when bringing the <em>Tamid</em> of the afternoon
    (<em>Beit Yosef</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 50). According to <em>Nusach</em> <em>Ashkenaz</em>, <em>Hodu</em> is said after <em>Baruch She'amar</em> so
    that all the songs of praise and exaltation are included within the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> (<em>Tur</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 51).
According to <em>Nusach</em> <em>Sephard</em>, <em>Hodu</em> is said before <em>Baruch She'amar</em> because it is a continuation of the recital of the    <em>Tamid</em> offering (<em>Eshkol</em>, <em>Kolbo</em>).
</p>
<p>
The <em>Savora'im</em> also instituted (<em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 17:11) the recital of a compilation of verses before <em>Ashrei</em> that start with    <em>Yehi Chevod</em>. These verses possess a strengthening of one's faith in Hashem and in the redemption of Israel. The <em>Ari</em> explains the deeper,
    mystical meanings of this Psalms' enigmatic words (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 51:13).
</p>
<p>
    After that, during the time of the <em>Geonim</em>, it became customary to add more Psalms and verses to <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. They established saying
"<em>Mizmor L'Todah</em>" (Psalm 100). <em>Chazal</em> say that in the future, all songs will be nullified with the exception of this one (<em>Vayikra Rabbah</em> 9:7). Therefore, it is proper to recite it with a melody. It is not said on <em>Shabbatot</em> and festivals; instead, "<em>Mizmor Shir L'Yom HaShabbat</em>" (Psalm 92) is recited. According to the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em>, <em>Mizmor L'Todah</em> is recited to correspond
to the <em>Todah</em> (thanksgiving) offering which contained <em>chametz</em> (leavened bread). For that reason this Psalm is not recited on    <em>Erev Pesach</em>, <em>Chol HaMo'ed</em> <em>Pesach</em>, and <em>Erev Yom Kippur</em>,<em> </em>since the <em>Todah</em> offering is not brought on
    those days because of the prohibition of <em>chametz</em>, or the obligation to fast. However, the <em>Sephardim</em> do recite it on those days because
    according to the <em>Sephardic</em> <em>minhag</em>, it does not correspond to the <em>Todah</em> offering; rather its fundamental purpose is to praise and
    express thanks (<em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Rama</em> 51:8).
</p>
<p>
    The main parts of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> are taken from the songs of David, as we say in the wording of <em>Baruch She'amar</em>, "Through the songs of
    David, Your servant, we will extol You." Nevertheless, in the period of the <em>Geonim</em>, there were those who had the custom to add verses from the
    Torah and from the book of Nehemiah, such as <em>Vayevarech David</em> (Chronicles I 29:10-13 and Nehemiah 9:6-11), and <em>Az Yashir</em> (Song at the
    Sea), that Moshe and the nation of Israel sang to Hashem (Exodus 15:1-18). By the end of the era of the <em>Rishonim</em> everyone became accustomed to
    saying them.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. Customs and <em>Kavanah</em> Regarding Their Recital
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>
    are to be recited in a relaxed manner and not hastily (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 51:8).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Baruch She'amar</em>
possesses a special virtue and alludes to sublime matters; therefore, it is customary to recite it while standing (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 51:1,<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 1). According to the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em>, one also stands while saying <em>Yishtabach</em>, which ends    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. However, according to the Sephardic<em> minhag</em>, one need not stand (<em>Rama</em> 51:7; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 42).
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, it is customary to stand for <em>Vayevarech David</em> until the words "<em>Asher bacharta b'Avram</em>," out of respect for the Kingdom of
    Israel founded by King David.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    After learning that one of the two reasons for the recital of <em>Ashrei</em> (Psalm 145) is the mention of the verse, "<em>Pote'ach et Yadecha</em>,"
    ("You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being"), we understand why this verse must be said with <em>kavanah</em>. If it is recited
    without <em>kavanah</em>, it must be repeated. Even if one already started reciting other passages, he must say that verse again with <em>kavanah</em>
    because it is the most important part of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. Some say that since he did not have <em>kavanah</em> for that main verse, his recital
    of the rest of the Psalm is not considered valid either, and he must go back and repeat from "<em>Pote'ach</em>" until the end (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
52:16). However, according to most <em>poskim</em>, it is enough to go back and recite only the verse "<em>Pote'ach</em>" by itself (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 52:7).<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. The Laws Concerning Interruptions in <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Because<em> Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> are surrounded by <em>berachot</em> - <em>Baruch She'amar</em> before and <em>Yishtabach</em> after them - they are
    considered one segment and interruptions in the middle of their recital are forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    However, in cases of a great need, such as to prevent loss, it is permissible to interrupt by speaking (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 51:7, where he writes
    that before and after the interruption one should say the verses "<em>Baruch Hashem</em>" that appear before <em>Vayevarech David</em>). Similarly, in
order to prevent insulting someone, one is permitted to greet him (see further in this book 16:6; the law concerning an interruption between    <em>Yishtabach</em> and <em>Barchu</em> is explained further in this book 16:2).
</p>
<p>
    There are those who say that when one must relieve himself in the middle of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, he should delay the recital of <em>Asher Yatzar</em>
    until after the prayer service so as not to interrupt <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. However, it is best to recite <em>Asher Yatzar</em> immediately after
    relieving oneself, for if he delays its recital until after praying, he might forget to say it altogether.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    If a person hears <em>berachot</em> or <em>Kaddish</em> in the middle of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, he may not answer "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>,"
although he is permitted to answer <em>Amen</em>. Saying <em>Amen</em> is allowed, but is not an obligation. Since he is engaged in the mitzvah of reciting<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, he is exempt from the mitzvah of responding to other matters of sanctity. If a person's concentration during<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> will be disturbed if he interrupts to answer <em>Amen</em>, it is best that he continues to recite <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> with    <em>kavanah</em> and refrain from answering <em>Amen</em>. However, if he hears the congregation saying <em>Kedushah</em>, he must stand with his legs
    together and join along, so that he will not stand out as one who does not participate in matters of sanctity with the congregation. Similarly, if they
    arrive at <em>Modim d'Rabbanan</em> or <em>Barchu</em>, he bows slightly and answers with them. If he is praying in a <em>minyan</em> in which the people
    are reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and he hears <em>Kedushah</em>, <em>Modim</em>, or <em>Barchu</em> being recited in a different <em>minyan</em>, he
    is permitted to remain seated and say <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, since by continuing to pray in an orderly fashion he does not stand out as one who
    separates himself from the congregation.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    One who is reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> should not be called up to the Torah. He may only be called if he is a <em>Kohen</em> or a <em>Levi</em> and
    there are no other <em>Kohanim</em> or <em>Levi'im</em> present. Additionally, since he is in the middle <em>of Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> he may not interrupt
his prayer to ask the <em>gabbai</em> (synagogue coordinator) to say a prayer on his behalf (<em>Mishebeirach</em>). However, in a situation in which the    <em>gabbai</em> mistakenly calls a <em>Yisrael</em> who is still in the middle of reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, he must go up out of respect for the
    Torah and the congregation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 51:10).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. What Parts May Be Omitted to Enable Praying in a <em>Minyan</em>?
</h2>
<p>
    When a person arrives late to synagogue and notices that the congregation is about to finish reciting <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, it is better that he omit
    some parts of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah </em>(most of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>,<em> Korbanot</em>,<em> </em>and some other passages) in order to succeed in
praying <em>Shemoneh Esrei </em>with the <em>minyan</em>, since the virtue of praying in a <em>minyan</em> is greater than the virtue of reciting    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. The whole idea behind the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> is to prepare for prayer, in order to facilitate its acceptance.
    However, the prayer of a person who prays with a <em>minyan</em> is certainly accepted and desirable (<em>Berachot</em> 8a).
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, there are passages that may not be omitted, namely, <em>Baruch She'amar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em>, and <em>Yishtabach</em>, so that the
    opportunity to recite them will not be missed. The <em>berachot</em> of<em> Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> were instituted for the purpose of reciting praise before
the <em>Amidah</em> and one who did not say them prior to it is not permitted to recite them afterwards. In order to recite the <em>berachot</em> of<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, one is obligated to recite at least one passage of praise; therefore it is best that he say the most important passage, which is    <em>Ashrei</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, one must be strict in reciting <em>Birkat</em> <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> and <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before prayer, for if he does not, he will
have lost the opportunity to say them (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:9; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> there). Likewise, before prayer one must wrap himself in a    <em>tallit</em> and put on <em>tefillin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If one notices that he does not have time to say these <em>berachot</em> and <em>Ashrei</em> and still succeed in praying with the <em>minyan</em>, he
    should pray individually without omitting anything.
</p>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
    , one should try to plan his omissions in such a way that he will succeed in praying with the congregation, meaning with ten people who are praying the
silent <em>Amidah</em>. However, if he sees that he cannot say the <em>berachot</em> and <em>Ashrei</em> and still succeed in praying the silent    <em>Amidah</em> with the congregation, he should try to pray with the <em>chazan</em> as he repeats the <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Chazarat Hashatz</em>), for
even by doing that, he is considered one who is praying in a <em>minyan</em> according to most <em>poskim</em>.    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
Whenever one must omit passages from <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, it is good to complete them after the prayer service.    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The Order of Preference Regarding Omissions
</h2>
<p>
We learned in the previous halachah that one must always recite <em>Birkat</em> <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> and <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before saying the    <em>Amidah</em>, put on <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em>, say <em>Baruch She'amar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em>, and <em>Yishtabach</em>, and continue onwards
    to <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>. Therefore, if one who is late for prayer can say those passages and still succeed in praying with the <em>chazan</em>, he
    should omit all the other parts of prayer in order to pray with the <em>minyan</em>, and after the prayer service make up what he missed. If he has more
    time before prayer, he must familiarize himself with the order of importance concerning the <em>berachot</em> and Psalms, so that he will know what to
    recite first. We will therefore outline the order of importance.
</p>
<p>
    First, one should recite all the remaining <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. Even though <em>b'dieved</em>, it is possible to complete them after the prayer
    service, in any case, since it is an absolute obligation to say them, and because the <em>Chachamim</em> say (<em>Berachot</em> 60b) that the time to
    recite them <em>l'chatchilah</em> is when one wakes up from sleep, they should be said earlier than all the Psalms and the <em>Korbanot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    When a person has more time, he should include additional Psalms according to the order of their importance. Although all the Psalms and verses are
    important, nevertheless, for the sake of prayer, there are Psalms that have more significance than others and those that have less, and we will list them
    in order of their virtue. Most valuable after <em>Ashrei</em> are the two Psalms that open with "<em>Halleluyah Hallelu</em>" (Psalms 148 and 150).
    According to <em>Rashi</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 118b), they are the main part of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, and Rabbi Yossi praises those who recite them
    every day.
</p>
<p>
    Following them in virtue are all the Psalms which begin and end with "<em>Halleluyah.</em>" According to the <em>Rif</em> and <em>Rosh</em>, they are
    called <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in the Talmud (<em>Shabbat</em> 118b), and Rabbi Yossi praises those who recite them daily. Therefore, when there is more
    time, one must say all the Psalms from <em>Ashrei</em> straight through until after the words "<em>Kol haneshamah tehallel Kah Halleluyah.</em>"
</p>
<p>
    After them in virtue are the verses of the <em>Tamid </em>offering and the verses of the <em>Ketoret</em>, because the source for their recital is based on
    the Talmud (<em>Ta'anit</em> 27b), in which it is written that anyone who recites the passages of the sacrificial offerings, is considered as if he
    actually brought them as offerings.
</p>
<p>
    Following them in importance is <em>Vayevarech David</em> (<em>Mishnah</em> <em>Berurah</em> 52:4). After that, there are varying opinions concerning which
    prayer should be recited first and the person praying can decide.
</p>
<p>
    On Shabbat, <em>Nishmat</em> precedes all the Psalms that begin with "<em>Halleluyah</em>" because it is part of <em>Yishtabach</em>. Subsequently, the
    passages that are regularly recited every day precede the passages added especially for Shabbat, for precedence is always afforded to the more frequent
    mitzvah.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
    Here is the place to add that even one who must pray individually, and shorten his prayer so that he will not be late to work, should shorten it according
    to the aforementioned instructions. For example, a teacher who wakes up late and must get to his students on time should shorten his prayer according to
    these guidelines (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 4, 91:2).

            <a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
            <em>Berachot</em>
4b states, "Whoever recites <em>Tehillah L'David</em> (<em>Ashrei</em>) three times daily is promised life in the World to Come," and            <em>Shabbat</em> 118b adds, "Rabbi Yossi says, 'May my portion be among those who complete the <em>Hallel</em> (meaning <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>)
            every day.'" From these words it can be inferred that the <em>Chachamim</em> did not institute the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>; rather, it
is an extra pious act that all of Israel practiced, and consequently became an obligatory custom. As the <em>Rasag</em> writes in his<em>siddur</em> (<em>Mekitzei Nirdamim</em> publishers, p. 32), "Our nation has volunteered to recite a number of Psalms praising<em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> - with two<em> berachot</em> before and after them..." Additionally, in the words of the <em>Rambam</em> (            <em>Tefillah</em> 7:12), "The <em>Chachamim</em> praise a person who recites songs from Psalms each and every day, from <em>Tehillah L'David</em>
            until the end of the book. It is already customary to recite verses [of Scripture] before and after them, and a <em>berachah</em> was instituted
for recital before the Psalms ... and a <em>berachah</em> after them." The wording of these <em>berachot</em> is first mentioned in <em>Seder</em><em>Rav Amram Gaon</em>, and some conclude that these <em>berachot</em> were instituted during the period of the <em>Geonim</em>. (There are even<em>poskim</em> who maintain that, halachically, <em>Baruch</em> <em>She'amar</em> and <em>Yishtabach</em> are less important than the rest of the<em>berachot</em>, as brought by the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 51:2 s.v. "<em>Im</em>"). However, <em>Tola'at Yaakov</em> writes in the name of<em>Or Zarua</em> that <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> instituted the wording of <em>Baruch She'amar</em> from a note that fell from Heaven. Many<em>Acharonim</em> write this, too, as brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 51:1. The <em>Mishkenot Yaakov</em> writes that the            <em>berachot</em> were composed during the period of the <em>Tanna'im</em> and therefore it is forbidden to skip them. Some maintain that Rabbi
Yishmael instituted them, as written in <em>Sefer Likutei Maharich</em> (see <em>Makor HaTefillot</em> p. 13). Although Rabbi Simlai learns (in            <em>Berachot</em> 32a) from Moshe Rabbeinu's prayer that a person must begin praying with words of praise, <em>Rashi</em> in <em>Avodah Zara</em>
7b interprets this to mean that we must begin the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> with three initial <em>berachot</em> of praise. So writes the            <em>Rambam</em> chapter 1, <em>halachot</em> 2 and 4. If so, there is no biblical basis for <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, rather its recital is an
            extra pious act.<em></em>
        </p>
        <p>
However, it is implied from the <em>Rif</em> (<em>Berachot</em> 23a), <em>Rosh</em> (<em>Berachot</em>, chapter 5, 4-6) and <em>Tur</em> that            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> were instituted in order to start the prayer service with words of praise. The <em>Bach</em>,<em> Orach Chaim </em>51
            explains that the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted <em>berachot</em> for <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> based on Rabbi Simlai's extrapolation from the
            verses. He reasons that although they did not obligate the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, if there was no certain teaching from the Torah
            that this was the order of prayer, they would not have instituted the recital of <em>berachot</em> for them.
        </p>
        <p>
See note 9 further in this chapter which states that according to <em>Rav Natrunai</em> and the <em>Rashba</em>, if one did not recite            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> before the <em>Amidah</em>, he may not recite them after it, for their whole purpose is to prepare a person for prayer.
However, according to <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> and the <em>Rosh</em>, one may make them up after the <em>Amidah</em>, including the<em>berachot</em>. It must be explained in their opinion, that even though they were instituted before the <em>Amidah</em>, nevertheless,            <em>b'dieved</em>, they still possess value even after the <em>Amidah</em>, for their main purpose is to praise Hashem and not necessarily to serve
            as preparation for prayer.

            See <em>Ein Ayah Berachot</em> 32a, s.v. "Rabbi Simlai extrapolates." The <em>Abudraham</em> writes that <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> are "like
defenders of prayer." In <em>Menorat HaMaor</em> it is explained that the name <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> comes from the words "            <em>zemirat hakerem</em>," meaning the pruning of a vineyard. The <em>Tur</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 93, based on the <em>Gemara</em> writes, "One
            must not approach prayer...unless it is out of happiness," and therefore it was customary to recite <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, "In order to approach
            prayer out of the happiness surrounding the mitzvah of being engaged in Torah."

Regarding <em>Tehillah L'David</em> (<em>Ashrei</em>): <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> (23a) write that the essence of the institution to recite            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> is for <em>Tehillah L'David</em>, based on the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Berachot</em> 4b. The <em>Rosh</em>, chapter 5:6
            writes, "In addition to that Psalm, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted reciting [the remaining Psalms] until the end of the book of Psalms."

What was Rabbi Yossi referring to when he said (<em>Shabbat</em> 118b), "May my portion be among those who complete the <em>Hallel</em>, [meaning            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>,] every day"? According to the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and <em>Tur</em>, he was referring to the last six Psalms,
from <em>Tehillah L'David</em> until the end of the book of Psalms (Psalms 145-150). So it is written in <em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 17:11. However,            <em>Rashi</em> interprets that Rabbi Yossi was discussing the two Psalms that start with "<em>Halleluyah Hallelu</em>" (Psalms 148 and 150). These
            opinions are brought by the <em>Beit Yosef</em>, end of section 50. Therefore, a distinction is made regarding the level of importance between the
            two Psalms that start with "<em>Halleluyah Hallelu</em>" and those that only begin with the word "<em>Halleluyah.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
In <em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 17:11 (which was redacted in Israel at the end of the period of the <em>Savora'im</em>), it is mentioned that            <em>Yehi Chevod</em>, <em>Hodu LaHashem</em>, and the last six Psalms are recited. Later, in the time of the <em>Geonim</em>, it is recorded that
we recite <em>Mizmor L'Todah</em> and the passages from <em>Vayevarech David</em> through <em>Az Yashir</em> (just as the <em>Tur</em><em>Orach Chaim</em> 51 writes, that this is an enactment of the <em>Geonim</em>). Similarly, the Psalms that are added on Shabbat are mentioned in<em>Seder Rav Amram Gaon</em>. However, regarding <em>Az Yashir</em>, which is not one of the songs of David, the <em>Rambam</em> writes (            <em>Tefillah</em> 7:13) that some are accustomed to saying it and others are not, each person according to his custom. <em>Sefer HaManhig</em>
            writes that it is not proper to skip the praise of the first redemption. The verses, "<em>Baruch Hashem l'olam amen v'amen</em>" etc. that are
recited after the <em>Halleluyot</em> are originally mentioned by the <em>Roke'ach</em> (who was among the <em>Rishonim</em> of Ashkenaz).            <em>Abudraham</em> (the <em>Sephardi</em>) presents a reason - because they are verses that conclude the book of Psalms. <em>Mizmor L'Todah</em> is
mentioned in <em>Orchot Chaim</em> (one of the <em>Rishonim</em>). Three hundred years ago, <em>Mizmor Shir Chanukat HaBayit</em> was added to the            <em>siddur</em>. Before then, it was only recited on Chanukah. In the <em>Mikdash</em>, it was recited when <em>bikurim</em> (first fruits) were
            brought (<em>Bikurim</em> 3:4).

            According to the Sephardic<em> minhag</em>, "<em>Hashem Melech Hashem Malach</em>..." is recited twice before <em>Baruch She'amar</em>, and on
            Shabbat and Festivals it is said while standing. <em>Beit Yosef</em> 50 writes in the name of <em>Shibolei HaLeket</em> 76 that the reason is based
            on the <em>Midrash</em> which states that the angels said it while standing. However, on weekdays, since people did not have leisure time because
            of work, they were not accustomed to standing. Nowadays, it is customary to stand even on weekdays.

In <em>Seder Rav Amram Gaon</em> it is written in the name of <em>Rav Natrunai Gaon</em> that the main goal is to recite the psalm            <em>Tehillah L'David</em> at least once a day, and the fact that the <em>Chachamim</em> write three times daily is so that people will not be
negligent by not reciting it at all. Therefore, in his opinion, on Shabbat it is only recited twice. This is also the implication from the            <em>Rosh</em> chapter 1, section 6, where he writes, "Whoever recites <em>Tehillah L'David</em> every day." However, in the <em>Gemara</em> before
            us (<em>Berachot</em> 4b), the version reads, "Anyone who recites <em>Tehillah L'David</em> <strong>three times</strong> daily - is promised life
            in the World to Come." So writes the <em>Rambam</em>, that it is recited three times on Shabbat as well. According to those who maintain that it is
sufficient to recite it once a day, the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 51:33 writes not to repeat "<em>Pote'ach</em>" in the middle of            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> since this is considered an interruption. Instead one should have <em>kavanah</em> while saying it in the <em>Ashrei</em>
after the <em>Amidah</em>. However, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, one must make up its recital in the middle of<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> wherever he realizes his lack of <em>kavanah</em>. This is because in addition to taking into consideration the<em>poskim</em> who maintain that it is necessary to recite it three times, the verse "<em>Pote'ach</em>" is the most important verse of            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> (as <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> 23a write) and therefore it must be recited with <em>kavanah</em> specifically
between the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. That is what the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> implies and what the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,            <em> Vayigash</em> 12, <em>Igrot Moshe</em> 2:16, and <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 5:6 write as well. According to most <em>poskim</em>, only the
verse "<em>Pote'ach</em>" must be repeated, as written in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 51:7, <em>Magen Avraham</em>, <em>Birkei Yosef</em> 5,<em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 8, and <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 12:8. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, based on the <em>Levush</em> and            <em>Chayei Adam</em>, rules that one must recite from "<em>Pote'ach</em>" until the end of the Psalm.

            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            51:8 rules that one should recite the blessing immediately and so does the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 51:28 writes that one
should recite the blessing after <em>Yishtabach</em>, and according to the <em>Eshel Avraham</em>, one should recite the blessing after the            <em>Amidah</em>. The <em>Igrot Moshe</em> 4:14 writes that it is preferable to say it after the <em>Amidah</em>. However, one who prefers to recite
            it immediately may do so. It is best that he recite the blessing immediately since there is concern that he might forget to recite the blessing
            altogether.

            <em>Shut Tzitz Eliezer</em>
            11:3 and <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 6:12 explain that all the laws of interruption concerning matters of sanctity in <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> are
            optional, meaning there is no obligation to stop in order to respond. Therefore, if responding disturbs his <em>kavanah</em>, it is best that he
does not answer. In any case, one should take care not to appear as separating himself from the congregation; therefore, he stands at            <em>Kedushah</em>, stands and bows at <em>Modim</em>, and bows slightly at <em>Barchu</em>, and since he already interrupted to stand and bow, it
            seems best that he respond as well. However, if he is part of another <em>minyan</em>, he does not appear to be separating himself from the
            congregation and therefore it is not necessary for him to stand and he may continue praying as he is (see the laws of <em>Keriat Shema</em> 16:5
            and note 4).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since a person is not obligated to respond, there is no great need to discuss the laws of interruption at length, so we will briefly mention only a
            few. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 51:8 and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> write that for responding <em>Amen</em> to <em>berachot</em> one may make an
            interruption even in the middle of a verse, provided that a theme of the verse has been concluded. However, for <em>Kaddish</em>, <em>Kedushah</em>
, and <em>Modim</em> (these parts of prayer are recited in a <em>minyan</em>, and according to <em>Minhag Ashkenaz</em>, <em>Amen</em> after<em>HaKel HaKadosh</em> and <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em> as well), he may respond even in a place in which a theme has not yet ended. Many<em>Acharonim</em> do not mention this distinction at all and maintain that it is permissible to interrupt to answer <em>Amen</em> at any point in<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. One may respond to all the <em>Amens</em> in <em>Kaddish</em> until "<em>D'Amiran B'Alma</em>," each according to his            <em>minhag</em>. However, the law concerning the subsequent <em>Amens</em> is like that of "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>," that we do not
            interrupt in order to respond in the middle of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. Regarding <em>Modim d'Rabbanan</em>, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 51:8
implies that one may answer and recite all of it, yet in <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 4, it is written that one only says the words "            <em>Modim anachnu Lach</em>." Regarding a person who hears thunder or sees lightning, according to the <em>Chayei Adam</em> 20:3 he is permitted to
            interrupt and recite a <em>berachah</em> on them, and so write most <em>poskim</em>, although there are some who disagree (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            51:23).

            A summary of this topic: <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and the <em>Tur</em> maintain that in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>
it is best to skip all of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> including its <em>berachot</em>. Even though after prayer he will not be able to recite the            <em>berachot</em> of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, it is preferable that he pray in a <em>minyan</em>, as the <em>Chachamim</em> established. The
reason for this is that prayer of the many is certainly accepted, while the basis for the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> stems from a            <em>minhag</em> that the nation of Israel practiced, and although <em>berachot</em> were instituted for them, they are not the essence of the
            prayer like <em>Birkot</em> <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>. This resembles the opinion of <em>Rasag</em> and <em>Rambam</em> brought
            in note 1. Even according to those who maintain that the reason behind the recital of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> lies in what we learn from Moshe's
            prayer, as brought there by the <em>Bach</em> in his explanation of the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and <em>Tur</em>, nevertheless, it is not
            implied that their recital is an absolute obligation, rather that all of Israel were accustomed to say them and the custom is binding, but does not
            override prayer in a <em>minyan</em>. So rules the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 52:1, <em>Rama</em>, <em>Kitzur</em> <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 14:7, as
            well as <em>Rav Rakach's Sha'arei Tefillah</em>, based on 91 <em>poskim</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast to that, many kabbalists write, based on the <em>Zohar</em>, that one must be very strict in preserving the order of the prayer
            service, for within it great secrets are hinted. Anyone who changes the order of the prayers overturns the channels of Divine influx which flow via
            prayer. Therefore, even a person who arrives late to synagogue must not skip any part of the <em>Korbanot</em> or <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. These
words are brought as halachah in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 52:2, as well as <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> part 1, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 2:6. (See<em>Shut Rav Pe'alim</em>, part 2, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 4, who agrees that in times of need one may skip part of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and            <em>Korbanot</em>). However, the <em>Chacham Tzvi</em>, responsa 36, explains that the strict attitude of the <em>Zohar</em> not to change the
            order of the prayer refers to a person praying individually, but regarding one who has the opportunity to pray with a <em>minyan</em>, it is proper
            that he skip <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in order to pray with the congregation, because even according to Kabbalah, communal prayer is most valued
            and accepted. (So write the <em>Chida</em> in <em>Kesher Shel Gudal</em> 5:10 and the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:1.)
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Mishkenot Yaakov</em> is of an intermediate opinion, that in order to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, it is best to skip all the Psalms in<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, and the <em>Korbanot</em>, on condition that he succeed in reciting the <em>berachot</em> of<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah -</em><strong> </strong><em>Baruch She'amar</em> and <em>Yishtabach</em> - for if they are not recited before the            <em>Amidah</em>, he loses out on saying them, and they are important <em>berachot</em> which were instituted in the time of the <em>Tanna'im</em>.
In order to say them, one must recite <em>Ashrei</em> between them. This is the opinion of the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:6,            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 53:2 s.v. "<em>Ein</em>," and <em>Chayei Adam</em> 19:7. That is what <em>Rav Mordechai Eliyahu</em> writes in practice in
            his <em>siddur</em>, p. 76.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although according to eminent <em>Rishonim</em> and the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> it is even preferable to skip the <em>berachot</em> in order to
pray in a <em>minyan</em>, I have not mentioned their opinion above, since there is another uncertainty involved - is the <em>Amidah</em> with the            <em>chazan</em> considered to be prayer in a <em>minyan</em>? According to the <em>Pri Megadim Eshel Avraham</em>, 52:1 praying with the chazan as
he repeats the <em>Amidah</em> is not considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, and so it is implied from the <em>Rama</em> 109:2. By contrast,            <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> and many <em>Acharonim</em> maintain that it is indeed considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em> (see earlier in this
            book 2:3, and note 2). Therefore, if skipping everything will enable a person to pray the silent <em>Amidah</em> with the congregation, it is still
            better that he recite the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and whatever sections he can and then pray with the <em>chazan</em>, for
            it is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> that his prayer is considered to be in a <em>minyan</em>. However, if there remains so little time that
            in order to pray with the <em>chazan</em> he would have to skip all of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> including the <em>berachot</em>, it is best that
he does not skip, from two standpoints: 1) According to the <em>Mishkenot Yaakov</em> and those who agree with him, a person must never skip the            <em>berachot</em> of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. 2) Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that this is not considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em> and if so,
there is no reason to skip the <em>berachot</em> for the sake of a prayer that is doubtful as to whether it is considered to be in a            <em>minyan</em>. That is what I have written above.
        </p>
        <p>
When two options stand before a person - not to skip any parts of the <em>Korbanot</em> or <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> at all and to pray with the<em>chazan</em> as he repeats the <em>Amidah</em>, or to recite select parts of the service, meaning <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, the verses of the            <em>Tamid</em> and the <em>Ketoret</em>, <em>Baruch She'amar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em>, all the <em>Halleluyot</em>, and <em>Yishtabach</em>, and
            thereby succeed in praying the silent <em>Amidah</em> with the congregation - it seems, in my humble opinion, that it is preferable to skip certain
            parts and pray with the congregation, for everyone agrees that the silent <em>Amidah</em> is considered prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, and he already
            recited the essential sections, whose sources are in the Talmud. However, if, in order to pray with the congregation, he must skip more, then in
            that case it seems to me that it is preferable to pray with the <em>chazan</em>.

The <em>Tur</em> writes in the name of <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> and the <em>Rosh</em> that a person who skipped all of            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> including the <em>berachot</em> (according to his opinion) must make them up with the <em>berachot</em> after the prayer
            service. (Although we learned in note 1 that the <em>Rosh</em> maintains that <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> were instituted as an introduction of
praise for prayer, nevertheless according to him, <em>b'dieved</em>, there is value in saying them even after prayer, as implied from<em>Rasag</em> and <em>Rambam</em> there.) By contrast, the opinion of <em>Rav Natrunai</em> is not to recite them after prayer, and so writes the            <em>Rashba</em>. The <em>Beit Yosef</em> interprets this to mean that only the <em>berachot</em> must not be recited after prayer, because their
recital was instituted as preparation for prayer, but it is correct to go back and make up the verses themselves. That is how the            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 52 rules. However, according to the <em>Bach</em> and the <em>Perishah</em>,<em> Rav Natrunai</em>'s words mean that one
            must not recite the verses either. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 5 writes that the law is that <em>shev v'al ta'aseh adif</em> (sitting and not
            performing an action is preferable.) It is also the opinion of the <em>Maharitz</em> from Yemen not to recite <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in
            accordance to the prayer service. Most <em>poskim</em> write like the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, that it is correct to make up the verses after
            prayer.

            <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em>
            9:14 and <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 6:7 discuss the precedence of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> to the rest of the <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> passages.
            Further, we shall add that the <em>Al Netilat Yadayim</em> <em>berachah</em> may not be recited after the <em>Amidah</em> either, but there is no
need to write that above, since it is normally recited at home before drying one's hands. The correct <em>minhag</em> is to recite<em>Asher Yatzar</em> and <em>Elokai Neshamah</em> immediately after that. Therefore, it is most important to remember to recite            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before praying, but if one did not, he fulfills his obligation in <em>Ahavat Olam</em>, as explained earlier in this book,
            10:2, and note 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:5 writes, based on the <em>Chayei Adam</em> 19:6, that <em>Nishmat</em> is <em>Birkat HaShir</em> (the Blessing of
            the Song), and therefore precedes all the rest. <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 9:13 writes that if one does not have time to recite <em>Nishmat</em>, he
must pray in order, for its virtue is exactly like <em>Baruch She'amar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em>, and <em>Yishtabach</em>. However, he notes that the<em>Beit Baruch</em> expresses doubt concerning this. Indeed, a number of <em>Acharonim</em> write that any Psalm recited every day precedes<em>Nishmat</em>, for they are more frequently recited (as written in <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 5:5, in the note). <em>Rav Mazuz</em> writes in his            <em>Hagahot Ish Matzliach</em> that <em>Nishmat</em> precedes all the <em>Halleluyot</em>, but is not like <em>Yishtabach</em> and <em>Ashrei</em>.
            That is the intermediate opinion and it is what I have written above.
        </p>
        <p>
            See further in <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> chapter 9, where he summarizes the order of precedence according to the Ashkenazic and Sephardic wordings. In
            addition, see <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> who suggests a different order. <em>Rav Mordechai Eliyahu</em>,<em> </em>in his<em> siddur</em>, p. 76
            presents a different order, based on <em>Rav Pe'alim</em>. I have not discussed this at length here, because most people do not remember all the
            details. Additionally, since all the other Psalms that are recited became customary after the Talmud, it is unnecessary to be so strict regarding
            the order of their importance.
