        <em> </em>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to most <em>poskim</em>, women and men are equal regarding
the obligation to pray, and therefore women are obligated to recite<em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> of <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>, while        <em>Ma’ariv</em> remains voluntary. Others maintain that women are only
        obligated to recite the <em>Amida</em> (the term for the silent
        standing prayer, used interchangeably with "<em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>"),
        once a day, preferably <em>Shaĥarit</em>, so that the day begins with
        prayer. Still others maintain that women need only recite a brief
prayer, and that <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> are sufficient to discharge this obligation.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
        , it is best for women to follow the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>
        and recite <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> every day. Still, a
        woman who only prays once fulfills her obligation, and in extenuating
circumstances, just <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar </em>suffice. A woman who is fully engrossed in
        caring for her children is permitted <em>le-khatĥila</em> to fulfill
her obligation by reciting only <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
In any case, even a woman who prays <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> must recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> (see below,
        6:1 n. 1; 7:3 n. 3).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some women are accustomed to recite the passages of the sacrificial
        offerings (<em>Korbanot</em>), and some <em>poskim</em> even say that
        women are required to recite the passage of the <em>Tamid</em>.
        Nevertheless, the <em>halakha</em> is that they are not obligated to do
        so (see below, ch. 15 n. 1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Additionally, there are <em>poskim</em> who say that women must recite        <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> (verses, mainly from Tehilim, that praise
        God) in preparation for the <em>Amida</em>; however, in practice they
        are not required to recite them (see below, 15:4).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Women are exempt from the recitation of <em>Shema</em> and its        <em>berakhot</em>, since these prayers are time-bound and women are
        exempt from positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> (see chapter 3).
        Nevertheless, a woman who recites these passages is praiseworthy. There
is an opinion that women are obligated in the daytime and nighttime        <em>mitzvot</em> of remembering the Exodus from Egypt, and according to
this opinion it is best that they fulfill this mitzva by reciting        <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> in <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Emet Ve-emuna</em>
        in <em>Ma’ariv</em>. However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that they
are not obligated to do so. Although women are exempt from reciting        <em>Shema</em>, it is good for every woman to recite the first two
        verses, "<em>Shema Yisrael</em>" and "<em>Barukh Shem,</em>" daily, so
        that she accepts upon herself the yoke of heaven (see below, 16:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from the recitation of all the prayers of supplication
        and the passages recited after the <em>Amida</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Women must say the bedtime <em>Shema</em> and recite the        <em>Ha-mapil</em> blessing (as explained below, chapter 19 n. 1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from praying <em>Musaf</em> of Shabbat, festivals, and
Rosh Ĥodesh. Some <em>poskim</em> say that just as women must pray<em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>, so too they must pray        <em>Musaf</em>, and although, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, it is proper to
        follow their opinion, the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> prevails, and
women are exempt from <em>Musaf</em>. Regarding the recitation of        <em>Hallel</em>, all opinions agree that women are exempt (see below,
        section 9).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that women have an obligation to fulfill
the mitzva of Torah reading on Shabbat; however, in practice, the        <em>halakha</em> follows most <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women
        are exempt from hearing the Shabbat Torah reading (below, section 10).

2. According to Most <em>Poskim</em> Women Are Obligated to Pray            <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages of the Mishna say that women are obligated in the mitzva of
prayer (<em>Berakhot</em> 20b). According to most <em>poskim</em>, this        <em>mishna</em> means the prayers instituted by the Sages apply to men
and women alike. Of the three daily prayers enacted by the Sages,<em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> are obligatory and        <em>Ma’ariv</em> is voluntary. However, as time went on, men accepted
        upon themselves to pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> as an obligation. Women, on
        the other hand, did not, and therefore, for them, <em>Ma’ariv</em>
        remains voluntary.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It would seem, based on the rule that exempts women from positive
        time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, that women should be exempt from prayer,
        since the obligation to pray is dependent upon time - <em>Shaĥarit</em>
        in the morning and <em>Minĥa</em> in the afternoon. However, because
        the purpose of the <em>Amida</em> is to request God’s mercy, and women
need to request mercy just like men, the Sages instituted the<em>Amida</em> for men and women alike, and women are obligated to pray        <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Women must also pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> on        <em>Shabbatot</em> and festivals. Even though the thirteen intermediate
        petitionary <em>berakhot</em> of the weekday, which constitute the
        essence of the supplication for mercy, are not recited, the Shabbat and
festival <em>Amidot </em>nevertheless include appeals for mercy like "        <em>kadsheinu be-mitzvotekha ve-ten ĥelkeinu be-Toratekha</em>…"
        ("Sanctify us with Your <em>mitzvot</em> and grant us our share in Your
        Torah…").

            3. The <em>Poskim</em> Who Maintain that Women Are Obligated to
            Pray One Daily Prayer
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some <em>poskim</em> say that according to Rambam, women are only
        obligated to pray once daily because in Rambam’s opinion, the mitzva of
        prayer is rooted in the biblical commandment to turn to God in prayer
        daily. Since this mitzva is not dependent on time, women are obligated
to fulfill it. Women are only exempt from time-bound positive        <em>mitzvot</em>, but are required to fulfill <em>mitzvot</em> that are
        independent of time. Although every day brings with it a new mitzva to
        pray, nevertheless, prayer is not considered a time-bound mitzva as all
        days are equal, without exception for festivals, Shabbat, and weekdays.
        Additionally, within the 24-hour period itself, the Torah did not fix a
        specific time for prayer; hence the biblical commandment to pray is a
        daily mitzva that is not dependent on time.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It follows, then, that the rabbinic enactment that men pray three times
        daily does not apply to women; rather, women are biblically obligated
        to pray only one prayer daily. However, since the Sages established a
        fixed prayer formula, women must fulfill their biblical commandment to
        pray by reciting the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> instituted by the Sages.
        Additionally, since the Sages set fixed times for prayer, women must
pray during one of those times, be it during the time for        <em>Shaĥarit</em>, <em>Minĥa</em>, or <em>Ma’ariv</em>.

            4. The <em>Poskim</em> Who Maintain that Women Fulfill Their
Obligation with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There are lenient <em>poskim</em> who maintain that according to
        Rambam’s opinion women are only bound by the biblical command, that is,
        they are required to recite some sort of prayer every day. They fulfill
        this mitzva with any petition to God. Therefore, when the Sages
        instituted the recitation of three prayers in the specific wording of
        eighteen <em>berakhot</em>, the enactment applied to men but not to
        women.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some <em>poskim</em> question how is it possible to fulfill one’s
        obligation with any sort of petition, for according to Rambam (MT, Laws
        of Prayer 1:2) even the sequence of the prayers is biblically mandated;
        one must begin by praising God, then beseechingly and imploringly make
        requests, and conclude by giving praise and thanks to God. This
        indicates that when the prayer is not recited in this order, one’s
        obligation is not fulfilled. So how is it possible for women to fulfill
their biblical obligation with any kind of request (        <em>Pri Megadim</em>, <em>Magen Giborim</em>)? A few Aĥaronim explain
that women may fulfill their obligation of prayer by reciting<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, for        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> open with praise, "Blessed are You, Lord our
God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His        <em>mitzvot</em>," continue with words of request, "Please Lord, our
        God, make pleasant the words of Your Torah in our mouths…and may we and
        our offspring…know Your Name and study Your Torah…," and end with
        thanksgiving, "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who
        selected us from among all the nations and gave us His Torah."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The same is true of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>. In all of the blessings
        there is praise, followed by request in <em>Ha-ma’avir Sheina</em>,
        "May it be Your will…that You accustom us to [study] Your Torah and
        attach us to Your <em>mitzvot</em>, and do not bring to error…," and at
        the conclusion, thanks, "Blessed are you God, Who bestows beneficial
        kindnesses upon His people Israel."

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Le-</em>
        <em> khatĥila</em>
it is best for women to recite the <em>Amida </em>of both        <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> every day. If they pray only once
        a day, they have fulfilled their obligation. Even though, according to
most <em>poskim</em>, women are obligated to pray both        <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>, since this is a rabbinic ruling,
        women who wish to act leniently are permitted <em>le-khatĥila</em> to
        rely upon the <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women must pray only
one daily prayer. It is best that the one prayer recited be        <em>Shaĥarit</em>, so that one begins the day with prayer. A woman who
missed <em>Shaĥarit</em> may recite <em>Minĥa</em>, and<em>be-di’avad</em>, if she missed <em>Minĥa</em>, she may pray        <em>Ma’ariv</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Women accustomed to recite only <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> have on whom to rely if necessary; however
this is not proper practice, because according to the vast majority of        <em>poskim</em>, women have an obligation to pray the <em>Amida</em> at
        least once a day.

            6. Women Occupied with the Care of Their Children
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women who are busy tending to their young children and occupied with
        managing the household are permitted <em>le-khatĥila</em> to fulfill
the mitzva of prayer by reciting only <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. As we learned (section 4 above), some        <em>poskim</em> maintain that in principle women can fulfill the
obligation of prayer with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Although under normal circumstances        <em> </em>it is not proper to rely on this opinion, nonetheless women
who are taking care of their children are permitted<em>le-khatĥila</em> to fulfill their obligation with        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Similarly R.
        Aryeh Leib, the son of R. Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Ĥafetz Ĥayim),
        attests that his mother hardly prayed at all in the years that her
        children were under her care. She said that her husband told her that
        she is exempt from prayer because she is busy raising her children.

        Even if a woman raising her children decides to go to work out of the
        need to help support the family financially, or sends her children to
        daycare, nursery, kindergarten, and school, and remains home to
        organize the house and rest a bit, since overall she is tired and busy
        with the care of her children, she may fulfill the obligation of prayer
by only reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. If it is possible for her to have<em>kavana</em> in the <em>Amida</em>, it is better that she prays the        <em>Amida</em>. Every woman may determine for herself if the burden of
caring for her children is so stressful that she cannot pray        <em>Shemoneh Esrei.</em> If this decision is too difficult for her to
        make by herself, she may consult a rabbi or <em>rabbanit</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        However, it is not proper for a woman who goes to work, not out of
        financial necessity, but because she has leisure time, to rely upon the
lenient opinion. Instead, she should be strict to pray<em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> every day, in addition to        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.

As a rule, women and men are equally obligated to perform the<em>mitzvot</em>, with the exception of time-bound positive        <em>mitzvot</em>, from most of which women are exempt, as the Sages say
        in the Mishna (<em>Kiddushin</em> 29a), "Concerning all positive
        time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, men are obligated and women are exempt."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The following are positive, time-determined <em>mitzvot</em> from which
        women are exempt: 1) The recitation of <em>Shema</em> each day and
        night (including the mitzva to remember the Exodus from Egypt, see
        below, 16:3); 2) <em>tefillin</em> of the head; 3) <em>tefillin</em> of
the arm; 4) <em>tzitzit</em>; 5) <em>sukka</em>; 6) <em>lulav</em>; 7)        <em>shofar</em>; and 8) counting the <em>Omer</em>.

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There are other positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> that are incumbent
        upon women: 1) Eating matza on Pesaĥ night (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 43b); 2)
        rejoicing on the holidays (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 109a); 3) sanctifying
        Shabbat (by making <em>kiddush</em>; <em>Berakhot</em> 20b); and 4)
        affliction on Yom Kippur (<em>Sukka</em> 28b).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to most <em>poskim</em>, women are exempt from rabbinic
        time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> as well, for all laws enacted by the Sages
        were established to resemble biblical laws. Therefore, women are exempt
        from the recitation of <em>Hallel</em> on Rosh Ĥodesh. On the other
        hand, some <em>poskim</em> maintain that women must fulfill the
rabbinic time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>. Nonetheless, everyone agrees that        <em>mitzvot</em> that were instituted by the Sages as a result of a
        miraculous event are obligatory for women, for they too participated in
        the same miracle. These <em>mitzvot</em> are: 1) Four cups of wine on
        the night of the Seder; 2) reading <em>Megilat Esther </em>on Purim;
        and 3) lighting Ĥanuka candles.

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        However, concerning all other <em>mitzvot</em>, there is no difference
between men and women, and as explained later in that <em>mishna</em> (        <em>Kiddushin</em> 29a), "All positive <em>mitzvot</em> that are not
        time-bound - both men and women must fulfill." A few examples include:
        affixing a <em>mezuza</em> to one’s doorpost, tithing <em>terumot</em>
        and <em>ma’asrot</em>, and giving loans and <em>tzedaka</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Further, the Sages say there: "Regarding all negative <em>mitzvot</em>,
        whether they are time-bound or not time-bound, both women and men are
        obligated." For example, women are commanded just like men to heed the
        prohibition of <em>ĥametz</em> on Pesaĥ and of eating and drinking on
        Yom Kippur. Despite the fact that these prohibitions are dependent on
time, women’s obligation is the same as men’s because they are negative        <em>mitzvot</em><em> </em>(<em>mitzvot</em> "<em>lo ta’aseh</em>").
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Some <em>mitzvot</em> <em>lo ta’aseh </em>pertain solely to men:        <em>bal takif</em> (the prohibition against cutting the hair from the
        corner of one’s head), <em>bal tashĥit</em> (the prohibition against
destroying the corners of one’s beard), and the prohibition on<em>kohanim</em> coming into contact with corpses (<em>Kiddushin</em>        <em>ad loc.</em>).

A woman who wishes to voluntarily fulfill the positive time-bound        <em>mitzvot</em> receives reward for doing so, although it is not the
        same as a man’s reward. As R. Ĥanina states, "Greater is the [reward
        for] one who is commanded to do and does than one who is not commanded
        and does" (<em>Kiddushin</em> 31a). Ritva explains that the reason for
        this is that one who is commanded to perform a mitzva encounters the
resistance of his; therefore his reward is greater, as the Sages say, "<em>lefum tza’ara agra</em>" (according to the torment is the reward) (        <em>m. Avot</em> 5:23).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
However, the Rishonim disagree about whether a woman may recite a        <em>berakha </em>on positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>. According to
        Rambam and several other Rishonim, women are forbidden to do so, for
        included in the <em>berakha</em> are the words, "Who has sanctified us
in His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us" ("        <em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu</em>"). How can women say
        "commanded us" ("<em>ve-tzivanu</em>") when they were not commanded?
Would this not be a needles <em>berakha </em>(<em>berakha le-vatala</em>)? SA 589:6 rules against reciting a        <em>berakha</em>, and this is the widespread practice among Sephardim.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
However, according to Rabbeinu Tam and most Rishonim, women may recite        <em>berakhot </em>on positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, for indeed,
        to a certain extent, those <em>mitzvot</em> pertain to them as well, as
        evidenced by the fact that they receive reward for fulfilling them.
        Regarding the phrasing of the <em>berakha</em>, there is no concern,
        because the word in the <em>berakha</em> is not "<em>ve-tzivani</em>
        ("commanded me," in the singular), rather "<em>ve-tzivanu</em>"
        ("commanded us," in the plural), referring to the entire Jewish people,
        of which women are part. They may therefore praise and thank God for
        sanctifying Israel through this mitzva. Rema rules accordingly, and
        this is the practice among Ashkenazim.

        Time-dependent <em>b</em><em>erakhot</em> of praise and thanksgiving,
like the <em>berakhot</em> of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and        <em>Birkhot</em> <em>Keri’at Shema</em>, may even be recited by
Sephardic women, since they do not contain the word "        <em>ve-tzivanu</em>," and indeed there is a mitzva for them to recite
        these <em>berakhot</em>. Nevertheless, R. Ovadia Yosef maintains that
according to Sephardic custom women are not permitted to recite these        <em>berakhot</em> because they are exempt from the recitation of those
        passages of prayer. He therefore asserts that in schools where both
        Ashkenazic and Sephardic girls study, it is the teachers’ obligation to
instruct the Sephardic girls not to recite the conclusion of<em>Birkhot</em> <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and <em>Birkhot </em>        <em>Keri’at Shema</em>. Still, the opinion of many <em>poskim</em> is
        that even according to the Sephardic custom it is permissible and even
        a mitzva for women to recite the <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> blessings
        and <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema </em>since they are <em>berakhot</em> of
        praise and thanksgiving. This is the common practice, so teachers need
        not instruct Sephardic girls to practice differently than their
        Ashkenazic peers, especially when such a thing will lead to confusion
        in the classroom.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
It is a biblical commandment to bring additional communal        <em>korbanot </em>(sacrificial offerings) on specific special occasions
to honor the sanctity of those times. These offerings are called "        <em>musafim</em>" (additions). To correspond to these offerings, the
        Sages instituted the recitation of the <em>Musaf</em> prayer on those
        days: Shabbat, Rosh Ĥodesh, festivals, and <em>Ĥol Ha-mo’ed</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether women must pray        <em>Musaf</em>. Some say that since in <em>Musaf</em> a request for
        mercy is made, it is therefore similar to the other obligatory prayers,
        which are obligatory for women as well according to Ramban.
        Furthermore, since these prayers were instituted in honor of the
sanctity of the day, just like women are commanded to say<em>kiddush</em> on Shabbat, so too they must pray <em>Musaf</em> (        <em>Magen Giborim</em>). Others say that because the <em>Musaf</em>
        prayer is time-dependent, women are exempt (<em>Tzlaĥ</em>). In
        practice, because this is a rabbinic mitzva, the <em>halakha</em>
follows the lenient opinion, and women are not obligated to pray        <em>Musaf</em>, although one who wishes to may do so and it is to her
        credit. On Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, it is proper that every woman
        prays <em>Musaf</em>, since the primary request for mercy on the Days
        of Awe is made in the <em>Musaf</em> prayer.

        holidays and on Ĥanuka. It is also customary to recite <em>Hallel</em>
        on Rosh Ĥodesh. Because the recitation of <em>Hallel</em> is dependent
        on time, women are exempt, although one who wishes to recite it is
        praised. As noted, Sephardic women do not make a <em>berakha</em> on

        All agree that women are exempt from Torah reading on weekdays and
        holidays; however, on Shabbat, according to MA 282:6, women must hear
        the Torah reading, for the Sages instituted that the whole Torah must
        be heard through the course of the year. Nevertheless, according to the
        overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em>, women are exempt from Torah
        reading on Shabbat, since this is a time-dependent mitzva. This is
        indeed the practical <em>halakha</em>. Still, if she is able, it is
good that a woman hear the Torah reading on Shabbat, since all        <em>poskim</em> agree that although she is exempt, if she hears it, she

            According to Ramban, who maintains that the mitzva of prayer is a
            rabbinic decree, everything instituted by the Sages regarding
            prayer applies to men and women alike, and that is the meaning
            behind the Mishna’s statement in <em>Berakhot</em> 20b that women
            are obligated to pray. The Gemara explains that since women also
            need mercy, they are required to pray even though the obligation is
            time-bound. Likewise, Rashi, Rosh, and Ra’ah maintain that women
            must pray because the purpose of prayer is to request mercy; hence,
women are required to pray both <em>Shaĥarit </em>and            <em>Minĥa</em>. MA 106:2 and MB 106:4 state that this is the
            opinion of most <em>poskim</em>. SAH<em> </em>106:2 rules this way
            as well. (According to Rashi, there is the additional reason that
            women are exempt from time-bound positive Torah <em>mitzvot</em>
            but obligated in time-bound positive rabbinic enactments.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            According to Rambam, who maintains that the mitzva of prayer is
            biblical, women are obligated, since the Torah does not specify a
            particular time for prayer. According to Rif and Rambam, there is a
            version of the Gemara which explains women’s obligation to pray
            "because it is a positive mitzva that is not time-bound." Based on
            this, many <em>poskim</em> have explained that women are obligated
            to recite one prayer, like the biblical command (see below, n. 2).
            In contrast, several prominent Aĥaronim maintain that Rambam
            obligates women to pray both <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>,
            but that <em>Ma’ariv</em> is voluntary. In their view, since the
            basis for the obligation of prayer is the same for both men and
            women, and the Sages established that the mitzva of prayer is
            fulfilled by reciting two obligatory prayers, women are also
required to do so. See Maharam ben Ĥaviv<em> </em>in<em> Kapot Temarim</em>, <em>Sha’agat Aryeh</em> §14,<em>Erekh Ha-shulĥan</em>, <em>Or Le-Tziyon </em>2:7:24,<em>Yad Peshuta</em> on MT, Laws of Prayer 1:1, and            <em>Maĥazeh Eliyahu</em> §19. All these Aĥaronim maintain that, in
            practice, women must pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>,
            since both Rambam and Ramban agree on this matter.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            See <em>Berur Halakha</em> (Zilber) OĤ 2:106, which states that
            many Rishonim agree with Rambam and maintain that prayer is a
            biblical commandment. Presumably, this contradicts what MB 106:4
            states, namely, that according to most <em>poskim</em> women are
            obligated to pray both prayers. However, in keeping with what we
            have seen, many <em>poskim </em>maintain that even according to
            Rambam, women are obligated in both prayers.

            As we saw in the previous note, according to the interpretation of
            Rif and Rambam, the Gemara states that women are obligated in
            prayer because it is a mitzva that is not time-bound. Biblically,
            there is an obligation to pray every day and the whole day is valid
            for prayer; therefore it is not bound by time. Many Aĥaronim, among
            them <em>Baĥ</em> and <em>Pri Ĥadash</em>, understand Rambam’s and
Rif’s opinion to mean that women must pray once a day. Many            <em>poskim</em> (such as <em>Pri Megadim</em>) maintain that SA
also rules accordingly. This is the ruling and explanation given in            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 6:17 and <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 3:7, where
            other Rishonim and Aĥaronim who also take this stance are

            MA 106:2 states that perhaps according to Rambam it is possible to
            fulfill the mitzva with any kind of a request, noting that it is
            upon this assumption that women who suffice with some sort of
request in the morning, rely. (It is noteworthy that also in            <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> and in <em>Me-ein Shalosh</em> there is
praise, request, and thanks, and women who recite those            <em>berakhot</em> during the day fulfill their biblical obligation
            of prayer.) However, MA adds that according to most <em>poskim</em>
            , women must pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>. Likewise,
            MB 106:4 concurs that although many women rely on the reasoning
            that it is possible to fulfill the mitzva with any kind of a
            request, it is best that they pray two prayers, as in the opinion
            of most <em>poskim</em>. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach also states that
            women customarily practice leniently by fulfilling their obligation
            with a brief prayer (<em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 2, n. 5). However, it
            can be inferred from all of the above-mentioned <em>poskim</em>
            that <em>le-khatĥila</em> one should not rely on a brief prayer.

            That is the prevalent <em>minhag</em>, attested to by R. Aryeh Leib
            in <em>Siĥot He-Ĥafetz Ĥayim</em>, 1:27. There are two reasons for
this. First, in extenuating circumstances it is possible to rely            <em>le-khatĥila</em> on the reasoning of MA. Second, some explain
            that the constant stress of tending to children’s needs falls under
            the same category of things that negate one’s <em>kavana</em>, for,
            in principle, one who is preoccupied is exempt from the mitzva of
            prayer. As the Sages say (<em>Eruvin</em> 65a), "One who returns
            from a journey is exempt from prayer for three days, and the same
            applies to other preoccupations." Similarly, SA 108:2 states that
            one should not pray where or when his <em>kavana</em> will be
            disrupted. However, in practice, SA concludes, "Nowadays we are not
cautious about this, because we do not have that much            <em>kavana</em> in our prayers today [anyway]." Still, it is
            possible that women follow the principle of the law, for since
            during the years in which they are busy tending to their children
            they are greatly hassled, much more than one who has just returned
from a trip. Therefore they do not customarily pray the            <em>Amida</em>. See similarly <em>Responsa Maĥazeh Eliyahu</em>
            20:5 in the name of Ĥazon Ish. Moreover, there is a rule that one
            who is engaged in the performance of one mitzva is exempt from the
            performance of another mitzva, and a woman who is caring for her
            children is engrossed in the continuous mitzva of <em>ĥesed</em>
            (loving-kindness). Therefore she is exempt from the mitzva of
            prayer which requires the effort of concentration. (This is
            according to Ran, as cited in BHL 38:8, s.v. "Im Tzarikh," that
even if one could exert himself and succeed in fulfilling two            <em>mitzvot</em> simultaneously, the Torah does not compel one who
            is engaged in the performance of one mitzva to perform the other
            mitzva as well.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            We have already seen (section 4) that women fulfill their
obligation of prayer by reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, for those <em>berakhot</em> incorporate
            praise, request, and thanksgiving. Additionally, <em>berakhot</em>
            do not demand as much <em>kavana</em> as the <em>Amida</em>, in
            which one stands before the King of kings. Hence, one’s
preoccupations do not significantly prevent one from reciting            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, and
            therefore all women must accustom themselves to recite them every
            day.

            However, there are different levels of preoccupation generated by
            the burden of running a household, depending on several factors:
            the number of children, their personalities and ages, whether they
            are in daycare, and how much assistance the woman has.
            Nevertheless, it is clear that if a woman is blessed with many
            children, even if she sends her children to daycare and does not
            work, the burden upon her is heavy and stressful, and she may
fulfill her obligation <em>le-khatĥila</em> with            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. If a
            working woman is able to pray while seated on her way to work,
there is uncertainty about whether it is preferable that she prays            <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> sitting or that she suffices with a short
prayer, as explained below 12:14. A woman who wants to pray the            <em>Amida</em> while sitting on a regular basis may do so.

            There are a few other <em>mitzvot</em> from which women are exempt
            for different reasons: 1. Torah study (for the sake of learning;
            however, in order to live a life of Torah women must learn. See
below 7:2); 2. writing a Torah scroll; 3. betrothal (<em>kiddushin</em>); 4. procreation (these last two<em>mitzvot</em> are actively performed by the man); 5.<em>brit mila</em> (circumcision); and 6. <em>pidyon</em>            <em>ha-ben</em> (the redemption of the first-born male). This list
            is based on Rambam’s <em>Sefer Ha-mitzvot</em>, at the end of his
            enumeration of the positive <em>mitzvot</em>. However, there is
disagreement regarding some of the laws; for example,            <em>Sha’agat Aryeh </em>§35 states that women have an obligation to
            write a Torah scroll.

According to most <em>poskim</em>, including, <em>She’iltot</em>,            <em>Tosafot</em>, Ran, Ritva, and Ra’ah, women are exempt from
            rabbinic time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, whereas according to Rashi,
            Rabbeinu Tam, and <em>Manhig</em>, women must fulfill positive
            time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> instituted by the Sages.

            The <em>mishna</em> in <em>Kiddushin</em> discusses individual
            personal <em>mitzvot</em> that women perform nowadays, but there
            are other general <em>mitzvot</em> that are different for men and
            women, such as testifying as a witness, in which only men are
            obligated, and the mitzva of war for the purpose of conquering our
            land, which pertains to men, although women are commanded to assist
            the men in fulfilling that mitzva.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In contrast, the mitzva of <em>nida</em> (the laws of family
            purity) pertains solely to women. Furthermore, women possess the
            initial entitlement to perform certain <em>mitzvot</em> before men,
            such as <em>hafrashat ĥalla</em> (tithing dough) and lighting
            Shabbat candles.

            It seems that the common practice in medieval France, Germany, and
            Provence was that women were permitted to recite blessings on
            positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>. This is also the opinion of
            Rabbeinu Tam (<em>Tosafot</em>,<em> </em>RH 33a; <em>Eruvin</em>
            96a), R. Zeraĥya Halevi, Ritz Gi’at, Ramban (on <em>Kiddushin</em>
            31a), Ran, Rashba, Ritva, Me’iri, and many others. In contrast,
            those who maintain that these <em>berakhot </em>should not be
            recited base themselves on halakhic argument, not on an attempt to
justify common practice. Rambam, <em>Smag</em>, and<em>Or Zaru’a </em>thus question how women can say "            <em>ve-tzivanu</em>." Moreover, Raavad and <em>Or Zaru’a</em>
            further maintain that the <em>halakha</em> is in accordance with
            the opinion that there is no (voluntary) mitzva for women to
            perform these actions, and the <em>berakha </em>is therefore
prohibited. According to Rid, women should not recite            <em>berakhot </em>because if they do, they will consider themselves
obligated, thereby transgressing the prohibition of "            <em>bal tosif</em>" (adding to the laws of the Torah).

            In practice, SA (589:6), which tends to rule leniently in cases of
            uncertainty concerning a <em>berakha</em>, states that women must
            not recite these <em>berakhot</em>, whereas Rema ruled, based on
the prevalent Ashkenazic custom, that women do recite a<em>berakha</em>. Even though SA teaches not to recite<em>berakhot</em> on these <em>mitzvot</em>, many Sephardic            <em>poskim</em> write, based on prevailing practice, that women do
            recite <em>berakhot</em> on positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>.
So state Ĥida and <em>Zekhor Le-Avraham</em> (cited by<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>17:4 and 589:23), and <em>Rav Pe’alim</em>,            <em>Sod Yesharim</em> 1:12 regarding the <em>berakha</em> on
            shaking the <em>lulav</em>. This is also how the family of R.
Ovadia Hadaya practiced. R.<em> </em>Messas<em> </em>(            <em>Shemesh U-magen</em> 2:72:3) writes in Morocco the custom was
            that women did not recite these <em>berakhot</em>, but a Sephardic
            woman whose custom was to recite them may continue in her practice.
            In <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 1:68 and <em>Yabi’a Omer </em>1:39-42 and
            5:43, R. Ovadia Yosef strongly reinforces the Sephardic custom not
to bless and even mentions that there are Ashkenazic<em>poskim</em> who teach not to recite the blessing, among them            <em>Ĥakham Zvi</em> and <em>Divrei Ĥayim</em>. In conclusion, every
            ethnic group should continue to follow its own custom until this
            matter is resolved by the <em>Sanhedrin</em>, which will be
            established, with God’s help, speedily in our time.

            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em>
3:3 states that Sephardic women must not recite the<em>berakhot </em>of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and so states<em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 2:6 regarding <em>Birkhot</em>            <em>Keri’at Shema</em>, because the law concerning these blessings
            resembles the law regarding the recitation of <em>berakhot</em> on
            positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>. However, according to many
Sephardic <em>poskim</em> (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>70:1;            <em>Responsa Or Le-Tziyon </em>part 2, p. 44, which states that R.
            Ezra Attia, the Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Porat Yosef, rules thus;
R. Messas<em> </em>in<em> Shemesh U-magen </em>3:63:5;            <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 7:2; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 9:2; R. Ovadia
Hadaya, and R. Mordechai Eliyahu), there is a difference between<em>berakhot</em> recited upon the performance of a mitzva and            <em>berakhot</em> of praise and thanksgiving; not only are women
            permitted to recite the latter, but it is even preferable that they
            do so. That was the practice of righteous women in the past, and
            that is how women practice in most schools today. This is also the
            consensus of virtually all Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em>,<em> </em>as
            outlined in SAH<em> </em>70:1 and AHS 70:1. MB 70:2 even cites an
opinion which states that women are obligated to recite            <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>. Since many Sephardic <em>poskim</em>
also maintain that it is best that women recite these            <em>berakhot</em>, so as not to augment distinction between the
            girls and increase dissention between the ethnic groups, it is
            proper to teach everyone to recite the blessings. Moreover, the
principle that we act leniently in uncertain matters of            <em>berakhot</em> does not apply where there is a prevailing
            custom. Nevertheless, girls who know that the women in their family
            are strict not to recite these <em>berakhot</em> should be strict
            themselves. Girls who are unsure of their family’s custom should
            practice like the rest of the girls in their class.

            It is my humble opinion that as a general rule, in a place in which
            people from all different ethnic communities live together, when
            there is difference between the different customs of the different
            ethnic groups, each ethnic group should be instructed to practice
            according to its own custom, rather than having everyone follow the
            opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em>. However, when within
            one ethnic group the law is settled and in the other there is
            disagreement, it is best that everyone practices according to the
            majority, so as not to increase conflict among the Jewish people.

            The crux of this disagreement may hinge on the dispute between
            Ramban and Rambam. According to Ramban, women must recite all
            prayers instituted by the Sages, including <em>Musaf</em>, whereas
            according to Rambam, they are only obligated in one daily prayer
            but exempt from <em>Musaf</em>, for which time is a determinative
            factor. One may argue that even according to Ramban women are
            exempt from praying <em>Musaf</em> because women are only obligated
            to recite prayers whose essence is for mercy, and the essence of
the <em>Musaf</em> prayer is the fact that it corresponds to the            <em>korban</em> <em>musaf</em> and not that it is a request for
            mercy. Moreover, since the <em>korban</em> <em>musaf</em> was taken
from the half-shekel that was given as a donation to the Temple (            <em>maĥatzit ha-shekel</em>), and women are exempt from the mitzva
to give half a shekel, they are therefore also exempt from praying            <em>Musaf</em>. Conversely, one might argue that in <em>Musaf</em>
            a request for mercy is made and therefore it pertains to women just
            like men. Furthermore, women also were granted atonement by
            bringing the <em>musaf</em> offering, and therefore they too must
            pray <em>Musaf</em>. As a rule we are lenient regarding rabbinic
uncertainties, and therefore women are exempt from praying            <em>Musaf</em>; however, if they wish to recite it, they may.
            (Still, <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> part 1, p.187, states that it is best
            that they fulfill their obligation by hearing the <em>ĥazan</em>
            recite the prayer, because these <em>berakhot</em> are dependent on
            time, and according to him, even though they are not technically
            considered <em>berakhot</em> recited upon <em>mitzvot</em>, it is
necessary in this case to be cautious not to recite a            <em>berakha le-vatala</em>. Nonetheless, he agrees that if they
            pray by themselves, they have on whom to rely, especially
concerning <em>Musaf</em> of the Days of Awe and <em>Ne’ila</em>.            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 286:7 states that the custom is that women
            pray <em>Musaf</em> just as they pray <em>Shaĥarit</em>.)

            <em>Megilla</em>
            23a states: "Every Jew can be counted among the seven people called
            up to the Torah, even a minor and even a woman, but the Sages say
            that a woman does not read the Torah out of consideration for the
            dignity of the congregation (<em>kevod ha-tzibur</em>)." MA 282:7
            states that from the fact that women can be included in principle
            among the seven people called up to the Torah, it can be inferred
that they are also obligated in Torah reading. This is explained in            <em>Sofrim</em> 18:4, where it is implied that they are even
            obligated to hear the <em>haftara</em>. Even though women are not
            obligated in the mitzva of Torah study, MA maintains that the Sages
            also instituted the reading for women so that they will hear the
whole Torah, just like they are obligated in the mitzva of            <em>hak’hel</em>. However, most <em>poskim</em> disagree, and some
            reinterpret MA to mean that it is advisable for women to hear the
reading but not compulsory. This can be inferred from<em>Tosafot</em> and Rosh, as well as other Rishonim. See also            <em>Mor U-ketzi’a</em> and AHS 282:11. MB 12 adds that there are
            places where women customarily leave the synagogue at the time of
            Torah reading.

            Rema<em> </em>88:1 writes that some women customarily do not enter
            the synagogue during menstruation (yet once the blood ceases,
            although they have not yet immersed in the <em>mikveh</em>, this
            stringency does not apply). Some <em>poskim</em> permit everything,
            and this is the accepted position. Nevertheless, people are
            stringent in practice, and only on the Days of Awe does everyone
            customarily attend the synagogue. MB 88:7 states that women
            customarily attend the synagogue but do not gaze at the Torah
            scroll while it is being lifted. It is clear that in principle it
            is permitted for a woman who is menstruating to look at the Torah
            scroll, SA<em> </em>YD 282:9 states that all people in a state of
            impurity, even <em>nidot</em>, may hold the Torah scroll and read
            from it. Many women practice this <em>le-khatĥila</em> and even at
            the time of their menstrual cycles look at the Torah while it is
            being lifted. See <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> part 1, p. 135, and below
