        1. Transforming a Public Domain
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we learned in chapter 21, one may transport items on Shabbat within
a private domain (<em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em>) but not more than four        <em>amot</em> within a public domain<em> </em>(<em>reshut ha-rabim</em>
        ) and not from a public to a private domain and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
An <em>eruv</em>, however, transforms a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em> into a        <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em>, thus allowing people to transport items
        within that area without limit, as well as to transport items from
        homes and yards into that area, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        An <em>eruv </em>has two components, one pertaining to the area that
        will be transformed into a private domain, and the other relating to
        the people who will live within the <em>eruv</em>’s boundaries. In
        order to define the area as a single private domain, it must be
        enclosed by a fence. However, this is not enough. The people who live
        within the area must also establish a partnership with one another.
        This is done by means of two meals worth of food that is owned
        collectively by everyone and from which anyone may partake. This
        communal food is called an <em>eruv</em> (literally "merging") because
        it merges or joins together all the homes and yards, turning them into
        a single private domain. Nevertheless, it has become commonplace to
        call the enclosure itself an <em>eruv </em>as well, and we follow this
        convention.
    </p>
    <p>
As we learned (21:2-3), there is a difference between a<em>reshut ha-rabim</em> by Torah law and a semipublic domain (        <em>karmelit</em>), which is treated as a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em> by
        rabbinic law. In order to permit carrying in a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em>
by Torah law, the area must be enclosed by a wall or fence at least ten        <em>tefaĥim</em> high (approximately one meter),
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn1"

            [1]
        </a>
        and the gates that people use to enter the enclosure must be locked at
        night (SA 364:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, a <em>karmelit</em>, considered a public domain on the
        rabbinic level, need not be enclosed by an actual fence. Rather, it is
        sufficient to surround it with <em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em> (defined in the
        following section) to transform it into a <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em> (SA
        362:10-11).
    </p>
    <h2>
        2. <em>Tzurat Ha-petaĥ</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have learned (21:8-9) that according to most <em>poskim</em>,
        today’s streets are considered a <em>karmelit</em>. Thus, to permit
        carrying in the streets, it is sufficient to surround them with
        structures resembling doorways (<em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em>), which form a
        kind of wall around them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic form of a doorway is comprised of two doorposts with a lintel
        atop them. A lintel can be formed by laying a board across the top of
        two posts or running a string above the posts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main requirement for a <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> is for the posts on
        the sides and the string or wire above them to be configured like a
        doorway. Since the lowest doorway is ten <em>tefaĥim</em> high, the
        poles of a <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> must be at least that high to be
        considered valid for an <em>eruv</em>. The wire extended above them
        must also be at least ten <em>tefaĥim</em> above the ground.
        Accordingly, if any part of the wire droops lower than that, the entire
        area between the poles is considered breached, since there is no actual
doorway in which any part of the lintel is lower than ten        <em>tefaĥim</em>. And if the poles are more than ten <em>amot</em>
        (4.56 m) away from one another, the entire <em>eruv </em>is
disqualified, as a breach of ten <em>amot </em>disqualifies an        <em>eruv</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the poles form the sides of the <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em>, they
        must be strong enough that a normal wind would not cause them to sway,
        and to support some type of door, even if only an extremely light one
        made of straw (SA 362:11).
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn2"

            [2]
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
According to most <em>poskim</em>, there is no limit to how wide a        <em>tzurat petaĥ</em> may be, as it can retain the basic form of a
        doorway even if it extends for a thousand <em>amot</em>. However,
        Rambam maintains that when most of the <em>eruv</em>’s perimeter is
        comprised of <em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em>, no <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> may
        extend longer than ten <em>amot</em>. <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, when
        possible, his opinion should be taken into consideration. However, in
practice, since it is very difficult to enclose towns and cities using        <em>tzurot he-petaĥ</em> that are limited to ten <em>amot</em>, we are
        lenient and do not limit the width of a <em>tzurat petaĥ</em> (SA
        362:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        The wire that is stretched between the tops of the poles must be
secured well enough that it will not become detached in a normal wind.        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, when possible, it should be stretched taut so
        that it will not even sway in the wind or droop down below the tops of
the posts, since lintels do not normally sway or droop. However,<em>be-di’avad</em>,<em> </em>even if the wire sways or droops, the        <em>eruv</em> is kosher (MB 362:65; AHS 362:37).
    </p>
    <h2>
        3. Ensuring That the Wire Is Stretched Across the Tops of the Posts and
        Electrical Poles
    </h2>
    <p>
        One must take care that the wire that serves as the lintel stretches
        over the poles, not alongside them, as in a <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ </em>
        the lintel sits atop the doorposts. Even if the post is low and the
        wire runs far above its tip (as with power lines), as long as the wire
runs directly over the post, and the post is at least ten        <em>tefaĥim</em> high, it is considered a valid doorpost, and the wire
        is considered a valid lintel. But if the wire is not directly above the
        pole, the <em>eruv</em> is invalid. If the pole is crooked, the wire
        must extend directly above the tip of the pole; if the wire is above
any other part of the pole, the <em>eruv</em> is invalid (SA 362:11; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 64).
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn3"

    </p>
    <p>
Utility poles and the cables they support cannot serve as        <em> tzurot ha-petaĥ</em>, because the cables generally do not pass
        directly over the poles, but alongside. In order to solve this problem,
        additional poles, each about a meter high, must be erected directly
        underneath the cables.

    <h2>
        4. Fences, Breaches, and a <em>Tel Ha-mitlaket</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        A fence that is ten <em>tefaĥim</em> high is considered a bona fide
        wall and is effective in transforming even a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em>
        by Torah law into a <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em> (as explained above in
        21:2-3). Even a chain-link fence is acceptable for this purpose. As
long as each of the spaces between the wires is less than three        <em>tefaĥim</em> wide, the fence is considered continuous, and it can
transform even a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em> by Torah law into a        <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a fence or series of <em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em> encloses an area but
has gaps in the perimeter, as long as each gap is less than ten        <em>amot</em> wide and the combined width of all the gaps on any side
of the perimeter is less than the combined length of the fence or        <em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em> on that side, the <em>eruv</em> is kosher (MB
        362:45; however, AHS 362:23 maintains that the lengths to compare are
        those of the entire perimeter, not just one side). In contrast, if the
        unfenced section of any side of the city is longer than the fenced
        section on that side, or if there is a gap anywhere that is longer than
        ten <em>amot</em>, the <em>eruv</em> is invalid (SA 362:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one side of the city consists of houses with yards enclosed by
        fences, with open space between the yards, then if the distance between
        each yard is less than ten <em>amot</em>, and the width of each yard is
        greater than ten <em>amot</em>, there is no need to enclose that side
        any further with a wall or <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em>. The fences
        surrounding the yards are considered walls, and the gaps of less than
        ten <em>amot</em> do not disqualify them.
    </p>
    <p>
If a city is encircled by a garden with terraces at least ten        <em>tefaĥim</em> high, then it is considered walled, and there is no
        need to add another wall or <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em>. If only part of
        the city is enclosed by a terrace, then that part needs no additional
        wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one side of a city is built on a hill, then if the hill is steep
        enough that it declines ten <em>tefaĥim</em> (76 cm) every four
        horizontal <em>amot</em> (1.824 m), it renders everything above the
slope a <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em>. The Sages refer to such a hill as a        <em> tel ha-mitlaket</em>, and it is considered a bona fide wall (SA
        345:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a town is surrounded by a fence, and the gate at the entrance road
        is wider than ten <em>amot</em>, then as long as the gate will be
        closed at night, the <em>eruv </em>is valid even when the gate is open
        (SA 364:2; <em>Melumdei Milĥama</em> §74). However, if the gate is
        generally left open at night, or if it merely serves as a barrier (or
boom gate), which, even when closed, is not a proper wall, a        <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> should be erected above the gate.
    </p>
    <h2>
        5. Forming a Partnership Using Two Meals’ Worth of Food
    </h2>
    <p>
As we have seen (section 1 above), in order to transform a<em>reshut ha-rabim</em> or <em>karmelit</em> into a        <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em> in which carrying is permitted, it is not
        enough to enclose it in a fence or <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em>. A
        partnership must also be formed among all the residents in the enclosed
        area. This is accomplished by means of bread owned jointly by every
        resident of the enclosed area. It is not necessary to use bread made
        from one of the five species of cereal grains; rice bread is also
        acceptable (SA 366:8). If fewer than eighteen people live in the
        enclosed area, it is sufficient to have enough jointly-owned bread for
        each person to have the volume of one <em>grogeret</em> (dried fig). If
there are exactly eighteen people, a volume of eighteen        <em>grogarot</em> is required, the quantity considered the equivalent
        of two meals’ worth. For a group of more than eighteen residents - even
        a thousand - the amount of bread required to form a partnership between
        all of them does not change, but remains uniform at two meals’ worth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about the precise quantity of two meals’
        worth of food. The accepted ruling is that <em>le-khatĥila</em> the
volume of eight eggs (about 400 ml) should be used, while        <em>be-di’avad</em> the volume of six eggs (about 300 ml) is sufficient
(SA 368:3). As mentioned above, this communal food is called an        <em>eruv</em> (literally "merging") because through it everyone is
merged or joined together, and their enclosed property is defined as a        <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the <em>eruv</em> bread belongs to all residents of the city, any
        of them may eat it whenever he wishes. If the <em>eruv</em> was eaten
        during Shabbat, the residents may continue to carry for all of that
Shabbat. Since the <em>eruv</em> was there during        <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> on Friday (when Shabbat began), the
partnership was already formed. For the next Shabbat, however, a new        <em>eruv</em> must be set aside.
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn5"

        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        On a kibbutz or anywhere else where all the residents eat together in a
communal dining hall, it is sufficient to erect a        <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> around the area. It is not necessary to put
        aside two meals’ worth of food in such a case, since the food in the
        communal kitchen serves to form the general partnership necessary for
        an <em>eruv</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>
        6. Setting Aside the <em>Eruv</em> and Reciting Its <em>Berakha</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is customary to use matza for the <em>eruv</em>, as it has a long
        shelf life and can continue to serve as the <em>eruv </em>for as long
as it remains edible (SA 368:5). Common practice is to set aside a new        <em>eruv</em> before Pesaĥ each year and to recite the <em>berakha</em>
        and the formula for setting aside the <em>eruv</em> of the upcoming
        year (detailed below). In many communities, the rabbi is given the
        honor of performing this ritual on behalf of the community. Even if the
        residents forgot to set aside a new <em>eruv</em> before Pesaĥ, as long
        as the old <em>eruv</em> is still in existence, one may continue
        carrying throughout the enclosed area.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>eruv</em> must be placed in one box or bag. The custom is to
        leave it in the synagogue or nearby, as the synagogue is a communal
        space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before setting aside the <em>eruv</em>, one must make sure that it
        belongs to all residents of the city. Therefore, the person charged
        with setting aside the <em>eruv</em> first lifts the <em>matzot</em>
        one <em>tefaĥ</em> with the intent to acquire them on behalf of all the
        city’s residents. In order for him to acquire the <em>matzot</em>
        successfully, they must have previously belonged to a different person.
    </p>
    <p>
Before acquiring the <em>eruv</em> and setting it aside, the following        <em>berakha</em> must be recited: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King
        of the universe, Who sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and
commanded us concerning the mitzva of <em>eruv</em>" ("        <em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu al mitzvat eruv</em>").
        Afterward, he should recite:
    </p>
    <p>
        With this <em>eruv</em> it shall be permitted to us (all the people
        living here in the town, city, or courtyard) to bring things in and out
        - from the houses to the yard and the yard to the houses, from house to
        house, from yard to yard, from roof to roof, from houses and yards to
        alleyways, and from alleyways to houses and yards in this city - for
us, all who live here, and whoever joins us during all upcoming        <em>Shabbatot</em> and holidays. (SA 365:15; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 83)
    </p>
    <h2>
        7. An <em>Eruv</em> Where Shabbat Desecrators Live
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>eruv</em>, the two meals’ worth of food that all residents
        within the enclosed area own jointly, unites all the residents and
        renders the enclosed area a private domain, where carrying is
        permitted. However, all this is on condition that all the area
        residents, without exception, are partners in the <em>eruv</em>. If any
        one of them is not interested in participating, then the area can no
        longer be considered a single domain, and the <em>eruv</em> is invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
        In light of this, it is problematic to implement an <em>eruv</em> in
        cities and towns whose residents include Jews who do not observe
        Shabbat. Since they are not interested in an <em>eruv</em>, they and
        their homes are not included in the partnership of the <em>eruv</em>,
        which means the <em>eruv</em> cannot be valid. The same problem exists
if a non-Jew lives in the area; since his home is not included in the        <em>eruv</em>, the <em>eruv </em>is invalidated (SA 385:3; 382:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution is for the Shabbat desecrator or non-Jew to rent out his
        home for Shabbat to one of the Shabbat observers. This way his home
        will be included in the <em>eruv</em> as well. The problem with this
        solution is that it is almost impossible to implement in large towns,
        let alone cities. Therefore, it became customary to use a different
        solution - renting all the homes in the area from a city official who
        has the authority to enter every house in the city (SA 391:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some argue that this solution is not viable today. In a democratic
        country, the mayor of a city does not have the right to enter the home
        of a private individual without a warrant. Still, the custom is to be
        lenient. After all, during wartime, the town major and the head of home
        front command may requisition homes of their choosing. They may even do
        so during training exercises. Therefore, these authorities have a share
        of ownership in all the homes, and one may rent their share from them
        before Shabbat for the purposes of the <em>eruv</em>.

    <h2>
        8. An <em>Eruv</em> That Becomes Invalidated on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
Sometimes it becomes apparent during Shabbat that a wire from the<em>eruv</em> has snapped in a certain place, thus invalidating the        <em>eruv</em>. Two questions then arise: 1) May the <em>eruv</em> be
        fixed on Shabbat? 2) If it turns out that the <em>eruv</em> cannot be
        fixed, do all the residents need to be informed that the <em>eruv</em>
        is down so they know not to carry?
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
, if a non-Jew is available, it is preferable that he fix the        <em>eruv</em>. Although asking a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> for
        Jews on Shabbat is rabbinically prohibited, nevertheless, when there is
        a great need to save the masses from the prohibition of carrying on
        Shabbat, the Sages permitted asking a non-Jew to fix the <em>eruv</em>,
        even if this will involve <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited by
        Torah law (MB 276:25; above 9:12).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if no non-Jew is available, a Jew certainly may not violate
        Torah prohibitions in order to fix the <em>eruv</em>. For example, if a
        pole has fallen over, a Jew may not stand it back up by jamming it into
        the ground. Similarly, if the wire has snapped, one may not tie it back
        together with a permanent knot, as tying this type of knot on Shabbat
        is forbidden by Torah law. However, the <em>poskim </em>debate whether
        one may tie a bow knot (the type used to tie shoelaces), as tying this
        type of knot on Shabbat is permissible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some argue that fixing the <em>eruv</em> on Shabbat is absolutely
        forbidden. Even though it is permissible to tie a bow knot on Shabbat,
        nevertheless in this case tying it would permit carrying on Shabbat.
This means that by tying it, one constructs a        <em>meĥitza ha-materet</em> (above, 15:4), which is forbidden on
        Shabbat. In other words, the Sages prohibited making a wall that serves
        to permit something that was previously halakhically forbidden. In this
        case, before one tied the knot it was prohibited to carry, while
        afterward it was permitted.
    </p>

        Others maintain that although the Sages generally forbade constructing
        a <em>meĥitza ha-materet</em>, nevertheless, in order to save the
masses from sinning by carrying on Shabbat, one may create a        <em>meĥitza ha-materet</em> by tying a bow knot. This is the common
custom (<em>Responsa</em> <em>Mahari Ashkenazi</em> §13;<em>Panim Me’irot</em> 1:30; <em>Sho’el U-meshiv</em>,        <em>Mahadura Tinyana </em>1:89; SSK 17:34).

        If the <em>eruv</em> cannot be fixed, this should not be announced
        publicly. This information is withheld out of concern that some people
        will carry anyway, desecrating Shabbat knowingly, and it is better that
        they transgress unknowingly rather than knowingly. The only people who
should be informed are those who will definitely follow the        <em>halakha</em> and refrain from carrying.

A <em>tefaĥ</em>, according to R. Ĥayim Naeh, is eight cm. Ten            <em>tefaĥim</em>, then, is 80 cm. He bases his calculations on
            Rambam’s opinion regarding the size of a dirhem (a unit of mass
            derived from the Greek drachma coin). However, it has since been
            ascertained that a dirhem at the time of Rambam was more than ten
            percent smaller in volume than the Turkish dirhem with which R.
            Naeh was familiar. This means that R. Naeh’s <em>shi’ur</em> is too
            large. Using the corrected measurements, a <em>tefaĥ</em> is 7.6 cm
and ten <em>tefaĥim</em> is 76 cm. Ĥazon Ish, basing himself on            <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>, maintains that a <em>tefaĥ</em> is 9.6 cm.
            The law accords with Rambam, whose opinion is accepted by the vast
            majority of <em>poskim</em>, taking into account the current
            knowledge about the size of the dirhem. Nevertheless, for two
generations, people have grown accustomed to relying on R. Naeh’s            <em>shi’ur</em>. Additionally, some follow the stringent opinion of
            Ĥazon Ish. It would seem reasonable <em>le-khatĥila</em> to follow
            Ĥazon Ish when building an <em>eruv</em> (whether enclosed by a
            fence or <em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em>), since sometimes the wire
            droops. When that happens, if the <em>eruv</em> was constructed
            based on a small <em>shi’ur</em>, its validity is uncertain. By
following Ĥazon Ish, we avoid this problem. In addition, an<em>eruv</em> is meant to serve the entire community.            <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, when acting on behalf of the entire
            community, it is more important than usual to try to meet the
            requirements of all the different opinions. In light of all this, I
            write generally that ten <em>tefaĥim</em> is approximately one
            meter (following Ĥazon Ish), even though technically one could
            follow the smaller, updated <em>shi’ur</em>. When there is a gap of
            ten <em>amot</em>, which can disqualify the <em>eruv</em>, one
            should be stringent and use the smaller, updated <em>shi’ur</em> of
            4.56 m.

            The pole that is used to form the <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> must
            look like a pole. Therefore, one should not use a wall as a pole
for this purpose (MA 363:28). However, if the            <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> is parallel to a wall and continues where
            the wall leaves off, the edge of the wall can be considered a pole
            (Ĥazon Ish 70:15; see R. Elimelech Lange, <em>Hilkhot Eruvin</em>
            4:12, p. 55).

            When erecting a low pole underneath a wire that extends high above,
            one must ensure that there is nothing between the poles and the
            wire, such as an awning. This is the position of <em>Taz</em> and
            MB 363:112. However, some are lenient <em>be-di’avad</em>,
            including AHS 363:46 and <em>Meshiv Davar</em> 1:26.
        </p>
        <p>
If a pole has a hole near the top, according to most            <em>poskim</em> one can thread the wire through it. The wire is not
            considered situated on the side of the pole, since it is still
            situated above the section of the pole below it. Even though the
            pole continues above the wire, this is not a problem. This is the
approach of AHS 362:32 and <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 7:9. However,            <em>Pri Megadim</em> and MB 362:64 are stringent. Since the pole
            continues above the wire, the wire cannot be considered situated
            above the pole. The same disagreement applies to a pole that has
            deep grooves, where the wire is wrapped around them in such a way
            that it is contained completely within the grooves. Those who are
            lenient consider the wire situated above the pole, while those who
            are stringent maintain that since the pole continues above the
            wire, the wire cannot be considered situated above the pole. In a
            time of necessity, one may rely on those who are lenient.

            When several utility poles are situated in a straight line, it is
            enough to erect <em>eruv</em> posts underneath the cables of the
            two outlying utility poles. The poles in the middle are not
            considered doorposts, but only extra supports for the lintel. This
is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, including            <em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 3:16. Nevertheless, some are stringent and
            require placing an <em>eruv</em> pole underneath every single
            utility pole, because otherwise those who see them may mistakenly
think that utility poles never need to be supplemented with            <em>eruv</em> poles.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I have written concerning utility poles is the opinion of the
            vast majority of <em>poskim</em>. A lenient opinion maintains that
            only if one constructs a <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em> but attaches the
            wire to the side of the poles does he show that he is not
            interested in constructing a valid <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em>. In
            contrast, if poles are erected for a different purpose, such as in
            the case of utility poles, and wires are attached to the sides of
these poles, this does not show that one is not interested in a            <em>tzurat ha-petaĥ</em>. Therefore, this opinion allows these
poles to be used for an <em>eruv</em> (<em>Sho’el U-meshiv</em>,            <em>Mahadura Kama </em>2:88). Some are lenient because the settings
            over which electrical wires pass are tightly connected to the
            utility pole and are considered part of it, so the wires are above
            the pole in accordance with the lenient opinion in the previous
            note. Furthermore, according to some, Rif and Rambam maintain that
            even if the wire is situated at the side of the pole, this does not
invalidate the <em>eruv</em>. This opinion is quoted in            <em>Ĥelkat Yaakov</em> 1:200. In practice, we do not use utility
            poles for <em>tzurot ha-petaĥ</em> without first making the
adjustments described above. See R. Elimelech Lange,            <em>Hilkhot Eruvin</em> ch. 4 nn. 60, 66, and 67.

            There are actually two types of "<em>eruv</em>"<em> </em>that
transform a public domain into a private domain:<em>eruv ĥatzerot</em> ("merging of courtyards") and            <em>shitufei mevo’ot </em>("sharing of alleyways"). The purpose of
an <em>eruv ĥatzerot</em> is to permit carrying in a            <em>reshut ha-yaĥid</em> that is divided into areas owned by
            different people. The Sages decreed that one should not carry from
            a home belonging to one person to a home belonging to another, even
            when both homes are a private domains. Since they belong to
            different people, the area between them resembles a public domain.
            By setting aside an <em>eruv</em> <em>ĥatzerot</em>, the homeowners
            become partners, and may carry from one home to another. The food
            for an <em>eruv ĥatzerot</em> must be placed in one of the homes
(SA 368:3), and it must consist of bread (SA 368:1). In contrast, a            <em>shitufei mevo’ot</em> is more effective, because it transforms
            all the homes, yards, and streets into one domain, within which
everyone may carry. Therefore, the food for a            <em>shitufei mevo’ot</em> does not need to be placed in a home; a
            yard can suffice. It also does not have to consist of bread; two
meals’ worth of any food is acceptable. When a<em>shitufei mevo’ot</em> is set aside, there is no need for an            <em>eruv ĥatzerot</em>. This is why nowadays the custom is to leave
            the <em>eruv </em>food in the synagogue; even though it cannot be
            considered a home, the <em>eruv</em> is valid, because it is in
fact a <em>shitufei mevo’ot</em> (SA 368:3; 386:1 and BHL            <em>ad loc</em>.). Nevertheless, since a <em>shitufei mevo’ot </em>
            can also serve as an <em>eruv ĥatzerot</em>, we make sure to use
            bread.

            In Israel, a local rabbi generally acquires ownership from the
            mayor, as well as from the chief of police. Some also do so from
            the director of the local branch of the Ministry of the Interior,
            since in an emergency the police chief is authorized to enter any
            home, while the mayor and the representative of the Ministry of the
            Interior have authority over the streets. The terms of the
            acquisition grant the rabbi permission to leave things wherever he
            wants, making him a part owner of all places within the enclosed
            area. As a result, the <em>eruv </em>can include everyone in the
            area.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be noted that we always tend to be lenient regarding the
            issue of constructing an <em>eruv</em> in a place where Shabbat
            desecrators live. This is because the prohibition on including
            non-Jews or Shabbat-desecrating Jews in an <em>eruv</em> is really
            a punitive stringency; technically, they may join with
            Shabbat-observing Jews to form an <em>eruv</em> partnership. The
            Sages wanted to discourage observant Jews from living in
            neighborhoods with Shabbat desecrators and non-Jews, so they
            penalized those who did so by forbidding such an <em>eruv</em>.
            However, if there is no alternative, we make use of any reasonable
            justification to be lenient and participate with all local
            residents in making an <em>eruv</em>. See <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 18:9;
            AHS 391:4; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> vol. 3, p. 363.

            This is the approach of <em>Maĥshavot Be-etza</em> §16. In
            principle, whenever there is a chance that people will listen, even
            if it is more likely that they will not, we do not say that "it is
            better that people transgress unknowingly rather than knowingly."
            As long as there is a chance that they will listen to reproof, we
            must reprove them (MB 608:3 based on Rosh). Accordingly, it would
seem at first glance that the public must be informed that the            <em>eruv</em> is down, as there is a chance that many people will
            follow the <em>halakha</em> and refrain from carrying.
            Nevertheless, R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach explains (SSK ch. 17 n.
            139) that carrying unknowingly in this case is considered even less
            severe than transgressing unknowingly in general; since people
            believe the <em>eruv</em> is still valid, as far as they know they
            are carrying permissibly. Thus, one who carries in such a situation
is viewed as transgressing a rabbinic prohibition obliviously (<em>mitasek</em>). Therefore, it is better not to announce that the            <em>eruv</em> is down.
