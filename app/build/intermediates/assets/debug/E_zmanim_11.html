    Chapter Eleven: Chanukah
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>11.1 – The Holiday of Chanukah is Eternal</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    During the Second Temple era, “The Greeks entered the sanctuary and defiled all the oil that was there. When the Hasmonean dynasty gained power and
    defeated them, they searched [for pure oil] and found only one flask that was marked with the seal of the High Priest, but it had enough oil only to light
    [the Menorah] one day. A miracle occurred and they lit [the Menorah] for eight days with this oil. A year later, [the Sages] established [these days] as a
holiday, making them [a time] for praise and thanksgiving,” and one may not fast or deliver eulogies on these days (<em>Shabbat</em> 21b,    <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em> 9:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Sages established many more holidays Jews during the Second Temple era, to thank God for and rejoice over the salvations He performed for Israel. They
    are all mentioned in [an ancient scroll called] <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em>. Many of these holidays commemorate the victories of the Hasmoneans, like
"Nicanor Day" – the 13<sup>th</sup> of Adar – on which the Hasmoneans defeated a large Greek army and killed their commander, Nicanor. On the 14    <sup>th</sup> of Sivan, they conquered Caesarea. On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of Elul, they killed the apostates who refused to repent. On the 23<sup>rd</sup> of
    Mar-Cheshvan, the Hasmoneans destroyed the brothel that the Greeks had built near the Holy Temple. On the 25<sup>th</sup> of the same month, they conquered
    Samaria and began settling it.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, the halachic authorities determined that [the holidays enumerated in] <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em> were annulled after the destruction of the Second
    Temple (<em>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</em> 573:1). After all, once the Temple was destroyed, all the good things that happened on these days faded away
    and there is no longer any reason to celebrate them. It is even permissible to fast and deliver eulogies on these days. Chanukah is the only holiday that
    retained its special status and remains in effect throughout the generations. The Sages explain that this is because of the special miracle that took place
with the oil-flask and the <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the candles that the Rabbi's enacted to publicize the miracle. And since we already keep the    <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the Chanukah candles, we also preserve the other aspects of the holiday: we insert <em>Al HaNissim</em> into our prayers,
recite <em>Hallel</em> to praise and thank God for saving His nation, and refrain from fasting and delivering eulogies throughout the holiday (see    <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 18b, with Rashi and Ritva).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to better understand the significance of Chanukah and the miracle of the oil-flask – the only remnants of all the holidays that existed during the
    Second Temple era – we must elaborate a bit on the events that occurred in those days and explain their meaning.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>11.2 – The Greek Empire </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Over the course of hundreds of years, the Greeks developed a culture that realized great achievements in science, philosophy, literature, art,
    architecture, military strategy, and politics. And its strength grew ever greater. After defeating his adversaries, Philippos, King of Macedonia, succeeded
    in uniting all of the Greek states under his rule. He invited the greatest Greek philosopher and scientist, Aristotle, to teach his son, Alexander. When
    Alexander [the Great] ascended the throne, he began a campaign of conquests, and within three years (3426-3429, 334-331 BCE), the Greeks conquered vast
    expanses of territory – Asia Minor, <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, Egypt, and the entire mighty Persian Empire, until India.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    After Alexander of Macedonia died, the generals of the Greek army began fighting over the throne. In the end, they divided the vast territory under their
    control into several Greek kingdoms.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    As a result of the conquests, Greek culture spread throughout the world, consuming all the other cultures and forming a singular, Hellenistic civilization.
    The system of government, language, culture, and sporting competitions in every country were Hellenistic. The rich and dignified people in every land
    assimilated with the Greeks and imitated their ways.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Judea, as well, was ruled by the Greeks, and there, too, Hellenism spread. The Jews, however, were different from all the other nations, and the process of
    Hellenization proceeded relatively slow in Judea. Nonetheless, over the course of 160 years of Greek rule, their influence grew stronger and stronger,
    mostly over the affluent. It reached the point where the High Priests, Jason and Menelaus, were leaders of the Hellenists, working to increase Greek
    influences in Judea. They built a wrestling stadium near the Holy Temple and preferred watching the matches over performing their sacrificial duties in the
    Temple.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>11.3 – Evil Decrees and Rebellion</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the year 3591 from creation (169 BCE), around 160 years after the Greeks conquered <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, Antiochus IV (Epiphanes) began oppressing the
    Jews. Under his rule, the Greeks despoiled the holy vessels of the Temple, breached the walls of Jerusalem, murdered thousands of Jews, and enslaved many
    others. In 3593 (167 BCE), Antiochus decreed that the Jews must forsake the Torah and its <em>mitzvot</em> and worship idols. He made it a capital crime to
    perform <em>mitzvot</em>, abolished the sacrificial service in the Temple, and turned the Temple into a place of idolatry. Torah scrolls were torn and
    burnt. Antiochus’ soldiers went from town to town forcing the Jews to eat pig and erect an altar for idol worship. Ritual circumcision was outlawed and
    Jewish women who insisted on circumcising their sons were executed. As a result of these decrees, many pious Jews fled to the deserts, caves, or other
    countries; and many were murdered in sanctification of God’s name.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The intense pressure that the Greeks exercised against the Jews aroused a spark in their souls, and when the Greeks arrived in the village of Modi’in, with
    the intention of forcing Matityahu son of Yochanan the High Priest to worship idols, Matityahu rose up and killed the Greek officer and his Hellenized
    collaborators. The uniqueness of his action was that instead of dying in sanctification of God’s name, like the other pious Jews, he decided to kill the
    oppressor. By doing so, he, together with his sons, raised the banner of rebellion against the Greeks and Hellenism.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The war was difficult. Yehudah the Maccabee, the bravest of Matityahu’s sons, led the fighters. With courage and skill, the Hasmoneans overcame the Greek
    forces, and after two years of fighting they succeeded in conquering Jerusalem. On the 25<sup>th</sup> of Kislev, 3596 (165 BCE), they began purifying the
    Temple and restoring the sacrificial service to its original state. This is when the oil-flask miracle took place.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Later on, the Greeks returned to <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> with reinforcements, conquered Jerusalem, and put Hellenized <em>kohanim</em> (priests) in charge
of the Temple. However, in order not to increase tensions with the Jews, they abolished the evil decrees and allowed the Jews to keep the Torah and its    <em>mitzvot</em>. But this did not stop the rebellion; the Hasmoneans continued to fight against the Greeks and Hellenism. The war effort knew ups and
    downs, but the Hasmonean brothers combined strength, diplomacy, and cunning to eventually gain political independence, decades later. Granted, the Jews
    lived under the aegis of the mighty empires – first the Greeks and then the Romans – but the governance of the Land was controlled by the Jews for the
    Jews.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It seems quite evident that had the Greeks been more patient, Judea would have succumbed to Hellenism, just like the other nations did. But the hand of
    God, which conceals itself in the historic process, generated the conflict. Just as He hardened Pharaoh’s heart during the Exodus, so too, He hardened
    Antiochus’ heart, and in the process helped Israel reveal the faith, self-sacrifice, and courage [hidden deep inside its collective soul].
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>11.4 – Trouble in the Hasmonean Dynasty</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    After the war against the Greeks ended in a military and political victory, the cultural struggle returned to the fore. We still needed to defend ourselves
    against the tremendous sea of Hellenism that engulfed all of the surrounding cultures. Greek culture was very powerful. Its methods of scientific research
    were advanced; its military strategy was excellent; its system of government was efficient; its sculptures and architectural designs impressed all who saw
    them; its plays were enchanting; and its sporting events thrilled everyone. This is why Greek culture succeeded in spreading so vigorously throughout the
    inhabited world. Hundreds of years later, when Rome had already become the major [military] power in the world, Greek culture still dominated the world,
    culturally speaking.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even though the [Hasmonean] rebellion impeded the process of Hellenization, it did not stop it entirely. A few decades later, Hellenism once again struck
deep roots among the wealthy Jews and among those who came in close contact with the Gentiles. The Hellenists of the Hasmonean era were called    <em>Tziddukim</em> (Sadducees). They did not advocate total assimilation; rather, they believed that it was possible to combine, within a Jewish national
    framework, loyalty to the Written Law and Greek culture.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One of the great tragedies of Jewish history is that the descendants of Matityahu, who sacrificed his life to fight Hellenism, got caught up with the
    Hellenists and persecuted the Sages of Israel, those defenders of our tradition. Matityahu’s great-grandson was King Yannai, who also served as High
    Priest. He was an evil man, and he reckoned that his death would gladden the Rabbis and their supporters. In order to spoil their joy, he commanded that
    immediately following his death a large number of Rabbis be executed. After he died, however, his heirs, led by his wife Shlomtzion, disobeyed his orders.
    The Rabbis established the day of his death as a joyous day of thanksgiving, marking the demise of an evildoer and the salvation of the Sages.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Eventually, Hasmoneans’ servants – foremost among them, Herod – overpowered their masters, annihilated the entire Hasmonean family, and ruled in their
    stead, to the extent that <em>Chazal</em> said, “Anyone who claims to be from the Hasmonean dynasty is either a slave or a liar” (<em>Bava Batra</em> 3b).
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Now we can understand the criticism that certain sages leveled against the Hasmoneans, accusing them of failing to appoint a king from the tribe of
    Yehudah, as the Torah prescribes: <em>The staff shall not depart from Yehudah</em> (<em>BeReishit</em> 49:10; see Ramban there). At first, the Hasmonean
    leaders were called <em>nesi’im</em> (princes), but they eventually crowned themselves as kings. They also reserved the position of High Priest for
    themselves. Clearly, their involvement in matters of state interfered with their priestly duties, blemishing the holy service, which was supposed to be
    performed in sanctity and purity, and strengthening Hellenism’s influence. From a political standpoint, as well, their kingdom was lacking, for it existed
    in the shadow of the mighty empires and, more often than not, under their auspices. This political weakness also strengthened Hellenism’s influence over
    Judea.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>11.5 – Lasting Spiritual Accomplishments </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Despite all the shortcomings, the Hasmonean victories had great value. The political independence that they won, albeit limited, contributed to the
    prosperity of the Jewish population in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> in every way. Previously, around forty percent of Judea’s produce was taken by the Greeks as
    a tax; now all of it remained in the Land, stimulating economic growth. By virtue of the victories, Jewish settlements sprung up throughout the country,
    Jews immigrated from the Diaspora, birthrates rose, and the Jewish nation, which had undergone destruction and exile, rehabilitated itself, to a large
    degree.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Through the medium of political independence, <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> became, once again, the national and spiritual center of the Jewish people. Study
halls flourished and expanded, fulfilling completely the behest of the Men of the Great Assembly: “Produce many disciples and make a fence for the Torah” (    <em>Avot</em> 1:1). The spiritual foundations of the Oral Law, which enabled Jewry to safeguard its beliefs and its Torah for 2,000 years of harsh exile,
    were laid in those days.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This is why the miracle of the oil-flask symbolizes the days of Chanukah more than anything else. Even though the Second Temple was destroyed and all the
    political achievements of the Hasmoneans were lost, the study of the Oral Law, which developed and intensified in those days, remained forever. The miracle
    of the oil-flask revealed the eternal quality of the Torah, its ability to illuminate the darkness in a supernatural way. By virtue of the Torah, we
    managed to survive the long and dark exile. The miracle of the oil-flask also revealed the Jewish nation’s unique character. It showed that we are
    different from all other nations and that it is impossible to subdue us or extinguish our faith.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the merit of their self-sacrifice, Matityahu and his sons were privileged to bring to light the deep foundations of the Torah and the uniqueness of the
    Jewish people. The Hasmonean dynasty, however, with all its problems and complexities, was a short-lived kingdom, and we do not commemorate it in a
    particularly celebratory manner.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This explains <em>Chazal</em>’s statement (<em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 18b) that the holiday of Chanukah is everlasting because of the miracle of the oil-flask
    and the Rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the candles. The oil-flask miracle showed that the military victory over the Greeks did not benefit that
    generation alone, but all generations. Therefore, the Rabbis determined that we continue observing the days of Chanukah, even though the other holidays
    mentioned in <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em> were abolished after the Temple was destroyed. Thus, in addition to the <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the candles all
    eight nights of Chanukah, we say <em>Al HaNissim</em> and <em>Hallel</em>, to thank and praise HaShem for saving us and allowing us to defeat our enemies.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Over the years, it became clear that the miracle was even greater [than we originally thought]. Not only did we manage to survive in the ocean of Hellenism
    that inundated the world, but Judaism shattered – through a long and complicated process – most of the pagan foundations of Hellenism. The abstract belief
    in one God, ethical values, the aspiration to fix the world – all fundamentals of the Torah – increasingly spread among the nations of the world,
    eventually becoming, through both direct and indirect (Christianity and Islam) means, the foundations of all that is good and pleasant in human culture.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The longer our exile lasts, the more far-reaching and brighter the light of Israel and its Torah shines. And it will continue to illuminate [the world]
until we are privileged to bring new and pure oil from the olives of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, from which we will light the <em>Menorah</em> of the    <em>Beit HaMikdash</em>, and the world will be filled with the knowledge of God, speedily in our days. Amen.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>11.6 – The Oral Law – The Light that Illuminates the Darkness </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is no coincidence that the holiday of Chanukah falls out at a time when the darkness of night reaches its peak. This period of the year is when the
nights are longest and the cold of winter permeates the land. Moreover, the moon barely shines, since Chanukah coincides with the days immediately before    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, when the moon wanes.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When the sun sets and darkness begins to envelop the land, and the long night casts its ominous, icy shadow over the world, Jews go out with candles in
    their hands and light the Chanukah lamps. This symbolizes the mighty Jewish faith, which breaks through all forms of darkness. Even in the darkest times,
    when the mightiest empires ruled the world ruthlessly, we did not despair of the light of Torah and faith, and we continued learning and teaching. A small
    ray of our light disperses a great deal of their darkness.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Chanukah is the time to rejoice over the Oral Law; firstly, because it was established [as a holiday] by the Sages [the expounders of the Oral Law], and
    also because the <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the candles was one of the first <em>mitzvot</em> the Sages enacted. Moreover, it symbolizes, generally
    speaking, the essence of the Oral Law. During the First Temple era, prophecy abounded among the Jewish people, and they studied primarily the Written Law.
    After the Temple was destroyed and prophecy ceased, however, the time came for the Oral Law [to take precedence]. The Oral Law displays the high stature of
    the Jewish people, who share in the revelation of the Torah’s light. The principles are set in the Written Law, but the Sages of the Oral Law pave the way
    for the realization of these principles. Granted, the light of the Written Law shines brighter, like the midday sun, while the light of the Oral Law
    resembles that of the moon and the stars. However, the Oral Law has the ability to descend to the hidden recesses of man’s soul and illuminate all the dark
    corners of the world. The foundations for the study of the Oral Law were laid during the Second Temple era – including all the edicts, [protective]
    “fences,” and customs. By virtue of the unique light of the Oral Law, which, similar to the Chanukah candles, illuminates the darkness, we have succeeded
    in overcoming all the difficulties of the exile.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Apparently, these ideas hidden in the holiday of Chanukah are the deep-seated reason why Jews love and cherish it so much, to the point where almost every
Jew, no matter how far removed he is from Torah observance, lights Chanukah candles. Moreover, everyone follows the custom of fulfilling this    <em>mitzvah</em> in the best possible way – <em>Mehadrin min ha’mehadrin</em> (see below 12:2).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>11.7 – A New Candle Every Day, Culminating with Eight </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Everything in the world is fleeting and eventually withers away. This is true of ideas and memories as well; they lose their strength and vitality over
    time. But behold, when it comes to lighting the Chanukah candles, we discover that faith in HaShem never wanes. On the contrary, it continues to exist and
    even thrive, despite the hardships and surrounding darkness. The pure spirituality that is manifest in the Torah is eternal; therefore, it constantly
    increases. Other ideas which are transient, however, fade away and expire. Affectionately embracing this wondrous idea, Jews are accustomed to fulfilling
    this commandment in the most exemplary manner, 'm<em>ehadrin min ha’mehadrin'</em>, adding a new candle each night so that on the final day, eight candles
    are lit.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    As is well-known, the number eight alludes to what is beyond physical nature. After all, the world was created in seven days, and there are seven days in a
    week. The number eight, on the other hand, hints to the supernatural, like <em>brit milah</em> (ritual circumcision), whose purpose is to rectify and
    elevate nature to a higher level, and therefore it is performed on the eighth day. The Torah, as well, belongs to the eighth dimension, for it comes to
    elevate nature to a divine level. This is why the Torah was given after the seven-week [<em>Sefirah</em>] count, which represents the wholeness of nature.
    After [the seven weeks of <em>Sefirah</em>], we rise to a level above nature – the holiday of <em>Shavu’ot</em>, when the Torah was given. Similarly, we
    complete the reading of the Torah on <em>Shemini Atzeret</em> (the eighth day from the beginning of <em>Sukkot</em>), which is <em>Simchat Torah</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Chanukah, as well, belongs to the realm of the supernatural, for it reveals the lofty stature of the Oral Law. Therefore, we light candles for eight
    nights, adding a new one each night.

            Additional examples: Because of the Hasmonean revolt, the wicked Antiochus went up to Jerusalem to destroy the city and annihilate the Jews. Upon
hearing troubling reports of rebellion in the eastern part of his kingdom, however, he was forced to end the siege on Jerusalem, on the 22            <sup>nd</sup> of Shevat (167 BCE). He was eventually killed in the rebellions. The 3<sup>rd</sup> of Kislev: on this day, the Hasmoneans removed
            the emblems of the Greek troops from the Holy Temple. On the 24<sup>th</sup> of Av, they reinstated Torah law as the law by which the Jews
            adjudicate themselves, instead of Greek law. The 23<sup>rd</sup> of Iyar marked the day on which Shimon son of Matityahu the Hasmonean conquered
            the Fortress of Chakra, in which there remained a Greek garrison even after Jerusalem was liberated. On the 27<sup>th</sup> of Iyar the Hasmoneans
            (apparently during the rule of Yonatan son of Matityahu) abolished the signs of idolatry that hung upon the entrances of the houses and stores. The
            15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> of Sivan: this is when the Hasmoneans conquered Beit Sha’an and drove out the heathens who oppressed the Jews.
            The Sages also established holidays when the evil kings who persecuted them died: King Yannai on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of Shevat and King Herod on the
            7<sup>th</sup> of Kislev. Many other dates are mentioned in <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em>.

            Alexander the Great died in 3437 (323 BCE). At first, Ptolemy and Seleucus fought Antigonus, defeating him in a battle near Gaza in the year 3448
            (312 BCE). The winners divided the spoils, and Ptolemy took Egypt, while Seleucus received Syria and Babylonia. Later on, the two fought each other
            over <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, and the Ptolemy dynasty prevailed, taking control of the Holy Land for over a hundred years, starting in 3459 (301
            BCE). In the year 3562 (198 BCE), Antiochus III, a descendant of the Seleucus dynasty, conquered <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, but his power waned toward
            the end of his life. He attempted to conquer the Pergamon kingdom in Asia Minor, but the Romans intervened on their behalf and defeated Antiochus,
            who was forced to pay heavy compensation fees. Antiochus Epiphanes, the wicked king who enacted evil decrees against the Jews, took the reigns of
            power after his namesake’s demise (3584-3596, 176-164 BCE). (Most of the information in this and the following footnotes is taken from Dr.
            Mordechai Breuer’s <em>Divrei HaYamim LeYisrael U’leUmot HaOlam</em>, Mossad HaRav Kook Publishers.)

            On the thirteenth of Adar 3599 (161 BCE), the troops of Yehudah the Maccabee defeated the army of Nicanor; Nicanor was killed and the remnants of
            his troops retreated. This day was celebrated for generations. Immediately thereafter, the Greeks sent Bacchides at the head of a large army.
            Yehudah, unable to mobilize a great number of fighters, stood against him with a mere 800 soldiers. Yehudah was killed in this battle (3600, 160
            BCE). Bacchides conquered the entire Land and awarded the position of High Priest to Alcimus, a Hellenist, who executed sixty of Israel’s elder
            sages. Yonatan, Yehudah’s brother, assumed command of the remaining Hasmonean fighters, who fled and went into hiding. Over time, the Hasmoneans
            regained their strength and managed to harass the Greeks, but they were unable to re-conquer Jerusalem. Then, a threat arose against King
            Demetrius’ rule, and [in order to maintain his power] he made a pact with the Hasmoneans, giving them Jerusalem and autonomy. Yonatan took
            advantage of the struggle for power in the Seleucid dynasty and received additional benefits from Demetrius’ rival. Thus, in the year 3608 (152
            BCE), the Hellenist administrators of the Holy Temple were deposed and Yonatan began serving as High Priest. Diodotus Tryphon, one of the Greek
            rulers who opposed Yonatan’s increasing power in Jerusalem, lured him into joining him for friendly talks and then murdered him (3618, 142 BCE).
            Shimon inherited his brother’s command and made a treaty with Tryphon’s rival, in exchange for a tax exemption for the Jews of Judea. While the
            Greek kings were preoccupied with internal battles, Shimon cleansed the Land of the vestiges of Greek influence, conquered the Fortress of Chakra
            (Iyar 23, 3619; 141 BCE; the date was established as a holiday), conquered additional cities surrounding Judea, and fortified its political
            independence. When Antiochus Sidetes defeated his enemies and no longer needed Shimon’s aid, he instigated a conspiracy against him, and indeed,
            Shimon’s son-in-law, Ptolemy, rose up and murdered Shimon, along with two of his sons (3625, 135 BCE). With Antiochus Sidetes’ help, Ptolemy tried
            to take control of Judea, but Yochanan Hyrcanus, Shimon’s faithful son, fought him. Then, Antiochus Sidetes came to assist Ptolemy the murderer,
            pillaging Judea and bringing Jerusalem under heavy siege. However, Sidetes was forced to retreat because of revolts that sprang up against him
            elsewhere. He accepted Yochanan’s peace proposal, which stated that the Jews would pay a heavy tax to the Greeks in exchange for partial autonomy.
            Yochanan was appointed High Priests and Nasi (President). Shortly thereafter, Antiochus Sidetes’ army was crushed by the Parthians and Sidetes
            himself was killed. At this time, Yochanan began conquering additional territory in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, in order to expand Jewish settlement at
            the expense of that of the Gentiles and to cleanse the Land of idolatry. These conquests brought the Jews wealth and economic prosperity. Yochanan
            ruled Judea for thirty-one years (3625-3656, 135-104 BCE), acting righteously most of his days and strengthening the Sanhedrin. At the end of his
            life, however, he joined the Sadducees.

            After the death of Yochanan Hyrcanus (3656, 104 BCE), troubles began. His heirs did not obey his last will; his oldest son, Yehudah Aristobulus, an
            ally of the Sadducees, acted like a Hellenist ruler, throwing his mother and brother in jail and declaring himself King and High Priest. He died a
            year later, after which his brother Alexander Yannai reigned for 27 years. He was a Sadducee, who favored the Hellenists and fought against the
            Pharisees (rabbinic Jews). However, he continued to extend the borders of Israel. He repented towards the end of his life, realizing that his ties
            with the Sadducees undermined Jewish nationalism. He therefore commanded that his righteous wife, Shlomtzion, sister of Shimon ben Shetach, inherit
            his thrown. She reigned for nine years (3684-3693, 76-67 BCE). After her death, a bitter civil war broke out between her two sons, Hyrcanus and
            Aristobulus (who were educated by their father, Yannai the Sadducee). In the year 3695 (65 BCE), the two brothers turned to Pompeius, the Roman
            delegate, to mediate between them. Two years later, Pompeius and his army invaded Judea, abolished the Hasmonean dynasty, and diminished the
boundaries of the Land. He allowed Hyrcanus to retain his position of High Priest and leader of the Jews in Judea, giving over the rest of            <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> to autonomous gentile rule, subordinate to agents of Rome. In the course of time, Antipater the Idumean (from Edom), who was
            one of Hyrcanus’ adherents, established ties with the Romans and became their trusted ally, eventually taking control of Judea. After he died, his
            son Herod continued in his ways. Since Herod helped Hyrcanus defeat his nephew, Hyrcanus gave him his granddaughter Miriam’s hand in marriage. This
            enabled Herod to eventually claim the Hasmonean throne. In the year 3720 (40 BCE), the Parthians conquered <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and Aristobulus’
            son seized control of Judea, all the while taking revenge on his uncle Hyrcanus. Herod fled to Rome, where he was [officially] appointed King of
            Judea. Armed with Roman troops, he returned to the Holy Land and re-conquered it. This began his 36-year reign. He murdered his opponents and
            anyone else who might be a threat to his authority, including the members of the Hasmonean family, and even some of his own sons. When Herod died,
            in 3757 (4 BCE), the Sages established the day of his death – the seventh of Kislev – as a holiday. Nevertheless, the Rambam considered his kingdom
            to be [genuine] Jewish sovereignty, as he writes in <em>Hilchot Chanukah</em> (3:1): In the merit of the Hasmonean victory, “sovereignty returned
            to the Jewish people for over two hundred years.” The Rambam teaches us here that even Herod’s reign was better than the oppression that preceded
            the rebellion and the subjugation that followed the destruction of the Second Temple.

            We express our thanks by saying <em>Al HaNissim</em> in <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and <em>Birkat HaMazone</em> (Grace after Meals). This prayer
            emphasizes the victory over the Greeks, who wanted to make us forget the Torah and its commandments. HaShem came to our aid and delivered the
            strong and wicked into the hands of the few and righteous. Afterwards, we purified the Temple and lit the lamps. No mention is made of the miracle
            of the oil-flask.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Rambam (3:1) further emphasizes the national-political victory: “During the Second Temple [era], the Greek kings enacted [evil] decrees against
            the Jews. They abolished their religion, prevented them from engaging in [the study of] Torah and [the performance of] <em>mitzvot</em>, stole
            their money and daughters, entered the Sanctuary, made breaches in it, defiled that which was pure, caused the Jews great distress, and pressured
            them sorely; until the God of their forefathers had mercy on them, delivered them from the hands [of the Greeks], and saved them. The Hasmonean
            High Priests overpowered [the Greeks], killed them, and delivered the Jews from their hands. They then appointed a king from among the priests, and
            sovereignty returned to the Jews for over two hundred years, until the second destruction.”

            That is, the miracle of the oil-flask symbolizes the triumph of faith and Torah [over Hellenism]. It is the basis for the fact that Chanukah is a
            perpetual holiday. However, we would not have been privileged to receive the everlasting [<em>mitzvah</em> of] lighting the candles or the triumph
            of faith if not for the miracle of the [military] victory – the righteous defeating the wicked – and the [other] national achievements, as
            described in <em>Al HaNissim</em>. This is why we praise God [specifically] through the recitation of <em>Hallel</em>. After all, [the Rabbis]
            prescribed the saying of <em>Hallel</em> mainly to commemorate times when the Jews were delivered from bondage or saved from death. Hence, the
Rambam emphasizes the nationalistic aspects [of Chanukah]. This also explains why the Rambam emphasizes the joy of Chanukah, as he writes in            <em>Halachah</em> 3: “Because of [these events], the Sages of that generation decreed that these eight days, beginning with the 25<sup>th</sup> of
            Kislev, be days of joy and praise (<em>hallel</em>); and we light the candles on them…” (It is possible to say that the Rambam considers the
            [military] victory to be the primary miracle, contrary to what I wrote in the first <em>halachah</em> [of this chapter] based on [the opinion of]
            several <em>Rishonim</em>.)

            Second Temple era prepared the Jews for the [subsequent] exile, by absorbing sacred vitality [from the Temple and integrating it] into the Oral Law
            [which accompanied the Jews into exile]. See also the essay entitled <em>Chacham Adif MiNavi</em>, and <em>Orot HaTorah</em>, chap. 1.

            See the Maharal’s <em>Tiferet Yisrael</em>, chap. 2 and 25 (end), and <em>Ner Mitzvah</em> p. 23. The Greeks’ worldview stemmed from nature, and
            since nature has different forces, they believed in multiple gods. In addition, since nature has no values, just strength, beauty, and external
            wisdom, they yearned for these things. In contrast, Judaism is based on the belief in one God, Who created and transcends nature. The goal is to
            discover God’s oneness in the world, to reveal the image of God within man by way of morals, Torah, and <em>mitzvot</em>. The Greeks cannot coexist
            with us, because our belief in one God and our ethical values undermine the foundation of their worldview. Judaism, however, can coexist with Greek
            culture and use it as a tool for research, classification, and the revelation of Jewish concepts. For more on this, see <em>Binah LeItim</em>, vol.
            1, chap. 25-27.
