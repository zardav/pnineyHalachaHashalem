    Chapter One: Fundamentals of the Laws of Prayer
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    Prayer is one of the principal expressions of belief in Hashem. People are not perfect; they are flawed and long to improve themselves. They therefore turn
    to the Creator of the World in prayer.
</p>
<p>
    Human imperfection is apparent on two levels. Most people only feel a need to pray to Hashem when their daily routines are disrupted. For example, when
    someone is ill or injured and his pain intensifies, when he understands that all the doctors in the world cannot guarantee his health and well-being, and
    only <em>HaKadosh Baruch</em> <em>Hu</em>, in Whose hands is the soul of every living thing, can cure him and grant him a long happy life - then he prays
    to Hashem from the depths of his heart to heal him. So it is, whenever a calamity befalls a person, his livelihood suffers, enemies rise against him, or
    his close friends turn their backs on him. He then understands how the good things in his life hang in a balance and he turns to Hashem to help and save
    him. However, when daily routines function in their usual proper manner, most people do not detect anything missing and generally do not feel a need to
    pray to Hashem.
</p>
<p>
    Those who delve more deeply understand that even their everyday lives are not perfect. Even when they are healthy and earning a steady income, their family
    life is good, their friends are loyal and the situation in their country is stable, even then, perceptive people sense their existential inadequacy. They
    know that their lives are limited and even if all goes well, there will come a day when they die of old age. Now, too, when they are young and strong, they
    are unable to comprehend everything in their lives, and not everything turns out the way they intended. They cannot achieve all of their aspirations or
    fully attain even one goal. Out of this sense of inadequacy, they turn to <em>HaKadosh Baruch</em> <em>Hu</em>, the God of the heavens and the earth, the
    only One Who can redeem them from their imperfection. By connecting with God in prayer, people begin the process of fulfillment and redemption.

    2. The Prayers of Our Ancestors and Prophets
</h2>
<p>
    We learn in the <em>Tanach</em> that whenever our ancestors and the prophets needed help, they turned to Hashem in prayer.
</p>
<p>
    Avraham Avinu stood in prayer and begged that Sodom not be destroyed. Hashem answered him that if there were ten righteous people in Sodom the city would
    be saved. But ten righteous people were not to be found there, and Sodom was demolished (Genesis 18). Childless for many years, Yitzchak Avinu and Rivkah
    Imeinu, pleaded to Hashem in prayer and were answered with the birth of Yaakov and Eisav (Genesis 25). Yaakov Avinu prayed for Hashem to save him from his
    brother, Eisav, who set out against him with four hundred warriors, and he was answered and saved (Genesis 32). Following the sin of the Golden Calf,
    Hashem's wrath rose up against the nation of Israel, and Moshe Rabbeinu prayed intensely until Hashem canceled the decree of disaster that He had
    threatened to bring on His people (Exodus 32). When Miriam, Moshe's sister, fell ill with leprosy, Moshe stood and prayed, "<em>Kel na refa na lah</em>"
    ("O God, please heal her!") and she was healed (Numbers 12). To turn back a Heaven-sent plague, Aharon used the incense to pray, and the plague ceased
    (Numbers 17). After the army of Israel was defeated by Ai, Hashem heard Yehoshua's prayers and guided him to correct the sin of Achan, after which they won
    their next battles (Joshua 7). When the Philistines waged war against Israel, Shmuel cried out to Hashem for help on behalf of the nation. In answer,
    Hashem led him and Israel to defeat and conquer the Philistines (I Samuel 7). David, the king of Israel, would often pray to Hashem; his prayers eventually
    became the Book of Psalms. After Shlomoh finished building the Temple, he prayed that the <em>Shechinah</em> dwell therein, and that all people who pray
    there would be answered, and Hashem accepted his prayer (I Kings 8-9). When Eliyahu the Prophet fought against the false prophets of Ba'al on Mount Carmel,
    he prayed that fire would descend from the sky and so it transpired (I Kings 18). Likewise, Elisha the Prophet prayed to Hashem that He revive the son of
    the Shunamite woman, and the boy came back to life (II Kings 4). When Chizkiyah faced death from his disease, he too prayed to Hashem and was cured (II
    Kings 20).
</p>
<p>
    One of the prayers that left a lasting impression on all generations is the prayer of Chanah. Barren for years, she would often pray at the Tabernacle in
    Shiloh and was the first to refer to Hashem in her prayer by the holy name "<em>Tzevakot</em>." Eventually, she merited a son, none other than Shmuel the
    Prophet (I Samuel 2). Shmuel the Prophet is said to have been equal to Moshe and Aharon. Through Moshe and Aharon, the word of Hashem was revealed in the
    transcendental miraculous life of the Jews in the desert and through Shmuel, the word of Hashem was revealed in the tangible reality of the nation of
    Israel living in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>. Shmuel unified the nation, founded the kingdom of David, reared a generation of prophets in Israel, and through
    his inspiration the Temple was built. Shmuel's great and lofty soul was difficult to bring it down to earth and Chanah needed to pray intensely until she
    was worthy of giving birth to him. Her prayer is so important that <em>Chazal</em> learn numerous laws from it (<em>Berachot</em> 31a).
</p>

    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>The Effect of Prayer </strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>
    established a law in Creation, that when we awaken in the world below to approach the Almighty and request a blessing from Him, He, in turn, is aroused
from above to bring upon us an abundance of good, according to our needs and the requirements of the world. This is mentioned in the    <em>Zohar HaKadosh</em> in many places.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, even when people are worthy that Hashem shower them with goodness, sometimes the giving is delayed until they feel the weight of their
    hardships and pray to Hashem from the depths of their hearts.
</p>
<p>
    There are two types of prayer.
</p>
<p>
    The first is for the continual existence of the world; without prayer, the world would cease to exist. This kind of prayer parallels the <em>Tamid</em>
    sacrifice, the merit of which sustains the heavens and the earth (see <em>Ta'anit</em> 27b).
</p>
<p>
    The second type of prayer concerns specific circumstances, such as when disaster strikes and people pray for salvation, or when people pray for something
    they desire.
</p>
<p>
    Every prayer has an influential effect, as Rabbi Chanina says, "Whoever lengthens his prayer, his prayers do not return unanswered" (<em>Berachot</em>
32b). Sometimes the effect is immediate, and other times in the distant future; sometimes the prayer is answered completely, other times partially. As    <em>Chazal</em> say (<em>Devarim</em> <em>Rabbah</em> 8:1), "Great is prayer before <em>HaKadosh</em> <em>Baruch Hu</em>. Rabbi Elazar says, If you want to
    know the power of prayer - if it does not accomplish everything, it achieves half." <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> is the One Who knows how to help and
    support a person. Sometimes, for various reasons, a person's misfortune is for his own good, and therefore Hashem does not accept his prayer. Nevertheless,
    his prayer benefits him, and its blessing will be revealed in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
    Even the most righteous people, whose prayers were generally accepted, sometimes went unanswered. For instance, even though Hashem accepted Moshe
    Rabbeinu's prayers to forgive the Nation and annul His decree of destruction when Israel sinned by creating the Golden Calf and sending out spies who
    returned with a negative report about the Land of Israel, (Exodus 32 and Numbers 14) when Moshe came to beg on behalf of himself to merit entering the
    Land, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> said to him, "Enough! Do not talk to me further about this matter" (Deuteronomy 3:26).
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, a person must exert himself greatly in prayer, and not assume that since he is praying, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> must fulfill his request.
    Rather, he should continue praying, knowing that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> hears his prayers and that his prayers are most certainly doing some good,
    although how much, and in what way, are unknown.
</p>

    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>Is Prayer a Biblical Obligation? </strong>
</h2>
<p>
The <em>Rishonim</em> disagree as to whether there is a biblical commandment (<em>mitzvah</em> <em>m'd'oraita</em>) to pray every day. According to the    <em>Rambam</em> (<em>Sefer</em> <em>HaMitzvot</em>, mitzvah 5), there is a biblical commandment to pray daily, as it says (Exodus 23:25), "Serve God your
    Lord," and (Deuteronomy 6:13) "Remain in awe of God, serve Him." Although these verses contain a general commandment to serve Hashem, they also include a
    specific commandment to pray. The <em>Chachamim</em> interpreted 'service' (<em>avodah</em>) to mean prayer, as it is written (Deuteronomy 11:13), "Love
    God your Lord and serve Him with all your heart," and they explained (<em>Ta'anit</em> 2a), "What is serving with the heart? You must say, [it means]
    prayer." By praying once a day, a person fulfills his biblical obligation to pray. To fulfill one's obligation, one must commence his prayer with praise to
    Hashem; after that ask for what he needs; and conclude by thanking Hashem for the good He has bestowed upon him. The Torah does not specify how long one's
    prayers must be. Therefore, some shorten their prayers and others lengthen them, yet they all fulfill their biblical obligation (<em>Rambam Tefillah</em>
    1:2-3).
</p>
<p>
    However, according to the <em>Ramban</em> (<em>Hasagot</em> on <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>), there is no biblical obligation to pray every day, because, in
his opinion, the extrapolation from the verses that the <em>Rambam</em> mentions is not complete, but rather only an <em>asmachta</em> (reference).    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> instituted the daily prayers. Only during times of trouble is there a biblical commandment to pray to Hashem, as we learn
    from the mitzvah of the trumpets (<em>chatzotzrot</em>), where it says (Numbers 10:9), "When you go to war against an enemy that attacks you in your land,
    you shall sound a <em>teruah</em> (short blasts) on the trumpets. You will then be remembered before God your Lord, and will be delivered from your
    enemies."
</p>
<p>
    Hence, according to all opinions, there is a biblical obligation to pray in times of trouble. Therefore, anyone who finds himself, or his friend, in a
    state of crisis is required to add a special request for assistance in his prayer, since it is a biblical commandment to pray to Hashem that He save him
from that trouble. All the more so when the public or the nation is in danger; it is a mitzvah for the <em>tzibur </em>(public) to pray a communal prayer;    <em>Chazal</em> even instituted fast days for that reason.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    <strong>5. </strong>
    <strong>The Institution of Prayer by <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em></strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>
    instituted the prayers and the blessings (<em>Berachot</em> 33a). They established the wording of the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and decided on the phrasing
    of all the <em>berachot</em>, including <em>Birkot Keriat Shema </em>and <em>Birkot HaNehenin</em> (blessings recited upon deriving pleasure from
    something). They also instituted the recital of the three daily prayers, <em>Shacharit</em>, <em>Minchah</em>, and <em>Ma'ariv</em> - <em>Shacharit</em>
    and <em>Minchah</em> as obligatory and <em>Ma'ariv </em>as optional.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
The members of the court of Ezra HaSofer, which was established in the beginning of the time of the Second Temple, are called    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>. This was the biggest court ever founded in Israel. It was comprised of 120 elders, among them prophets and sages, such
    as, Chagai, Zechariah, Malachi, Daniel, Chananyah, Misha'el, Azariah, Nechemiah the son of Chachaliah, Mordechai, Bilshan, and Zerubavel, as well as many
    other sages, the last one being Shimon HaTzaddik (<em>Rambam</em>'s introduction to <em>Mishneh Torah</em>).
</p>
<p>
    During the time of the First Temple, <em>Am Yisrael</em> merited supreme spiritual accomplishments; the <em>Shechinah</em> dwelled in the Temple and the
    devoutly pious of Israel merited prophecy. Despite this, throughout most of the nation, grave sins including idol worship, forbidden relations and murder,
    were widespread and eventually caused the Temple to be destroyed and the nation of Israel to be exiled. Hence, when they were able to build the Second
    Temple, <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah </em>formed a supreme court, set boundaries to guard the laws of the Torah, instituted religious guidelines, and
    worded and arranged the prayers and <em>berachot</em>. They created a full framework for Jewish life which gave expression to the values of the Torah in an
    organized and established manner within everyday living, thereby distancing the nation from sin and bringing them closer to serving Hashem.
</p>
<p>
    Even in the time of the First Temple the nation of Israel prayed to Hashem and thanked Him for all the good and blessing they received. However, that
prayer did not have an organized wording. Since there was no exact text, the righteous and devout people would pray and recite <em>berachot</em> with great    <em> kavanah </em>(intent), but the masses of the nation would exempt themselves with superficial prayers. Indeed, passionate prayer from the heart in
    one's own words is the ideal method of prayer. Yet, in actuality, the routine concerns of everyday life wear us out, and without regular organized prayers,
    the public gradually drifts away from prayer services and eventually from Hashem. Following the establishment of the prayers and their fixed wording, all
    of Israel started to pray, and as a result, faith in Hashem intensified. This is what preserved the nation's devotion, which remained a burning flame in
    the darkness of exile for two thousand years
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, during the time of the First Temple, many people mistakenly thought that by offering sacrifices, their sins would be forgiven and they would
    merit Hashem's blessing, even if they did not purify their hearts and correct their transgressions. The truth is that faith in Hashem, purification of the
    heart, and correcting one's actions are of principal importance, as it says (Deuteronomy 10:12), "What does Hashem want of you? Only that you remain in awe
    of Hashem your God, so that you will follow all His paths and love Him, serving Hashem your God with all your heart and with all your soul." The prophets
    severely condemned those who believed that the essence was to bring sacrifices without possessing and demonstrating true devotion to Hashem. As it is
    written (Isaiah 1:11-13), "'Why do I need all your sacrifices?' God asks. 'I am sated with your burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts [brought
    without repentance or sincerity], and I have no desire for the blood of cattle, sheep, and goats. When you appear before Me, who asked you to do this,
trampling My courts? Do not bring any more vain offerings; the incense of abomination they are to Me'.'" By instituting the prayers,    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> restored the proper order to serving Hashem, reminding us that faith,<em> </em>intent, and devotion are the basis of our
    lives, and they are expressed most appropriately via prayer, just as Rabbi Elazar said, "Prayer is greater than sacrifices" (<em>Berachot</em> 32b). With
    that in mind, we pray that we should be worthy of expressing our devotion to Hashem completely, both in prayer and in sacrifice.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    <strong>6. </strong>
    <strong>The Standardized Wording (<em>Nusach</em>)</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Establishing a uniform wording, which repeats itself throughout the three daily prayers, created a certain disadvantage. As a result, prayer is liable to
    become routine and a person is apt to lose the<em> kavanah</em> that is aroused within him when he prays before Hashem in his own words. On the other hand,
    had <em>Chazal</em> not established a fixed wording, though the righteous would pray beautiful and sincere prayers from the depths of their hearts, most
    people would pray brief and inadequate prayers.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Rambam</em> explains (<em>Hilchot Tefillah</em> 1:4) that especially after the destruction of the First Temple and the exile of Israel among the
    nations, the problem worsened. Many Jews lost their proficiency in Hebrew, the language of prayer. At the same time, in other languages, no appropriate
    wording for prayer existed. Therefore, <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> established the wording for all the <em>berachot</em> and prayers so that they
    would be fluent in every mouth, and so that the subject of every <em>berachah</em> would be clear to all.
</p>
<p>
    Another advantage to a fixed wording of prayer is that it includes all the general and specific requests for which it is proper to pray. Without an
    organized wording, every person would pray about a particular topic of personal importance. Doctors would pray for the health of their patients, farmers
    would pray for rain, and with time, every Jew would likely pray only for the matters close to his or her heart, while distancing oneself from the
    collective aspirations of the nation. Therefore, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted eighteen <em>berachot</em>, which incorporate all of <em>Am Yisrael</em>
    's goals, both material and spiritual. In so doing, every person praying three times each day balances his personal ambitions and unites them with the
    overall desires of the nation.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the actual meaning of the content of our supplications, the wordings of the prayers possess innumerable profound meanings, a few of which
    are clarified in the wisdom of the Kabbalah. As Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin writes (<em>Nefesh HaChaim</em> 2:10), "And the wise person will understand on his
    own why 120 sages, among them prophets, were needed to institute a small plea or short prayer. Through Divine inspiration and supreme prophecy, they
grasped the order of creation and the deep mysteries of the '<em>pirkei merkavah</em>.' This is why they established and instituted a formula for the    <em>berachot</em> and the prayers using these specific words - for they observed and understood in which way the light of each individual word would
    illuminate the powers of creations, and how each formula was absolutely necessary to properly rectify transcendental spiritual worlds, supreme forces, and
    the '<em>siddur merkavah</em>.'"
</p>
<p>
    Further, he writes (ibid., 2:13) that all the explanations which have been revealed to us by the <em>Arizal</em> and other holy figures are only a drop in
    the sea compared to the depth of the inner<em> </em>intentions of <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>, who instituted the prayers. Through the prophecy and
    Divine inspiration that appeared to them when they established the wording of the prayers and <em>berachot</em>, they successfully included in concise form
    the rectification of all the worlds (<em>tikun ha'olamot</em>) in such a way that every day new repairs (<em>tikunim</em>) are amended.
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    <strong>7. </strong>
    <strong>Establishing Three Prayers</strong>
</h2>
<p>
In addition to the special prayers that our forefathers prayed during times of trouble, they also fixed set times when they prayed to Hashem (    <em>Berachot</em> 26b). Avraham Avinu initiated the <em>Shacharit</em> morning prayer. He was the one who originally illuminated the world with his belief,
    and accordingly set the time of his prayer when the sun starts to rise. Yitzchak Avinu founded the <em>Minchah</em> afternoon prayer. Yitzchak had the
    unique ability to continue in the way of Avraham his father. Sometimes it is easier to break away onto a new path rather than carry on in the same one.
    Yitzchak's strength was that he remained in the path of faith, corresponding to the <em>Minchah</em> prayer, which expresses continuity, for the whole day
    is sustained by the power of faith. Yaakov Avinu formulated the <em>Ma'ariv</em> evening prayer because Yaakov dealt with many hardships and complications,
    yet from each of them he emerged stronger. He therefore established the nighttime prayer, since, even in the dark when reality is clouded, it is possible
    to connect to <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, thereby revealing the supreme eternal light.
</p>
<p>
After the forefathers paved the way with these prayers, there were devout and righteous people who followed in their path and prayed <em>Shacharit</em>,    <em>Minchah</em>, and <em>Ma'ariv</em>. As King David said (Psalms 55:17-18), "As for me, I call out to the Lord, and God saves me. Evening, morning, and
    noon, I express my grief and moan aloud, and He hears my voice."
</p>
<p>
    Following in the custom of our forefathers, <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> established the three prayers, <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em> as
    obligatory, and <em>Ma'ariv </em>as optional. They were set up to correspond to the communal offerings, since the prayers came to express the inner
    significance of the sacrifices. Since the prayers were established to correspond to the sacrifices, the times of the prayers were set according to the
    times of the offerings (as explained further in this book 11:4, 11:11, 24:3-4, and 25:2).
</p>
<p>
Because the <em>Tamid</em> sacrifices of the morning and of the afternoon were obligatory, <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em> are obligatory prayers.    <em>Ma'ariv</em> was established to represent the burning of the fat and organs, which were put on the altar at night. If one did not bring them, it did
    not prevent him from fulfilling the mitzvah<em> </em>of the offering. Therefore <em>Ma'ariv</em> was also deemed optional. However, as time passed, the
nation of Israel took upon itself to recite <em>Ma'ariv</em> as an obligatory prayer (see further in this book 25:2). On Shabbat, festivals, and    <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, we were commanded to bring a <em>Musaf</em> sacrifice; hence, the <em>Chachamim </em>established the recital of the <em>Musaf</em>
    prayer to represent it.
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    <strong>8. </strong>
    <strong><em>Kavanah</em></strong>
    <strong> and Those Who Find It Difficult to Concentrate </strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Prayer is considered <em>avodah shebalev </em>(service of the heart); therefore its essence is dependent upon<em> kavanah</em> (intent). There are two
    kinds of <em>kavanah</em> in prayer: one, a general<em> kavanah</em>, that the person praying is standing before the King of Kings and is filled with fear
    and love; and the second is a personal<em> kavanah</em>, that he concentrates in his heart on the words he is saying.
</p>
<p>
    People are innately different from one another. Some can concentrate effortlessly, and though they repeat the same words every day, it is easy for them to
    recite all the words and mean them. Others, by nature, find it difficult to concentrate, and the more familiar a subject is to them, the harder it is for
them to concentrate on it. Try as they might to have<em> kavanah</em>, their thoughts wander from one matter to the next. Despite great effort to have    <em> kavanah</em> in <em>Birkat Avot</em>, their reveries take over, and to their surprise they are already saying <em>Birkat</em> <em>Selach Lanu</em>.
Again, they attempt to concentrate for another <em>berachah</em>, but their minds fly off on another journey, and suddenly they find themselves bowing at    <em>Modim</em>.
</p>
<p>
Even in the time of the Talmud there were <em>Amora'im</em> who complained about the difficulty of having<em> kavanah</em> while praying. The    <em>Yerushalmi</em> (<em>Berachot</em>, chapter 2, halachah 4), teaches that Rabbi Chiya said of himself that he was never able to have<em> kavanah</em>
    throughout his entire prayer. Once, when he tried to concentrate during his prayer, he began to ponder who is more important before the king, this minister
    or that one. Shmuel said, "I counted newly hatched chicks while I was praying." Rabbi Bon Bar Chiya said: "While I was praying I counted the rows of the
building." Rabbi Matanyah said, "I am grateful for my head, for even when I am not paying attention to what I am saying, it knows by itself to bow at    <em>Modim</em>." The commentary <em>Pnei Moshe</em> explains that these rabbis were busy learning Torah and therefore had trouble concentrating. In any
    case, we learn that it is difficult to have<em> kavanah</em> from the beginning of the prayer service until the end. Even though we must try as hard as we
    can to concentrate, one should not feel dispirited when he does not have the proper<em> kavanah</em>. Even a person who dreamt throughout most of his
    prayer should not despair; rather he should strive to have<em> kavanah</em> while reciting the remaining <em>berachot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    A person should not say, "If I do not have<em> kavanah</em>, perhaps it is better not to pray." The very fact that he came to pray before Hashem expresses
    something very profound - his sincere desire to connect to Hashem and to pray before Him. Every person is measured according to his nature, and at times,
    someone who finds it difficult to concentrate, yet struggles and succeeds in having<em> kavanah</em> for a number of blessings, is more praiseworthy than
    someone who easily succeeds in concentrating throughout the entire prayer service. Additionally, people who find it easy to concentrate on the routine
    prayers generally pray without any particular passion, even on special occasions, or when a tragedy befalls them. However, those individuals who find it
    difficult to concentrate on the routine words usually succeed in attaining higher levels of<em> kavanah</em> in exceptional circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    It is said in the name of the <em>Ari HaKadosh</em> that<em> kavanah</em> is like wings upon which prayer soars heavenward and is accepted. When a person
    prays without<em> kavanah</em>, his prayer lacks the wings with which to fly upwards and it waits until the person prays with<em> kavanah</em>. When he
    succeeds in doing so, all the prayers that he recited without<em> kavanah</em> ascend to Hashem together with the prayer that achieved <em>kavanah</em>.
    The reason for this is clear: the very fact that the person initially came to pray demonstrates that he wants to connect to Hashem, praise Him, and asks
    Him for his needs. He simply failed to have<em> kavanah. </em>However, the moment he succeeds in having <em>kavanah</em>, he opens the gate for all his
    prayers to ascend.
</p>
<p>
    According to halachah, anyone who has<em> kavanah</em> in his heart while saying the first verse<em> </em>of <em>Shema</em> and the first <em>berachah</em>
of the <em>Shemoneh</em> <em>Esrei</em> fulfills his obligation, even if he does not have<em> kavanah</em> while saying the rest of his prayers (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, 63:4, 101:1; further in this book 15:6 and 17:9).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    <strong>9. </strong>
    <strong>Hearing the Words One Utters and the Law of <em>Hirhur</em> </strong>
</h2>
<p>
Some <em>mitzvot</em> are fulfilled through <em>dibur</em> (speech), such as prayer, the recital of <em>Shema</em>, and <em>Birkat HaMazon</em>. The    <em>Amora'im</em> are divided on the question of whether one can fulfill these <em>mitzvot</em> <em>b'dieved</em> (after the fact), via <em>hirhur</em>
    (thought). According to Ravina,<em> hirhur k'dibur</em> (thought is like speech) and one who thinks the words of the prayer or <em>berachah</em> in his
mind has fulfilled his obligation. In contrast to him, Rav Chisda asserts that thought is not equivalent to speech (<em>Berachot</em> 20b). Although some    <em>poskim</em> maintain that <em>hirhur k'dibur</em>, (<em>Rambam</em>, <em>Smag</em>, <em>Riaz</em>), in practice, most <em>Rishonim</em> hold that the
halachah follows Rav Chisda's opinion that thought is not like speech (<em>Rach</em>, <em>Talmidei Rabbi Yonah</em>, <em>Or Zarua</em>, <em>Rosh</em>,<em>Raavad</em>, and more). This is also how the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> rules regarding the recital of <em>Shema</em> (62:3) and    <em>berachot</em> (185:2 and 206:3).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    If a person mouthed the words, even though he did not hear the words he said, he fulfilled his obligation <em>b'dieved</em> because he moved his lips.
    However, <em>l'chatchilah</em> (from the outset), concerning every mitzvah that is fulfilled by speech, the person speaking must hear what he is saying.
</p>
<p>
    There are parts of prayer which are said by the whole congregation, such as the answering of <em>Amen</em> and the <em>Kedushah</em>, in which the
    congregation responds to the <em>chazan</em>. These sections of prayer are, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, said aloud. We must be especially careful to answer to
the <em>Kaddish</em> out loud because when everyone says <em>Amen</em> in unison, <em>kevod Shamayim </em>(the respect of Heaven) is magnified (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 56:1). The <em>Chachamim</em> tell us that by answering "<em>Amen</em>,<em> yehei Shemei rabba"</em>" out loud, harsh decrees are
    erased. Similarly, it is customary to recite the first verse of <em>Shema</em> out loud, in order to arouse<em> kavanah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    61:4).
</p>
<p>
We say the rest of the prayers, such as <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, the recital of<em> Shema</em>, <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, and the remaining    <em>mizmorim</em> (songs), in a regular voice, or at least in a volume that we are able to hear. However, even if a person only mouthed the words, and he
    did not hear what he was saying, he still fulfilled his obligation.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Amidah</em> prayer, which is private and intense, is recited silently. According to most <em>poskim</em>, even the silent <em>Amidah</em>,    <em>l'chatchilah</em>, must be heard by one's ears, but one must be careful that the person praying next to him does not hear him (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    101:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 5-6). However, the custom of most Kabbalists is that <em>l'chatchilah</em>, a silent prayer must be recited only by
    mouthing the words and not by hearing them even with one's own ears (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 101:8).
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to learn from this law a general concept: that thought alone is not sufficient, that good<em> </em>intention without action is not enough.
    For the soul, deep within the heart, is pure, and the challenge is to project its goodness outwards in order to mend the world. Therefore, it is necessary
    to say the prayers out loud, or at least to mouth the words (<em>Maharal</em>,<em> Netiv HaAvodah</em>,<em> </em>chapter 2).

    <strong> The Language of Prayer</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    The<em> </em>mitzvah of prayer is ideally performed in Hebrew, for that is the language in which <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah </em>composed the wording of
    prayer, and it is the Holy Tongue which was used to create the world. However, <em>b'dieved</em>, a person who does not understand Hebrew may fulfill his
    obligation in other languages (<em>Sotah</em> 32a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 62:2).<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    There is a fundamental difference between the person who prays in Hebrew and the person who prays in another language. The one who prays in a different
    language does not fulfill his obligation without understanding the meaning of the words he is reciting. However, one who prays in Hebrew fulfills his
    obligation even if he does not understand the meaning of the words. Still, even one who prays in Hebrew is obligated to understand the meaning of the first
    verse of <em>Shema</em> and the first blessing of the <em>Amidah</em>, because not having<em> kavanah</em> for those parts of prayer prevents him from
    fulfilling his obligation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 101:14, 124:2; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 62:2).
</p>
<p>
    In contrast to other languages, Hebrew has intrinsic value, since the Torah was given to us in Hebrew and it was used to create the world. Even a person
    who does not understand Hebrew can fulfill the mitzvah by praying in the Holy Tongue because of its inherent significance. However, the value of every
    other language derives from the fact that it expresses the person's thoughts and feelings. Hence, a person who does not understand the language that he is
    saying renders the words useless, and therefore cannot use it to recite <em>Shema</em> and the rest of the prayers.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, a person who does not understand Hebrew is permitted to choose the language in which he wants to pray. Although the advantage of praying in a
    language that he understands is that he can concentrate on the words, on the other hand, one who prays in Hebrew has the benefit of praying in the Holy
    Tongue, for every Hebrew letter is directed towards the rectification of all the spiritual worlds (see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 101:4; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
    16).
</p>
<p>
    Permission to pray in any language is granted as a temporary concession<em> </em>(<em>k'hora'at sha'ah</em>), specifically for people who do not understand
    Hebrew. However, it is prohibited to establish a <em>minyan</em> that will regularly pray in a different language. This was one of the sins of the Reform
    Movement which translated the prayers to German and established prayer services in a foreign tongue, causing generations after them to forget the Holy
    Tongue, thereby giving way to the abandonment of Judaism and assimilation (<em>Chatam Sofer</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, 84 and 86; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    101:13; see further in this book 17:8).
</p>
<p>
    The mitzvah of reciting <em>Shema</em>, in principle, may also be fulfilled with a translation. However, some doubt was raised regarding the accuracy of
    the translation of a number of words. Therefore, today, in the opinion of some eminent <em>Acharonim </em>(later Torah authorities), one cannot fulfill his
    obligation of reciting <em>Shema</em> by saying a translation of the words (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 62:3; further in this book 15:9).

In <em>Megillah</em> 17b, it is told that Shimon Hapakuli arranged the eighteen <em>berachot</em> before Rabban Gamliel in the proper order, and a            <em>beraita</em> is brought which clarifies the order of the <em>berachot</em> according to scriptural verses. A question is raised there, 18a:
            After <em>Anshei</em> <em>Knesset</em> <em>HaGedolah</em> instituted them, what was left for Shimon Hapakuli to arrange? The Gemara answers that
            they were forgotten and Shimon Hapakuli went back and rearranged them. One may ask, how can it be that the wording of the prayer that they were
            obligated to recite every day had been forgotten? The <em>Shitah</em> <em>Mekubetzet</em> resolves this question in <em>Berachot</em> 28b saying
            that they merely forgot the order of the <em>berachot</em>, which is what Shimon Hapakuli then restored. In the <em>Rach</em>'s and <em>Me'iri</em>
            's version there is no mention in the <em>Gemara</em> that Shimon Hapakuli arranged anything in the <em>Shemoneh</em> <em>Esrei</em>, and hence
            there is no question or answer about that.
        </p>
        <p>
            See further in this book 18:10, concerning the addition of the<em> </em>"<em>LaMalshinim</em>" <em>berachah.</em> Likewise, see further in this
book chapter 2, note 1, in the words of the <em>Mabit</em>, the reason for the institution of the <em>minyan</em> by <em>Anshei</em>            <em>Knesset</em> <em>HaGedolah</em> is that it replaced the <em>Shechinah</em> which was revealed through the sacrifices.

            The <em>poskim</em> are divided regarding whether or not the <em>Rambam</em> and the <em>Smag</em> hold that <em>hirhur k'dibur </em>(thought is
like speech) also concerning the recital of <em>Shema</em> or just regarding other <em>mitzvot</em>. (See <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 62:4,            <em>s.v. </em>"<em>Yatza</em>.")
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 62:4 states, "If, because of sickness or circumstances beyond his control, a person thought the <em>Shema</em> in his
            heart, he has fulfilled his obligation." The <em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to what he means. According to the <em>Pri</em> <em>Chadash</em> and
many other <em>poskim</em>, one who merely thinks the words does not truly fulfill his obligation, and this is what is written in <em>Bei'ur</em><em>Halachah</em>, <em>s.v.</em> "<em>Yatza</em>." Therefore, if the circumstances beyond his control have passed and the time to recite<em>Shema</em> has not yet passed, he must go back and verbally recite the <em>Shema</em>. However, the <em>Birkei Yosef</em> and the            <em>Pri Megadim</em> are of the opinion that one who finds himself in circumstances beyond his control (<em>annus</em>) does fulfill his obligation
by just thinking the words of <em>Shema</em>, and, even if the circumstances pass, he is not required to repeat them (the <em>Hashlamah</em> and            <em>Michtam</em> hold this way as well). The <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 5, 4, explains that the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> means
            to say that we rely on the minority opinion which states that <em>hirhur </em>is<em> k'dibur</em>, only in extenuating circumstances, but if the
person is no longer in circumstances beyond his control, the situation is no longer extenuating and one must repeat the <em>Shema</em> (            <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 4, 3:19 agrees).
        </p>
        <p>
            Concerning the recital of <em>Shema</em>, which is a biblical commandment, one who mistakenly thought the words in his heart, is most certainly
            required to go back and verbally recite them. Regarding blessings, the <em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah</em> writes that those who rely on the majority
of the <em>Rishonim</em> and repeat them do not lose out. The <em>Yalkut</em> <em>Yosef</em>, part 3, 106:11, writes,<em>safek berachot l'hakel</em> (if there is doubt regarding the recital of blessings, we are lenient) and if, for example, he thought            <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>,<em> </em>but did not say them, he need not go back and repeat them. However, regarding the blessing upon food, if he
            recited the words in his thoughts, he should think the words "<em>Baruch Shem kevod malchuto l'olam va'ed</em>" ("Blessed is the Name of His
            glorious kingdom for all eternity,") and then go back and say the <em>berachah</em> verbally.

            <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
            Regarding the recital of <em>Shema</em>, there is disagreement. According to Rebbi, <em>Shema</em> may only be said in the Holy Tongue, whereas,
according to the <em>Chachamim</em>, it may be recited in any language (<em>Berachot</em> 13a). Because in <em>Sotah</em> 32b there is a<em>stam mishnah</em> (a <em>mishnah</em> that does not specify who said it) in which it is written that the halachah is like the<em>Chachamim</em> who maintain that the recital of <em>Shema</em>, <em>Birkat</em> <em>HaMazon</em>, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, and other            <em>berachot</em> may be said in any language, also here, the halachah is according to the <em>Chachamim</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding prayer, it is the opinion of the <em>Rif</em> that only a person who prays in a <em>minyan</em> may pray in a different language, since
            the <em>Shechinah</em> (Divine Presence) dwells there and his prayer will be accepted. However, a person who is praying individually must
specifically pray in the Holy Tongue, for his prayer will not be accepted in another language. Nevertheless, most <em>poskim</em> agree with the            <em>Rosh</em> who is of the opinion that even while praying individually, one may also pray in a different language, with the exception of Aramaic,
            and that is the ruling in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 101:4, in the concluding statement, "<em>Yesh omrim</em>."
