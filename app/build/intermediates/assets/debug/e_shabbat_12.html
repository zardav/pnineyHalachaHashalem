        1. <em>Toĥen</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Many items naturally exist as organic wholes, but people have learned
        to break them down and grind them in order to create new and wonderful
        things. By grinding wheat and other grains, we make flour, which in
        turn can be used to bake bread, cake, pasta, and the like. Cayenne
        pepper is made by grinding hot peppers, and coffee is made by grinding
        coffee beans. By grinding certain healing plants, medicines are made;
        by grinding other plants, dyes are prepared. Since grinding is a
        creative activity, it is included in the <em>melakhot</em> prohibited
        on Shabbat. Grinding metal and crumbling a block of dirt or clay are
        forbidden as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, grinding an object turns it into flour or powder, but the
        prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> can also apply to breaking something down
        into small pieces. For example, one who chops trees into small bits of
        wood so that they will easily catch fire transgresses the prohibition
        of <em>Toĥen</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 74b).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one wishes to grind hot peppers or the like to prepare food on
        Shabbat, he may do so as long as he incorporates two <em>shinuyim</em>
        (changes) into the process. Traditionally, grinding required two
        utensils: the mortar upon which the material to be ground was placed,
        and the pestle that was used to crush and grind this material. Grinding
        with these two utensils is prohibited by Torah law. Grinding using one
        of them is rabbinically prohibited. For Shabbat use, however, one may
        grind food as long as two <em>shinuyim</em> are made. For example, the
        handle of a knife can be used instead of a pestle, and a plate can be
        used instead of a mortar (SA 321:7). Although the Sages generally
        forbid food preparation involving <em>melakha</em> even when it is
        performed with two <em>shinuyim</em>, here they permit it since the
action is considered <em>derekh akhila </em>rather than        <em>derekh melakha</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> applies to natural items like plants,
        fruits, and metals, but does not apply to foods that have already been
        ground and then recombined. Therefore, bread, matza, cookies,
        chocolate, or hardened sugar may be made into crumbs (Rema 321:12).
        Similarly, one may crumble tobacco powder that has hardened.
        Furthermore, a sick person who has difficulty swallowing pills may
        crush them, since their components were already ground before they were
        made into a pill. In such a case there is no problem of <em>Toĥen</em>
        (SSK 33:4). Some maintain that one may crush the pills only for
        immediate use, and <em>le-khatĥila</em> this opinion should be followed
        (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 17:4). In any case, even when one may grind or
        crush something, one may not use utensils explicitly designed for these
        purposes, like a grater.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who scrapes off clay or mud that has hardened naturally from a
        surface and crumbles the dirt in order to use it transgresses a Torah
        prohibition. If he does not need the dirt, he is transgressing
        rabbinically. Therefore, if mud or clay has dried on clothes or shoes,
        it may not be removed if doing so will definitely make it crumble. Only
        if it is uncertain whether the mud will crumble may it be removed. Even
        if it is clear that it will crumble, if necessary it may be removed
        with a <em>shinui</em>. For example, one may remove the mud on his
        clothing by using the back of his hand, or he may use one shoe to rub
        the mud off of the other one.

        2. Chopping Vegetables and Mashing Bananas and Avocados
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Rishonim disagree whether the prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> applies
        to chopping vegetables finely for salad. Some maintain that since
        cutting the vegetables into small pieces serves a purpose, the
        prohibition applies. However, according to the majority of Rishonim,
        this is prohibited only if the vegetables are otherwise inedible, such
as when one chops vegetables in order to cook them. In contrast,        <strong> </strong>if the vegetables are edible raw, there is no problem
        with chopping them. In practice, since this disagreement concerns a
        Torah law, one should defer to the stringent opinion. Thus one may not
        cut vegetables finely for a salad (SA 321:12).<strong> </strong>
        However, if the salad is being prepared right before the meal, even the
stringent opinion permits it. In this case, the cutting is not        <em>derekh melakha</em> but <em>derekh akhila</em>, as one may eat
finely-cut food on Shabbat (Rashba; <em>Beit Yosef</em>; Rema 321:12).        <em>Le-khatĥila</em> it is preferable, even when preparing salad for
the upcoming meal, not to cut the pieces especially finely (        <em>Beit Yosef</em>; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 45).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

    <p>
        May one mash foods like bananas and avocados? Some are stringent and
        forbid doing so with a fork, including for immediate consumption. Even
        the stringent opinion permits mashing these foods with a spoon, because
        that is considered a <em>shinui</em>. However, the lenient position
        allows mashing bananas and avocados even with a fork for immediate
        consumption, and the <em>halakha</em> follows this position. Thus one
        may mash a banana or avocado with a fork for immediate consumption. As
        we have already seen, the prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> is not relevant
        to food being prepared for immediate consumption, as long as the
        mashing is not done with a special utensil designed for this purpose.

    <p>
        One may use a meat knife to cut a roast into slices, even for later
        consumption. A knife may be used to slice hard cheese as well.
        Similarly, one may mash hard-boiled eggs with a fork. Even when it is
        permissible to cut something or crumble it, one may not do so with a
        utensil that is designed for this purpose, like a grater (SA 321:9-10).
        However, one may use a utensil that is designed for cutting things into
        large pieces. Therefore, one may use a cheese knife or an egg slicer,
        since its blades are far apart from one another. Similarly, one may
        slice a loaf of bread as well (SSK 6:3).

        3. Lash
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Lash</em> refers to the act of kneading,
        forming dough out of flour and water. However, it also includes mixing
        any liquid with flour to form dough. Even if the liquid used is
        viscous, like honey or mayonnaise, it is still forbidden to mix it with
        flour. As long as one binds the flour and forms dough, this is
        considered <em>Lash</em>. Along the same lines, if one mixes water with
        dried earth in order to make bricks or spackle to plug holes in a wall,
        he transgresses <em>Lash</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not perform even a single component of the kneading process.
        Therefore, one may not pour water onto flour. Additionally, after dough
        has been formed, one may not shape it.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Lash</em>
        involves forming something new with characteristics that differ from
        those of its component parts. Flour on its own and water on its own
        cannot rise and cannot be baked. Only after they are mixed together can
        they be made into bread and cookies. Similarly, dried earth or spackle
        on their own and water on its own cannot be used for building. Only
        after they are mixed together can they be used to form bricks or to
        plug holes in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition on <em>Lash </em>is limited to a thick mixture.
        Rabbinically, it is also prohibited to make a loose mixture (as will be
        explained in the next section). However, if the quantity of the solid
        added to the liquid is so minimal that it dissolves, the liquid retains
        its form, and no type of mixture results, then there is no prohibition
        of <em>Lash</em>. Therefore, one may add coffee or sugar to water, as
        the granules do not form a mass in the water. In addition, one may
        prepare infant formula by mixing the powder with water since the
        mixture does not form a mass; rather, the liquid retains its form, and
        can be drunk from a bottle. Thus there is no problem of <em>Lash</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
        (One should prepare coffee in a <em>kli shlishi</em> to avoid violating
        the <em>melakha </em>of <em>Bishul</em>; see above, 10:7.)
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Preparing a Loose Mixture with a <em>Shinui</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, the Torah prohibition of <em>Lash</em> applies to
        forming a thick mixture. This means that many discrete particles become
        one solid mass that will not flow or spread out if left on a plate or
        bowl. In contrast, it is not forbidden by Torah law to form a loose
        mixture that can be poured from utensil to utensil and that spreads
        outward if left on a plate or bowl. This is because making such a
        mixture does not involve kneading, but only stirring. However, since
        one might mistakenly assume that if one may make a loose batter he may
        also make a thick dough, the Sages created a fence around the Torah and
forbade forming a loose mixture. But one may make such a mixture with a        <em>shinui</em> that serves as a reminder that there is a prohibition
        involved, ensuring that no one will end up making a thick mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>shinui</em> may be in the order the ingredients are added to
        the mixing bowl. If normally the dry ingredients are added first,
        followed by the wet ingredients, the wet ingredients should be added
        first, followed by the dry ingredients. If normally the wet ingredients
        would be added first followed by the dry ingredients, that order should
        be reversed. When following this procedure, one must make sure to add
        the liquid all at once so that a thick mixture will not be formed in
        the process of making a loose one.
    </p>
    <p>
Some maintain that it is unnecessary to incorporate an additional        <em>shinui</em> during the stirring stage, as long as the mixture is
        not stirred as vigorously as one does during the week. Others are more
        stringent and require a <em>shinui</em> during the stirring as well.
        For example, instead of stirring the batter using a circular motion,
        one may stir in straight lines, from side to side, or perpendicularly.
        Alternatively, one might mix the batter with one’s finger, by shaking
the bowl, or by pouring the batter from bowl to bowl.<em>Le-khatĥila</em> it is proper to comply with all the        <em>poskim</em> and change both the order the ingredients are added and
        the way the batter is stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the ingredients are not usually added in any particular order, the
        dry ingredients should be added first, followed by the wet ingredients.
        Additionally, the way the mixing is done should be changed.
        <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may add liquid to a thick mixture to make it thinner, since this is
        the opposite of kneading. Kneading leads to discrete units coalescing,
        while adding water weakens the cohesiveness of the component parts (BHL
        321:15, s.v. "yakhol").
    </p>
    <p>
        According to this, water may be added to raw tahini, since that makes
        it more liquid. However, some prohibit doing so, since during the
        process there is a stage in which the mixture becomes a bit harder (SSK
        8:31). Nevertheless, <em>halakha</em> in practice follows those who are
        lenient, since the eventual result is a loose mixture. Additionally,
        since the sesame seeds in the tahini were ground and mixed before
        Shabbat, according to many the prohibition of <em>Lash</em> no longer
        applies (SA 321:15). In order to avoid any doubt, it is proper to mix
        with a <em>shinui</em>.
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Preparing a Thick Mixture with a <em>Shinui</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether one may make a thick mixture on
        Shabbat using a <em>shinui</em> when the food is intended to be eaten
        on Shabbat. Some forbid this, arguing that the Sages permitted kneading
        with a <em>shinui</em> only in the case of a loose mixture, where the
        prohibition is only rabbinic. In contrast, a thick mixture may not be
        made even using a <em>shinui</em>, as it involves a Torah prohibition
        (Rambam). Others maintain that in order to make food for Shabbat, even
        thick mixtures may be made with a <em>shinui</em> (<em>Tosafot</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, at a time of need, when it is a case of great necessity,
        one may rely on those who are lenient and prepare a thick mixture using
        a <em>shinui</em>. For example, when the only readily available baby
        food was a thick porridge prepared by adding water or milk to a dry mix
        of oatmeal or other grain, it was permitted to prepare this porridge
        with a <em>shinui</em>. Similarly, in times when there was no food
        available for animals other than a thick mixture of bran and water, it
        was permitted to make such a mixture with a <em>shinui</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>shinui</em> is relevant both to the order in which the
        ingredients are added and to the manner of stirring. If there is a set
        order for the ingredients, it should be reversed. If there is no set
        order, the dry ingredients should be added first, followed by the wet
        ingredients. As for the manner of stirring, the spoon may be moved back
        and forth in a straight line or perpendicularly rather than with a
        circular motion. If this is not recognizable as a <em>shinui</em>, the
        spoon should be completely removed from the mixture after each stirring
        motion.
        <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in practice, it is very rare for a leniency to be necessary
        here, since as a general rule there is no pressing need to prepare a
        thick mixture on Shabbat. Nevertheless, the lenient opinion is very
        important, because there are cases in which it is unclear whether a
        specific type of mixture would be prohibited because of <em>Lash</em>.
In such cases, one can follow the lenient opinion and knead with a        <em>shinui</em>. It is preferable to do so for fairly immediate
        consumption (when Rashba is lenient).
    </p>
    <p>
        In cases where practically all <em>poskim</em> agree that <em>Lash</em>
        applies to a particular type of mixture, one may not form it even with
        a <em>shinui</em>. For example, one may not mix sesame seeds or nuts
        with honey. Similarly, one may not mix butter, cocoa, and sugar
        together, since they form a thick mixture. Such mixtures are prohibited
        even if done with a <em>shinui</em> and for immediate consumption.

        6. Foods that Are Not Subject to <em>Lash</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is no prohibition of <em>Lash</em> for food that has been mashed.
Since it has already been mashed and softened, the act of kneading        <em> </em>does not fundamentally change it. Therefore, one may mix a
        dish of meat, potatoes, and barley that have fallen apart, and one may
        even add water to the mixture to form one mass. One may also add gravy
        to mashed potatoes and mix them together. Since the potatoes are
already mashed, there is no prohibition of <em>Lash</em> (        <em>Responsa Rambam</em> as quoted in <em>Beit Yosef</em> 321:19).
        <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a mixture was made before Shabbat but some liquid gradually
        separated from it, it may be mixed again on Shabbat since there is no
        prohibition of <em>Lash</em> for something that has already been mixed.
        Since all permit this, it is unnecessary to use a <em>shinui</em>, but
        one should still stir more slowly than on a weekday. For example, if
        oil has risen to the top of an eggplant salad, it may be mixed back in
        with the eggplant. Similarly, if peanut butter separated and there is
        oil floating on top, it may be mixed back in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many <em>poskim</em> seemingly allow adding ingredients to a mixture
        that had been prepared before Shabbat. However, some are stringent.
        Therefore, the ingredients may be added with a <em>shinui</em>. For
example, hot sauce may be added to hummus as long as it is mixed with a        <em>shinui</em>. Similarly, if an eggplant spread was prepared before
        Shabbat and mashed in its juice, mayonnaise may be added to it on
        Shabbat with a <em>shinui</em> (see SA 321:15-16). We have already seen
        (in the previous section) that the <em>shinui</em> can involve moving
        the spoon back and forth in straight lines or perpendicularly when
        stirring. If this is not a recognizable change, the spoon should be
        removed from the mixture entirely after the completion of each stirring
        motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may mix cake crumbs with soft cheese or milk, since the crumbs were
        already kneaded when they were made into cake, and thus the prohibition
        of <em>Lash</em> no longer applies. However, some are stringent and
        maintain that once the baked item has been crumbled, the original act
        of kneading has been nullified. Therefore, one should mix the crumbs
        with a <em>shinui</em>, and do so only for immediate consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important principle is that <em>Lash</em> involves taking dry,
        discrete materials and binding them together. However, if the dry
        ingredients spread throughout the liquid to which they are added, this
        is not considered <em>Lash</em>. Therefore, one may add herbs to soft
        cheese, since the herbal leaves spread out and do not clump together.
        Similarly, one may mix granola into soft cheese, since the granola bits
        do not join together and become one mass, but rather adhere to the
        cheese. One may also mix strawberries or bananas with cream, since the
        pieces do not bind and become one. One may add sugar or cocoa to soft
        cheese, because the aim is not to bind the granules of sugar with the
        cocoa but rather to flavor the cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Aĥaronim debate whether one may mix two viscous foods like soft
        cheese and honey. Some maintain that since they form a new thick
        mixture, it is considered <em>Lash</em> (SSK 8:16). Others maintain
        that the prohibition of <em>Lash</em> exists only when mixing dry
        ingredients with wet ones, while one may mix two wet ingredients
        together (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> </em>OĤ 4:74). In practice, one may
        mix the two foods with a <em>shinui</em>.
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Assorted Laws
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not make pudding if the mixture is thick enough that it cannot
        be poured. However, pudding that is loose and pourable may be made
        using a <em>shinui</em>. As we saw above in section 4, one should begin
        with the dry ingredients and then add the wet ones, and one should mix
        with a <em>shinui</em> (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:74, <em>Lash</em>
        §7). Let us reiterate that this <em>shinui</em> may be stirring with a
        back-and-forth or perpendicular motion instead of the normal circular
        motion. If this is not recognizable as a <em>shinui</em>, the spoon
        should be removed from the mixture after completing each stirring
        motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not prepare a gelatin dessert by mixing powder and water
        together. Although the mixture starts out loose, ultimately it hardens.
Thus one who mixes water with gelatin powder is transgressing the        <em>melakha</em> of <em>Lash</em> (see n. 6 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not prepare instant mashed potatoes, since adding water to
        reconstitute the mashed potatoes forms a thick mixture. However, one
may prepare instant couscous by pouring water onto it from a        <em>kli sheni </em>and stirring it with a <em>shinui</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Everybody agrees that vegetables that are not cut finely may be mixed
        with oil or mayonnaise. Since the pieces are not tiny, they do not form
        a mixture. However, if the pieces are finely cut, the <em>poskim</em>
        disagree whether one may mix them with mayonnaise. Some maintain that
        one may do so as long as the vegetables do not form a solid mass
        (Maharshal). Others maintain that if they adhere to each other, even if
        they do not form a solid mass, it is prohibited (<em>Taz</em>). One who
wishes may be lenient, but he should mix the vegetables with a        <em>shinui</em>, and prepare the salad shortly before the meal (MB
        321:68; see section 5, nn. 8-9).
    </p>
    <p>
        Preparing egg salad is also subject to dispute. On the one hand, there
        are reasons to be lenient: All the ingredients (eggs, onion, and
        mayonnaise) are already edible, and it does not become a homogeneous
        mixture like dough. On the other hand, it does generally form a thick
        mixture. In practice, one may prepare egg salad. The eggs may be mashed
        with a fork, as long as the mixing is done with a <em>shinui</em> and
        the preparation is done for fairly immediate consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same procedure should be followed when making tuna salad with eggs
        and mayonnaise and when making chopped liver with eggs. Although the
mixture they form is homogeneous, one may mix them with a        <em>shinui</em> for fairly immediate consumption.

        8. Squeezing Fruits
    </h2>
    <p>
        Juicing - that is, squeezing fruits in order to release their juice -
is a violation of the prohibition of <em>Mefarek</em>, a<em>tolada</em> of the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Dash</em>. While<em>Dash</em> involves separating wheat kernels from their husks,        <em>Mefarek</em> involves separating juice from its fruit. It is
        prohibited by Torah law to squeeze olives to produce oil or to squeeze
        grapes to produce wine. Wine and oil are important liquids, and the
        majority of olives and grapes are grown in order to produce these
        liquids. In contrast, the prohibition of juicing other fruits, which
        are not grown primarily for their juice, is rabbinic.
        <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not juice a fruit for the purpose of extracting its juice in
        order to drink it. However, if the purpose is to add flavor to food,
        one may juice fruit directly into food, since in such a case the
        squeezing is never viewed as producing a discrete quantity of liquid.
        The juice that is considered part of one food is simply transferred to
        another food. Therefore, one may squeeze grapes into food, a lemon into
        a vegetable salad, or an orange into grated carrots. Similarly, a lemon
        may be squeezed onto fried fish, even though the juice is not absorbed
        by the fish. Since it is meant to flavor the fish, it is secondary to
        it and considered a part of it (SA 320:4; SSK ch. 5 n. 15).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one wishes to squeeze a lemon in order to make lemonade, he should
        not squeeze it into an empty pitcher or into water. Rather, he should
        squeeze the lemon into the sugar in such a way that all the juice is
        absorbed by the sugar. This way, he is transferring the juice from one
        food to another, which is permitted.
        <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may squeeze out excess oil from fried foods, or excess liquid from
        pickled foods, in order to improve their taste. Similarly, these excess
        liquids may be squeezed into other food. However, if one wants the
        liquid that is being extracted, then squeezing these foods is
        prohibited (SA 320:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may cut a grapefruit and eat it with a spoon, even though in the
        process juice will flow from it. Since most of the liquid remains in
        the grapefruit, it is not prohibited. One may also cut up fruit for
        fruit salad, even though cutting the fruit will cause a bit of juice to
        flow out. This is not prohibited because one does not intend to
        separate the juice from the fruit, and most of the juice remains inside
        the fruit. If there is some juice remaining when one has finished
        eating the fruit salad or grapefruit, one may drink the juice.

        9. Pickling and Salting Foods
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade pickling cucumbers (or olives and the like) in brine
        or vinegar, because pickling is comparable to cooking. Similarly, the
        Sages forbade salting foods if doing so fundamentally changes them, as
        is the case with radishes, onions, garlic, turnips, and cucumbers. Salt
        helps sweat these vegetables, extracting their bitterness, changing
        their textures, and improving their taste. Thus, salting is comparable
        to the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Me’abed</em> (below 18:6), and its
impact on foods is similar to that of cooking (SA 321:2-6; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 15).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may salt an individual piece of a vegetable and then eat it,
        because this does not resemble pickling. Many also permit salting
        multiple pieces at once, as long as the pieces will be eaten soon (SA
        321:4). However, the custom is to be stringent and eat each piece
        immediately after salting it. This is because if one waits to eat a
        salted piece until after additional pieces have been salted, it may
look like he is pickling food (MB 321:20; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>        <em>ad loc</em>. 26).
    </p>
    <p>
        Salting multiple pieces together is permissible if one adds oil as
        well. This is because the oil reduces the saltiness, making it clear
        that one is not pickling, but rather flavoring his food (MB 321:14).
        Similarly, one may add salt to a cucumber and radish salad being
        prepared for the upcoming meal. This is because preparing the salad
        also involves adding oil and spices that weaken the salt, making it
        clear that one is not pickling (<em>Taz</em> 321:1; MB <em>ad loc</em>.
        14). One may also add as much salt as one wishes to vegetables that are
        not normally pickled, such as tomatoes (SSK 11:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages also prohibited things that resemble pickling. Therefore, one
        may not prepare large quantities of salt water or other pickling agents
        on Shabbat. However, one may prepare a limited quantity of such
        mixtures - enough for dipping foods during the meal. Concentrated salt
        water (i.e., a mixture that is at least two-thirds salt) may not be
        prepared even in small quantities, since it resembles preparing brine
        to pickle fish (SA 321:2).
    </p>
    <a name="10"></a><h2>
        10. Coloring Food
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is an accepted principle<em> </em>that the prohibition of dyeing
        does not pertain to food. Therefore, one may add turmeric to a dish,
        even though it will color the food yellow. Similarly, one may dip bread
        in wine even though it will turn the bread red (SA 320:19). This is
        because the Torah prohibition is limited to long-lasting dyeing (like
        that of clothing or walls). Rabbinically, short-term coloring is
        prohibited as well. However, the short-term coloring of food is not
        included in this prohibition. This is because the primary concern with
        food is its taste, not its color; furthermore, people do not normally
        color most foods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are stringent and avoid coloring drinks, as the change made to
        them is more obvious. Additionally, it is somewhat more common to color
        liquids than solids, since liquids are sometimes used for dyeing
        clothing and walls. Therefore, even though drinks are made for
        drinking, and not for their appearance, it is rabbinically forbidden to
        color them (<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Pekudei 3-4). However,
        according to most <em>poskim</em> there is no prohibition of coloring
even drinks. This is the <em>halakha </em>in practice (<em>Darkhei Moshe</em> 320:2). However, if possible,        <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is preferable to defer to those who prohibit
        coloring drinks. Therefore, when mixing red and white wines, it is
        preferable not to pour the red into the white, as this will color the
        drink. Rather, one should pour the white wine into the red, because
        then the change in color is not obvious when the white wine becomes
        part of the red. Similarly, when preparing juice from concentrate, it
        is preferable to put the concentrate into the cup or pitcher first, and
        then add the water. This way the water is immediately blended with the
        concentrate, and the coloring is not obvious. Similarly, when preparing
        tea using liquid essence, it is preferable to put the essence in first
        and add the water to it (SHT 318:64-65; see above 10:8, which explains
        that one should pour the water from a <em>kli sheni</em>).

    <a name="11"></a><h2>
        11. Writing, Building, and Spreading
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not write letters or draw pictures on a cake using candies or
        frosting. Though this is not prohibited by Torah law since the letters
        are not long lasting, it is rabbinically prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a cake has letters or pictures on it, one may not cut through the
        letters, but only between them. If the letters are formed in the cake
        or cookie itself, as is typically found on tea biscuits, they may be
        cut, as these letters are insignificant (below 18:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is necessary to open a package of food that has writing on it,
        one should try to do so without tearing the letters. However, if there
        is no way around this, he may open the bag even if he will tear letters
        (as explained below in 18:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not churn milk into butter on Shabbat. Many believe this is
prohibited by Torah law as a <em>tolada</em> of <em>Boneh</em>,        <em> </em>because it involves changing the food from a liquid to a
        solid (<em>Shabbat</em> 95a; MT 10:13). One also may not shape food
into impressive designs, as this is a type of building (MA 340:17;        <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 39:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may spread food on bread or crackers, as the prohibition of
        spreading (<em>Memare’aĥ</em>) does not apply to foods. One also may
        change the appearance of the spread to make it look more appealing,
        smoothing it as desired. Thus, one may put hummus on a serving plate
        and spread it into a circle for aesthetic reasons since the food is
        already ready to eat, and smoothing it does not improve it in any way.
        Some are stringent and do not permit smoothing foods to make them look
        more appealing. One who chooses to be stringent should be commended
        (Rema 321:19).
    </p>
    <a name="12"></a><h2>
        12. Ice and Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade crushing snow, hail, or ice in order to turn them
        into water, because this resembles a <em>melakha</em> (see the next
        paragraph). However, one may add ice cubes to water even though they
        will melt. Since he is not actively melting the ice, it is not
        prohibited (<em>Shabbat</em> 51b). One may chip away at a chunk of ice
        in order to put some into a cup or container, even though bits of ice
        may melt during the process, as it is not his purpose to turn the ice
        into water. Similarly, one may walk on snow even though as one walks a
        little snow will melt, because this is not his intention (SA 320:9-12).
    </p>
    <p>
        A few <em>poskim</em> (<em>Sefer</em> <em>Ha-Teruma</em> and Rosh)
        maintain that one may not crush ice and turn it into water because
        turning a solid into a liquid is considered producing something new.
        According to this, heating congealed gravy or the like is also
        prohibited, since heating the gravy will liquefy it. However, according
        to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, the prohibition of crushing snow is
        not because something new is being formed, but because crushing snow is
        similar to squeezing fruit in that both actions are done with one’s
        hands. According to them, one may liquefy congealed gravy indirectly by
        warming it (Rambam, Ramban, Rashba, <em>Smag</em>, <em>Smak</em>). The
        Sephardic custom is to be lenient in this regard. The Ashkenazic custom
        is to be stringent <em>le-khatĥila</em> and refrain from liquefying
        congealed food by heating it. When necessary, even Ashkenazim may be
        lenient (SA 318:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the law for making ice as well; Sephardic tradition allows it,
        while some Ashkenazim are stringent <em>le-khatĥila</em>. However, when
        necessary, such as on a hot day, even Ashkenazim may make ice (SSK
10:4). Some Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em> are lenient even        <em>le-khatĥila</em> and allow making ice even if it is not a hot day.
        This is because ice does not have a sustained existence as a solid. It
        starts melting immediately upon being removed from the freezer, so
        making ice is not really creating anything new (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
        6:34; 8:12).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may add spices to foods even though they create a new smell in the
        foods. Although one may not cause clothing to smell nice by creating a
new smell, there is no comparable prohibition for foods (SA 511:4; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 24).
    </p>
    <p>
        According to many <em>poskim</em>, one may not whip an egg or make
        whipped cream, because it looks like one is preparing them for cooking
        (<em>Shabbat</em> 109a following Rashi; MB 321:68). Others are lenient
        (see <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §66).

            <em>Kol Bo</em>
            maintains that removing mud from clothes by scraping it off is not
            prohibited since one has no interest in causing the mud to crumble.
            Besides, mud is considered already ground (and not an organic
            whole). However, Rabbeinu Peretz forbids this. SA 302:7 cites him
            as "<em>yesh omrim</em>" (there are those who maintain). Although
            some are lenient in practice (Ĥida; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 302:17,
            321:22), most Aĥaronim defer to Rabbeinu Peretz’s opinion (SAH
302:17; <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 36;<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Mishpatim 6; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>            <em>ad loc</em>. 49). In any case, when it is uncertain that the
            mud will in fact crumble, even those who prohibit would agree that
            it is a <em>davar she-eino mitkaven</em> and is therefore permitted
            (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in SSK ch. 15 n. 103). It would seem
            that when dealing with mud and clay, as long as it will not
            crumble, removing it is not considered <em>Toĥen</em>. If it is
            clear that it will crumble but there is a great need to remove it,
            even those who forbid doing so would permit removing it if it is
done with a <em>shinui</em>, because then the action becomes a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em> (see BHL 302:6 s.v. "o").

            There are three opinions as to what constitutes <em>Toĥen</em>:
        </p>
        <p>
            a) According to Rabbeinu Ĥananel and Rosh, <em>Toĥen</em> is
            relevant only to making flour.
        </p>
        <p>
            b) According to most Rishonim, if cutting something into pieces
            makes it edible, one may not do so; but if it is edible as is, one
            may cut it. This is the position of Rid, Ritva, Ra’ah, and Ramban,
            and it is similar to Rambam’s position as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            c) Any time one cuts vegetables into small pieces, it is included
in the prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em>. This is the opinion of Rashi,            <em>Or Zaru’a</em>, and <em>Yere’im</em>. SA<em> </em>321:12 defers
            to the opinion of those who are stringent. However, he adds, based
            on Rashba, that if the food is intended to be eaten immediately,
            one may cut it. Although almost all <em>poskim</em> agree that one
may do so for immediate use, some cast doubt upon this leniency (<em>Shiltei Giborim</em>). Therefore, Aĥaronim write that            <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is preferable not to cut salad especially
            finely (<em>Beit Yosef</em>; MB 321:45).
        </p>

            </a>
            There are several reasons for this permission:
        </p>
        <p>
a) According to most <em>poskim</em>, the prohibition of            <em>Toĥen</em> does not apply to fruits or vegetables that are
            edible (as we saw in the previous note).
        </p>
        <p>
            b) Even though SA 321:12 rules in accordance with those who are
            stringent, nevertheless, when the food is being prepared for
immediate consumption, there is no prohibition (Rashba;            <em>Beit Yosef</em>; Rema).
        </p>
        <p>
            c) Even if the prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> were applicable,
            according to <em>Igrot Moshe</em> 4:74, <em>Toĥen</em> §2, since
these foods remain a solid mass even after being mashed,            <em>Toĥen</em> does not apply here at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            d) Mashing with a fork already constitutes a <em>shinui</em>, as
this is not the normal way to grind (<em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 1:28).            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 5:27 and <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:8:12
            permit this in practice. However, <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> OĤ §57 is
            stringent, and does not allow it even when the food being prepared
            will be consumed immediately. He also maintains that mashing is
            considered a type of <em>Toĥen</em> since it breaks down the
            structure of the fruit. He adds that if the mashing is done to feed
            the food to a baby, then it is prohibited based on MA 321:14,
because it renders the food edible. SSK 6:1 and            <em>Hilkhot Shabbat</em> <em>Be-Shabbat</em> 1:12:15 also state
            that one should be stringent. But they allow mashing with a spoon,
            as this definitely constitutes a <em>shinui</em>. Similarly, if the
            foods are very soft, then even those who are normally stringent
            allow mashing them with a fork. But in practice the primary
            position is the lenient one, as this is the position of practically
            all Rishonim.

            As explained in <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> §56, the permission to
            slice meat, cheese, and eggs is based on two principles:
        </p>
        <p>
            a) The prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> fundamentally pertains to
            foods that grow in the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            b) Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that the prohibition is limited to
            foods that cannot be eaten as is. Although it is true that some
            elderly people are unable to eat tough meat, nevertheless since
            most people are able to eat it, it is considered edible. However,
            one may not use a utensil that is specifically designed for
            grinding. According to MB 321:36 the prohibition is rabbinic, while
            according to <em>Nishmat Adam</em> 17:2 it is prohibited by Torah
            law.

            Everyone agrees that one who actually forms dough is transgressing
            a Torah prohibition, but the Tanna’im disagree whether adding water
            to flour is a Torah prohibition. According to R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi,
            one who adds water to flour is transgressing a Torah prohibition
            because he has taken the first step in the process of making dough;
            according to R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda, since one has not mixed the
            water and flour together, he has only transgressed a rabbinic
            prohibition (<em>Shabbat</em> 18a, 155b). Most <em>poskim</em>,
            including Rabbeinu Ĥananel, Rif, Rambam, Rosh, Ba’al Ha-Ma’or,
            Ramban, <em>Or Zaru’a</em>, <em>Roke’aĥ</em>, Rabbeinu Yeruĥam, and
            Me’iri maintain that the <em>halakha</em> follows R. Yossi Be-Rabbi
Yehuda. However, according to <em>Sefer Ha-Teruma</em>,<em>Yere’im</em>, <em>Smag</em>, and <em>Smak</em>, the            <em>halakha</em> follows R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi. (<em>Le-khatĥila</em>
            one should not wash his hands over dirt nor urinate into dirt,
            because R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda agrees that those actions are
            forbidden. In a time of need one may be lenient, as this is a case
            of a <em>psik reisha</em> <em>de-lo niĥa lei</em> involving a
            rabbinic prohibition. See MB 321:57.)
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some materials, such as ash, that are incapable of
            forming dough. If they are mixed with water they do form a type of
            mass, but it is not stable and it crumbles once it dries. There are
            three opinions regarding such materials:
        </p>
        <p>
            a) One may be more lenient regarding them. He may pour water on the
            ash, but mixing the two together is rabbinically prohibited
            (Rambam; Rid; Ritva; and implied by Rif and Rashi).
        </p>
        <p>
            b) One must be more stringent with them. Since they cannot really
            form a mass, one is liable as soon as water is poured on them, as
even R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda would agree (following Abaye in            <em>Shabbat</em> 18a; according to BHL 324:3 s.v. "ein" this is the
            ruling of <em>Tosafot</em>, Rosh, Raavad, Rashba, and Ran; it would
            also seem to be the opinion of <em>Sefer Ha-Teruma</em> and all who
            follow R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi’s ruling).
        </p>
        <p>
c) They are the same as any other material that is subject to            <em>Lash</em>. The Tanna’im disagree regarding the status of the
            prohibition of pouring water on them, but agree that mixing them is
prohibited by Torah law (following the opinion of R. Yosef;            <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 56:3 maintains that this is the opinion of most
            of the <em>poskim</em> mentioned in BHL).

            If the mixture is likely to solidify and harden on its own, then
            when one adds the water he is already transgressing the Torah
prohibition of <em>Lash</em>. This is because the essence of the            <em>melakha</em> is joining discrete particles into one solid mass.
Thus the Sages state that adding water to flax seeds is considered            <em>Lash</em>, because the water causes the seeds to secrete a
substance that causes them to stick to one another (            <em>Zevaĥim</em> 94b). Similarly, it is prohibited by Torah law to
            put cement, water, and aggregate together to form concrete;
            although the mixture starts out loose and pourable, the concrete
will subsequently solidify on its own (see            <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> 130:3). Therefore, one may not make
            gelatin desserts, as explained below in section 7.

            According to <em>Derisha</em>, a number of Rishonim maintain that
changing the order of the ingredients is sufficient. However,            <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> §53 maintains that one must also change
            the manner of stirring. SA 321:14 rules that one need not change
the manner of stirring (<em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:9:43;            <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 58:5 s.v. "u-mashma" seems inclined to rule this
way as well). However, according to MB 321:57 and            <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Mishpatim 18, it is preferable to
            change the manner of stirring as well as the order of the
            ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the ingredients are not usually added in any set order, one
should begin with the dry ingredients, according to<em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em>, <em>Eliya Rabba</em>,            <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em>, and <em>Ĥok Yaakov</em>. However,
            according to <em>Taz</em>, since in such a case it is impossible to
            change the order of the ingredients, making such a mixture is
            simply prohibited. This disagreement is cited by MB 321:57. Since
            this is a rabbinic law, one may rely on those who are lenient (SSK
            8:9; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:9:39).

            In <em>Shabbat</em> 156a we find that R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda
            permits making a thick dough of <em>mursan</em> (coarse bran) using
            a <em>shinui</em>. The law is dependent on two issues:
        </p>
        <p>
            a) Whom we follow in the disagreement between R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi and
R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda (mentioned above in n. 5). If the            <em>halakha</em> follows R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi, then the act of joining
            the two ingredients is forbidden by Torah law. If this is the case,
            then changing the order in which the ingredients are combined is
            not enough to permit an action that is otherwise prohibited by
Torah law (<em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> §53). However, if the            <em>halakha</em> follows R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda, then the joining
of the materials is only prohibited rabbinically (and according to            <em>Tosafot</em> it is permitted), so changing the order is a
            sufficient <em>shinui</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
b) Whether the Sages permit making thick dough using a<em>shinui</em>. According to Rambam and those who agree with him,            <em>mursan</em> is incapable of forming a proper dough, so mixing
            it is only prohibited rabbinically. Accordingly, the entire
            permission granted by R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda is limited to
            rabbinically<em> </em>prohibited kneading. (This is also the
            opinion of Rid and Ritva. SA quotes Rambam.) On the other hand,
            many Rishonim feel that <em>mursan</em> can be made into dough and
            doing so is thus prohibited by Torah law. Accordingly, R. Yossi
Be-Rabbi Yehuda permits this kind of kneading with a            <em>shinui</em>. (This disagreement is summarized in BHL 324:3 s.v.
            "ein.") In times of necessity, one may be lenient. This is because
            according to most <em>poskim</em>, the <em>halakha</em> regarding
            adding water follows R. Yossi Be-Rabbi Yehuda; since even those who
            are stringent agree that mixing with a <em>shinui</em> is only a
            rabbinic prohibition, the <em>halakha</em> follows those who are
            lenient. It can also be inferred from <em>Taz</em> and BHL that
            most <em>poskim</em> are lenient.

            One can be lenient if a <em>shinui</em> is used, as long as there
            is also a substantive doubt about whether <em>Lash</em> applies to
            the mixture under consideration. However, if only a small number of
            authorities maintain there is no prohibition of <em>Lash</em>,
            their opinion is not enough to allow forming a thick mixture, even
            with a <em>shinui</em>. Let us mention two lenient positions that
            should not be taken into account since only a few authorities
            follow them:
        </p>
        <p>
            a) It would seem that Rashba 4:75 allows forming a thick mixture
            for immediate consumption, and a few Aĥaronim take this position
            into account in ruling leniently (see <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §67). On
            the other hand, many did not accept Rashba’s position, and some
            maintain that even Rashba was stringent in this case.
            Alternatively, it is possible that Rashba is lenient only when the
            mixing is done in the course of eating. This means that two foods
            on one’s plate may be mixed together and consumed (even then it is
            doubtful whether one may be lenient; see SSK ch. 8 n. 10).
        </p>
        <p>
            b) Some maintain that just as <em>Toĥen</em> pertains only to
            produce but not to meat and eggs, so too <em>Lash</em> applies only
            to produce (Maharshak; see <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 11:36). However,
            according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, <em>Lash</em> does
            apply to other things besides produce, as <em>Igrot Moshe</em>
            states in OĤ 4:74, <em>Lash</em> §8.

            Some permit stirring vigorously in the normal way (<em>Taz</em>),
but many prohibit vigorous stirring (<em>Baĥ</em>, MA,            <em>Eliya Rabba</em>, MB 321:77). <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 58:9 maintains
            that if a food has dried out completely, like rice does after some
            time, it may not be mixed with liquids. In practice, in such a case
            one should mix with the <em>shinui</em> of stirring
            perpendicularly.

            The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether one may form a mixture using
            matza meal. Many prohibit doing so, maintaining that the matza meal
            has been processed to such an extent that its original pre-matza
            kneading is no longer relevant (<em>Taz</em>; MB 321:57). Others
            are inclined to be lenient (AHS <em>ad loc.</em> 20; Maharsham).
            Since the issue is in doubt, a <em>shinui</em> should be
            incorporated. Preparing couscous is less problematic, since one
            could argue that the individual grains do not really stick
together; in any case, in order to avoid any doubt, a            <em>shinui </em>should be incorporated when making this as well.

            SSK 8:28 permits making egg salad using a <em>shinui</em> even when
            it becomes a thick mixture (as it permits mashing eggs and cooked
            potatoes with a fork), and adds in n. 92 that this is the
            widespread custom. It suggests a number of reasons for this
            leniency. For starters, the egg is cooked and ready to eat, and the
            salad is not really one homogeneous mixture. Furthermore, if the
            egg salad is being prepared for a meal, only a small amount is
            being prepared, which counts as a <em>shinui</em>. We should add
            that as we saw above in n. 9, according to Rashba one may form a
            mixture when preparing the dish for immediate consumption. Further,
            some maintain that <em>Lash</em> applies only to foods that grow in
            the ground. On the other hand, some consider egg salad comparable
to vegetables, and are stringent if they form a mixture (            <em>Hilkhot Shabbat</em> <em>Be-Shabbat</em> 13:31). As we saw in
            section 5, when in doubt one may mix with a <em>shinui</em>. This
            has an additional advantage, as it is likely that if one mixes with
            a <em>shinui</em>, the mixture will not become integrated into a
            solid mass.

            In the past, some fruits were normally not juiced. <em>Shabbat</em>
            144b permits juicing such fruit: "One may squeeze plums, quinces,
and sorb apples." Although according to a few Rishonim (            <em>Smak</em> and Rabbeinu Yeruĥam) one may never juice any fruit,
            and a few Aĥaronim defer to their opinion (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em>
            14:3; <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Yitro 3), the majority of
            Rishonim and Aĥaronim allow those fruit to be juiced (SA 320:1; BHL
            s.v. "mutar"). However, today there are no fruits that are not
            juiced. Therefore, one may not squeeze any fruit in order to
            release its juice.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Ran, the Torah prohibition of juicing applies only to
            olives and grapes, because squeezing them creates important
            beverages - oil and wine. This is also implied by Rambam, and many
            Aĥaronim rule this way as well, including AHS 320:10. However,
            Rashi, Rashba, and Ritva maintain that it is prohibited by Torah
            law to juice any fruit, if the majority of that fruit’s crop is
            used to make juice.
        </p>
        <p>
            One may not wring out clothing that has absorbed liquid if one
wishes to use the liquid, because of the prohibition of            <em>Dash</em>. There is a disagreement whether this is prohibited
            rabbinically or by Torah law. If the wringing out will also clean
            the garment, then the Torah prohibition of laundering comes into
play. (See above 11:17 and in <em>Harĥavot</em>; below 13:5 and            <em>Harĥavot</em>.)

            However, SA 320:6 maintains that one may squeeze lemons into an
            empty pitcher; since people do not drink pure lemon juice, it has
            no importance. Thus, a lemon is categorized as a fruit that is
            never squeezed for its juice; as we saw in the previous note,
            according to most <em>poskim</em>, such fruits may be squeezed for
            their juice. In contrast, according to <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 14:4,
            one may not squeeze a lemon even into sugar, since one intends to
            turn the lemon into a drink. Most <em>poskim</em>, however,
maintain that one may squeeze a lemon into sugar (Ĥida;            <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Yitro 5; and MB 320:22).

            b) The prohibition of squeezing grapefruit and oranges, according
            to many, is only rabbinic. Many <em>poskim</em> have written this,
            including SSK ch. 5 n. 49. In <em>Shabbat</em> 143b, R. Yehuda
            maintains that if the juice left afterward on the plate flows out
            by itself from fruit designated for eating, one may drink this
            juice. If it flowed from olives and grapes, then even if they were
            set aside to be eaten, one may not drink the juice. (Since
            squeezing out the juice is a Torah prohibition, the Sages
            prohibited even juice that flowed out on its own.) This is the
            ruling of SA 320:1. Generally, when preparing fruit salad, even if
            grapes are used, most of the juice is from other fruits. Even if
            juice does flow out of the grapes, it mixes with the other fruits
and their juice. Therefore, one may drink the juice that remains. (            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 4 n. 44 states something similar to
            this.) The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether one may suck the juice
            out of a fruit held between the teeth. In practice, regarding
            grapes we are stringent, as squeezing them is a Torah prohibition
            (Rema 320:1). However, once a grape is actually in one’s mouth,
            there is no problem of squeezing (MB <em>ad loc.</em> 12).

            Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that the prohibition of dyeing does
not apply to food and drink (SA 320:9; <em>Darkhei Moshe</em>            <em>ad loc.</em> 2; <em>Ĥakham Tzvi</em> §92; <em>Mateh Yehuda</em>
318:2; and many others). However, some are stringent. For example,            <em>Nishmat Adam</em> 24:3 is concerned that it may even be
            prohibited by Torah law if the goal of the dyeing is to sell the
            food. BHL 320:19 rejects this. Nevertheless, there is a rabbinic
            prohibition of preparing on Shabbat for weekdays, and therefore one
            may not dye food in order to sell it (see MB 320:56). Others
            maintain that while it is true that the prohibition of dyeing does
            not apply to foods, there is a rabbinic prohibition to color drinks
            (<em>Rav Pe’alim</em>, OĤ 3:11 and <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2,
            Pekudei 3-4; <em>Ha-elef Lekha Shlomo</em> §336; <em>Lev Ĥayim</em>
            3:78). Although this is a rabbinic law, and most <em>poskim</em>
            are lenient (see <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 2:20), <em>le-khatĥila</em>
            it is preferable to be stringent. Even those who are stringent
allow mixing a clear drink into a colored one (            <em>Ĥesed La-alafim</em> 320:6; SHT 318:65). If the intent is to
            color, then it is reasonable to be stringent even when it comes to
food (<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Pekudei 3;<em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:13:8 and nn. 26, 30; SSK 11:39). See            <em>Harĥavot</em>.
