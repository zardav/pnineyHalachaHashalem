    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
As we learned, some <em>poskim</em> maintain that women must pray<em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> every day (above, 2:2). Other        <em>poskim</em> say that women are only obligated to pray one daily
        prayer, be it <em>Shaĥarit</em> or <em>Minĥa</em>, and although it is
        preferable to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em>, one who has difficulty praying in
        the morning may pray <em>Minĥa</em> (above, 2:3). In practice, it is
        best to pray both <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> in accordance
        with the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, but a woman who prays one
        prayer fulfills her obligation (above, 2:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Minĥa</em>
consists of <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. Although men recite        <em>Ashrei</em> before it and <em>Taĥanun</em> and <em>Aleinu</em>
        after it, women are not obligated to recite those passages. Still, a
        woman who does not recite <em>Ashrei</em> beforehand must wait a few
seconds, the amount of time it takes to walk a distance of four<em>amot</em> (as explained above, 10:11), before starting the        <em>Amida</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The time for <em>Minĥa</em> was established based on the time that the
        afternoon <em>Tamid</em> was offered – from half an hour after midday
        (six and a half seasonal hours into the day). Although, in principle,
        the time for offering the afternoon <em>Tamid</em> begins at midday,
        the Sages were concerned that people would err in estimating the
        position of the sun and cause the offering to be brought before midday;
therefore, they fixed the earliest time for the afternoon        <em>Tamid</em> at half an hour after midday.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The time for <em>Minĥa</em> lasts until evening; however, the        <em>poskim</em> disagree about <em>Minĥa</em>’s precise final time. The
disagreement hinges on the deadline for bringing the afternoon<em>Tamid</em>. Some say only until sunset (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>, Gra, MB 233:14), but most        <em>poskim </em>say until nightfall (SA<em> </em>Rema 233:1). In
        practice, one must try to finish reciting <em>Minĥa</em> before sunset.
However, <em>be-di’avad</em>, one may rely on the opinion of most        <em>poskim</em> and pray within another 13.5 minutes after sunset, for
all agree that in every season night does not begin before then (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 24:4).

2. <em>Keri’at Shema </em>of <em>Ma’ariv</em> and its            <em> Berakhot</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is a biblical commandment to recite <em>Shema</em> at night and in
        the morning, as the Torah states in the paragraphs of <em>Shema</em>
        and <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em>: "When you lie down and when you rise."
        It is also a mitzva to mention the Exodus during the day and at night,
        as the Torah states: "So that you remember the day you left Egypt every
        day of your life" (Devarim 16:3). The Torah seems to add a superfluous
word ("<em>kol yemei ĥayekha</em>" instead of just "        <em>yemei ĥayekha</em>"), from which the Sages derive that the mitzva
to remember the Exodus is performed both during the day and at night (        <em>Berakhot</em> 12b). For that reason, <em>Va-yomer</em> is also
recited at night, since it mentions the Exodus at the end.        <em>Va-yomer</em>, which discusses the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>,
        primarily applies to the day, and although one can fulfill the
        nighttime mitzva of mentioning the Exodus with other verses, common
        practice is to recall it by reciting <em>Va-yomer</em>, since it is
        familiar to all (<em>Tosafot Yom Tov</em> <em>ad loc.</em>). Combined
        with the first two paragraphs, it contains 248 words (above, 16:11),
        and by reciting all three paragraphs, one fully accepts the yoke of
        heaven (above, 16:4-5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Men of the Great Assembly added two <em>berakhot</em> before and
two after the recitation of <em>Shema</em>. The first,        <em>Ha-ma’ariv Aravim</em>, praises God for the changing times. The
        second, <em>Ahavat Olam</em>, praises God for loving Israel and giving
        us the Torah. The third, <em>Emet Ve-emuna</em>, praises God as our
        Redeemer. In the fourth <em>berakha</em>, <em>Hashkiveinu</em>, we ask
God to protect us at night and watch over us when we sleep. Hence,        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> are comprised of seven blessings, three
in <em>Shaĥarit</em> and four in <em>Ma’ariv</em>.        <em>Y. Berakhot </em>1:5 states that they were instituted based on the
        verse "<em>Sheva ba-yom hilaltikha</em>" ("I praise You seven times
        daily") (Tehilim 119:164; see above, 16:12).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Since the <em>mitzvot </em>of <em>Keri’at Shema</em>, the recitation of
        its <em>berakhot</em>, and mentioning the Exodus are all time-bound
        commandments, women are exempt from them (see above, 16:3). The time
for <em>Shema</em> begins at <em>tzeit ha-kokhavim</em> and lasts until<em>ĥatzot</em> (halakhic midnight). <em>Be-di’avad</em>,        <em>Shema</em> may be recited with its <em>berakhot</em> until dawn.

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Although women are exempt from positive time-bound commandments, one
        who wishes to voluntarily fulfill them is credited for it. Since women
        regularly recite the first paragraph of <em>Shema</em> before going to
        sleep as part of a prayer for protection, it is best that while saying
        it she has in mind to fulfill the mitzva of <em>Keri’at Shema</em> as
        well, thus performing the nighttime mitzva of <em>Shema</em>.

        <a name="_Toc402175304">3. The <em>Ma’ariv Amida</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As we learned (above, 1:7), the Yaakov ordained <em>Ma’ariv</em>, and
        on this basis, the Men of the Great Assembly<em> </em>established
praying <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> at night. They fixed the time for        <em>Ma’ariv </em>to correspond to the burning of the limbs and suet of
        the sacrifices, for whatever was not offered during the day was burned
throughout the night (<em>Berakhot</em> 26b). In essence, however,        <em>Ma’ariv</em> is voluntary (<em>reshut</em>), that is, a mitzva but
        not an obligation. <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> are different
from <em>Ma’ariv</em> because they were instituted to correspond to the        <em>Tamid</em> offerings, that is, corresponding to the sprinkling of
        their blood. Just as one who does not sprinkle the blood does not
        fulfill his obligation of bringing the offering, so too, one is
obligated to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>. However,        <em>Ma’ariv</em> was instituted to correspond to the offering of the
        limbs and suet upon the altar. Although it is a mitzva to bring them,
if they were not brought, the offering still remained valid. Therefore,        <em>Ma’ariv</em> is voluntary. That is, one who was interested in
        engaging in a different mitzva, had already gone to sleep in bed, or
        found it difficult to pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> for any other reason, was
        not required to do so.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Nevertheless, throughout the generations, all Jewish men regularly
        prayed <em>Ma’ariv</em>, and by the time of the Rishonim it was already
        established as an obligation. Even so, because of <em>Ma’ariv</em>’s
voluntary character, as the Sages did not institute        <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz </em>for it, as it is designed to help the
        uneducated fulfill their obligations (SA 237:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from <em>Ma’ariv</em> even according to those who
        maintain that women must pray all the prayers instituted by the Sages.
        A woman’s obligation pertains to <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa,</em>
which were established as obligatory. She is exempt from        <em>Ma’ariv</em>, which is voluntary, and the men’s acceptance of the
        practice as an obligation does not extend to her. A woman who wants to
        pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> is praiseworthy, and this is the practice of some
        righteous women.

            To ensure that no one will forget to pray <em>Minĥa</em>, the Sages
            instituted that from the time of <em>ĥatzot</em> onward, one must
            be careful not to begin actions that will likely cause him to be so
distracted that he will forget to pray, as explained in SA 232:2            <em>and Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 24:5-6. The <em>poskim</em> do
            not say that these prohibitions pertain to women, and it seems that
            even women who regularly pray <em>Minĥa</em> need not take these
            precautions. Possibly because women may fulfill their obligation of
            prayer by reciting only <em>Shaĥarit</em> and possibly because
            women were at home and were not preoccupied work or preparations
            for long meals, the Sages did not institute these safeguard because
            they Sages did not make enactments about uncommon occurrences.
            Based on this, even according to the <em>poskim</em> who maintain
            that women must pray <em>Minĥa</em>, the precautionary prohibitions
            do not apply. As with other <em>mitzvot</em>, one must simply plan
            her time properly.

            <em>Tzeit ha-kokhavim</em>
            is the time when three medium-sized stars are visible. An
            uncertainty arises: Does this mean the time when people with good
            eyesight, who are experts on the positions of the stars, can see
            them or the time when people with normal vision can see them? In
practice, according to the widespread custom, one may begin            <em>Ma’ariv</em> twenty minutes after sunset. The time to recite
            the nighttime <em>Shema</em>, according to the Torah, is all night,
            but the Sages created a safeguard and required people to recite it
            by <em>ĥatzot</em>. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, one who did not pray in
            time has until dawn to recite. <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
            25:5 and 8 discusses this issue at length.

There are several opinions about the status of men vis-à-vis<em>Ma’ariv</em>. According to most Rishonim, including            <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>, and Rosh, the
            mitzva to pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> should not be skipped for no reason
            but may be skipped for a slight reason. This is my ruling above.
            However, <em>Behag</em> maintains that it is truly voluntary and
            may be skipped for no reason. See <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
            25:2.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Based on this, it seems that according to the majority of            <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women must pray all the prayers,
            as cited above, chapter 2 n. 1, women may not skip <em>Ma’ariv</em>
            without cause. This is implied in <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 299:62,
which states that women who know how to pray regularly pray            <em>Ma’ariv</em>. <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>6:3 nn. 1 and 4 state
that this is also implicit in the words of Rabbeinu Yona and            <em>Shlah</em>. Indeed, there are righteous women who pray three
times a day. However, it seems that even Rabbeinu Yona and<em>Shlah</em> would concede that women did not accept            <em>Ma’ariv</em> as an obligation; the most one can say is that
            according to their opinion <em>Ma’ariv</em> is voluntary for women
            and may not be skipped without cause. However, in practice, the
accepted ruling and practice is that women are exempt from            <em>Ma’ariv </em>because: a) according to many <em>poskim</em>
            women are only obligated to pray once daily, as explained above,
            2:3; b) the prevailing interpretation of the majority view, that
            women must pray all the prayers, is that it only refers to
            obligatory prayers; c) even if this view extends to voluntary
prayers, according to <em>Behag</em>, men, too, may skip<em>Ma’ariv</em> for no reason; d) even according to            <em>Tosafot</em>, who maintain that <em>Ma’ariv</em> should not be
skipped without reason, women may be completely exempt from            <em>Ma’ariv</em> since they are often preoccupied with childcare.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <strong>The time for <em>Ma’ariv</em></strong>
,<strong> </strong>according to the Sages, begins at            <em>tzeit ha-kokhavim</em>, and that is the prevailing practice. R.
Yehuda maintains that the time for <em>Ma’ariv</em> begins at            <em>plag ha-minĥa</em> (one and one-quarter seasonal hour before
            the end of the day). Those who wish to follow R. Yehuda may do so,
on condition that they pray <em>Minĥa</em> before            <em>plag ha-minĥa</em>. The prevalent custom today is to follow the
Sages. This is explained at length in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 25:6-7. Regarding the latest time
            to pray, <em>Derekh Ha-ĥayim</em> states that <em>le-khatĥila</em>
it is until <em>ĥatzot</em>, whereas according to<em>Pri Megadim</em>, even <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is all night.            <strong></strong>
