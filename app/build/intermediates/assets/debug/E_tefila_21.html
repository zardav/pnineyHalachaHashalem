    Chapter Twenty-One: <strong><em>Nefillat Apayim</em> and the Prayers of Supplication</strong>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Uniqueness of the<em> Nefillat Apayim </em>Prayer
</h2>
<p>
After the conclusion of the <em>Amidah</em>, it is customary to "fall on one's face" (<em>Nefillat Apayim</em>) and recite prayers of supplication (<em>Tachanun</em>) before Hashem. By doing so, we fulfill the mitzvah of prayer in all of its positions - <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> while sitting,    <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> while standing, and the prayers of supplication that follow, in prostration. We learn this from Moshe Rabbeinu, who prayed in those
    three positions on behalf of the nation of Israel after the sin of the Golden Calf, as it is written, "I sat on the mountain" (Deuteronomy 9:9); "I stood
    on the mountain" (ibid., 10:10); and "I threw myself down before Hashem" (ibid., 9:25). So too, we in our prayers, after having prayed while sitting and
    standing, are left with a feeling that we have not yet expressed everything, that we have not yet broken down the barriers completely, so we prostrate
    ourselves in submission to the Master of the Universe (see <em>Tur</em> 131).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>
    possesses a special power and is the most effective prayer in times of trouble. An illustration of this can be found in the dispute of Korach and his
    followers, when Hashem told Moshe and Aharon, "Separate yourselves from this group and I will destroy them in an instant." They immediately understood the
    need to pray intensely. Therefore, they prayed in prostration, as it is written, "They fell on their faces and prayed, 'Omnipotent God of all living souls,
    if one man sins, shall You direct Divine wrath at the entire community?'" (Numbers 16:21-22). From the intensity of their prayer recited in prostration,
    the decree was overturned.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>
    is so powerful because it expresses one's complete surrender towards the Creator until a person reaches total sacrifice of his soul. It is as if the person
    is saying to the Master of the Universe, "All my senses and organs are void before You. Do to me as You will, for I am all Yours." Therefore, with the
    prayer of <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> it is possible to repair flaws which cannot be rectified through regular prayer (see <em>Zohar</em> Numbers 120:2).
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, there is also an expression of shame towards Heaven. After having prayed the <em>Amidah</em>, in which we were engaged in the
    greatness of the Blessed One, and in which we presented all our requests, here we are, embarrassed to show our faces. How did we dare stand before Him in
    prayer? Therefore, we fall on our faces. Furthermore, <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> conveys the sorrow which derives from repentance, for due to the anguish
    over our wrongdoings, we cannot lift our faces (see <em>Rabbeinu Bechaye</em> Numbers 16:22).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. The Custom of Its Recital
</h2>
<p>
    Despite its great virtue, the <em>Chachamim</em> did not establish <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> to be an obligatory prayer, and they did not institute a set
    wording for it. Anyone who so desired would add prayers of supplication in prostration after reciting the <em>Amidah</em>. Perhaps specifically because of
    its superior value, being that it expresses total submission to the Creator, May He Be Blessed, it is befitting that it emanates from the heart, from one's
    most inner resolve.
</p>
<p>
    During the period of the <em>Geonim</em>, a permanent wording for <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, and the prayers of supplication after the <em>Amidah</em>,
    began to take shape. In the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>, the wording became established, until all Jews accepted upon themselves the obligation to recite
    certain specific supplications. Seemingly, as a result of the suffering of the Diaspora, which continued to intensify, our hearts were dulled. This
    necessitated the introduction of a permanent wording of supplication. Because the <em>nusach</em> of the supplications became widespread only after the
    scattering of the exiles, the differences between the <em>Sephardic</em> and<em> Ashkenazic</em> wordings are more pronounced.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> prayer expresses heartbreak, manifested by the submission of one's body and sacrifice of one's soul. Therefore, it is not
recited on holidays, or days of joy due to the celebration of a special mitzvah like a <em>brit milah</em>. The kabbalists explain that all the    <em>tikkunim</em> (rectifications) performed on regular days via the <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> prayer are achieved on days of a mitzvah celebration purely
    through the joyous sanctity of the day (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 131:54). Additionally, when those celebrating such a joyous mitzvah are present in the
    synagogue, prayers of supplication are not recited (as explained in <em>halachot</em> 7 and 8). We have already learned that, in principle, there is no
    obligation to recite <em>Tachanun</em>, and therefore in any situation in which there is doubt as to whether <em>Tachanun</em> should be said, the
    instruction is not to recite it.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, in a house of mourning, it is customary not to recite <em>Tachanun</em>, since the Divine attribute of judgment (<em>midat hadin</em>) is
present there, and care should be taken not to amplify it (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:20). The idea behind this is that the person praying    <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> demonstrates to himself that his existence is dependent on Hashem, and that he is null and void in relation to Him. Since a
    mourner already has an acute sense of this, it is unnecessary to add to it.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. What Is <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>?
</h2>
<p>
    At first, it was customary to perform the <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> prayer by prostrating or by bowing down. Prostration means that the person drops his
    whole body to the ground, and spreads out his hands and feet. Bowing means that the person gets down on his knees, bends his head forward, and rests it
    down on the ground (<em>Berachot</em> 34b; <em>Rambam Tefillah</em> 5:13-14).
</p>
<p>
    However, due to a number of concerns, the custom to pray <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> by bowing down or prostrating oneself on the ground was annulled. Some of
    the reasons are halachic, dealing with the prohibition against prostrating oneself on a stone floor; and the prohibition of an important person falling on
    his face before the congregation without a guarantee that he will be answered like Yehoshua bin Nun.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    Still, the main reason is written in the <em>Zohar</em> (Numbers 121:1), which greatly reinforces the virtue of <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, during which the
    person praying must sacrifice his soul to Hashem and view himself as if he has left the world, thereby atoning for all his sins. "This restorative act must
    be performed with great <em>kavanah</em> of one's heart. Then <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> has mercy on him and absolves his sins. Great is the person who
    knows how to entice his Master and eagerly serve Him with <em>kavanah</em> of the heart. Woe to the one who entices his Master with a distant heart bereft
    of desire. As it is written (Psalms 78:36-7), 'They beguiled Him with their mouths and lied to Him with their tongue, for their heart was untrue to Him.'
    He says, 'I lift my soul up to You' (Psalms 25:1), but his words emanate from a distant heart, and that causes him to leave this world before his time."
    Since we are concerned that perhaps we are unable to have the necessary full <em>kavanah</em> and are unworthy, we refrain from prostrating ourselves, or
    from bowing down.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, it is the custom of all <em>Ashkenazim</em> and some <em>Sephardim</em> to bend down and cover their faces on the shirtsleeve of their arm. By
    doing so, one maintains a certain aspect of <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, for that is a type of bow, yet it is not a complete bow, and there is no fear of
prostration on a stone floor (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 131:1). Perhaps so as not to encounter the danger mentioned in the <em>Zohar</em>,    <em>Ashkenazim</em> were accustomed not to recite the psalm "<em>Eilecha Hashem Nafshi Essa</em>" ("I lift my soul up to You") (Psalm 25), which is
explained in the <em>Zohar</em> to mean the surrender of one's soul, and instead they recite Psalm 6 (<em>Magen Avraham </em>131:5). Those who follow the<em>Ben Ish Chai</em> are careful not to fall on their faces at all, and that is how many people from <em>Eidot HaMizrach</em> practice.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. How to Perform <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>
</h2>
<p>
    As mentioned, according to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, and of some <em>Sephardim</em>, <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> is performed by lowering one's head and
    leaning it on the arm. In the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, one always falls on his left arm. According to the <em>Rama</em>, in the morning,
    when one's <em>tefillin</em> is placed on his left arm, he falls on his right arm, and at<em> Minchah</em>, he falls on his left arm - this is the
    Ashkenazic custom (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em> 131:1;<em> Mishnah Berurah</em> 6).
</p>
<p>
    When falling on the left arm, we tilt our faces slightly to the right, so as not to point them straight down to the floor. Similarly, when we fall on the
    right arm, we tilt our faces slightly to the left. We practice this just as it was practiced when people were accustomed to actually prostrating themselves
on the ground, for in those times, they tilted their faces as a "fence" against the prohibition of prostrating oneself on a stone floor (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:40; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 131:1).
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to cover one's face with clothing. It is not sufficient to conceal one's head with his arm, since the arm and the face are one body, and
    the body cannot cover itself (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:3). The main purpose of this covering is for the sake of modesty, like that of a person who
    hides his face from Hashem out of trepidation and shame. One who is wearing short sleeves, and has a handkerchief, should place it on his arm and place his
    face on it. However, if he does not have a handkerchief, he may fall on his bare arm, but not on his palm, since it is impossible to hide one's face with
one's palm. If there is a table there, he rests his arm and head on it, and the table is considered the main cover for his face.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to perform <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> only in places where a Torah scroll is present, or even other printed <em>sifrei kodesh</em> (sacred
    texts). In a place in which there are no sacred texts, the prayer is recited while sitting, without falling on one's arm.
</p>
<p>
    When<em> Nefillat Apayim</em> is performed in the rooms adjacent to the synagogue, which do not contain a Torah scroll or sacred books, if it is possible
    to see the <em>aron kodesh</em> (holy ark) from there, one falls on his face. However, when the <em>aron kodesh</em> cannot be seen, the prayer is recited
    while sitting.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    In Jerusalem, it is customary to perform <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> even in a place without sacred texts, since the sanctity of the city serves as a
    substitute for the texts.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    In a place where it is impossible for someone to recite the <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> prayer while sitting, such as in a place without a chair, or in a
    place in which another person is praying the <em>Amidah</em> directly behind him and he cannot go elsewhere, he may stand (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    131:10). It is best that one leans against a wall in such a way that without it he would fall, so that his prayer is considered to be recited partially
    sitting and partially in the position of <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 38).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Thirteen Attributes of Mercy
</h2>
<p>
    After Hashem forgave Israel for the sin of the Golden Calf, and even agreed that Israel would be favored among all the nations in its special connection
    with Him, Moshe Rabbeinu implored, "Please let me have a vision of Your glory." Hashem replied, "I will make all My good pass before you, and reveal the
    Divine Name in your presence," meaning, I will disclose to you My Holy Name that is revealed to the world; however, it is impossible to grasp My essence,
    "For a person cannot see Me and live" (Exodus 33:18-20). "Hashem descended in a cloud, and stood there with Moshe, and he (Moshe) called out in Hashem's
    Name. Hashem passed before him and proclaimed (Hashem called out and revealed His Names to Moshe), 'Hashem, Hashem, merciful and gracious God, slow to
    anger, with tremendous kindness and truth. He remembers deeds of kindness for thousands [of generations], forgiving sin, iniquity, and error, and He
    cleanses'" (Exodus 34:5-7). These are the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy.
</p>
<p>
Rabbi Yochanan said, "Were the verse not written, it would be impossible to say it. This teaches us that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> wrapped Himself like a    <em>chazan</em> and demonstrated to Moshe the order of the prayer. He said to him, 'Any time that Israel sins, let them perform before Me this procedure
    and I will forgive them'" (<em>Rosh HaShanah </em>17b).
</p>
<p>
    With the acceptance of faith on the most supreme level, attained by reciting the Thirteen Attributes, we connect to Hashem in such a profound and exalted
    manner that our sins become marginal and exterior. In that state, atonement is achieved.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, in <em>Selichot</em>, on fast days and Yom Kippur, the Thirteen Attributes are recited numerous times in the prayer service. The customs vary
    regarding their recital on weekdays. According to the Ashkenazic and Yemenite (Baladi) <em>minhagim</em>, they are recited only on Mondays and Thursdays
    since those are the appropriate days for saying prayers of supplication. According to the Sephardic <em>minhag</em> (including Sephard-Chassidi), based on
    the <em>Ari</em>, they are recited every time there is <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The recital of the Thirteen Attributes is considered a matter of sanctity and therefore necessitates a <em>minyan</em>. One who prays individually is not
permitted to recite them; however, he is allowed to read them with cantillation signs as one reading the Torah (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,    <em> Orach Chaim</em> 565:5; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 12). Whoever has not yet succeeded in finishing "<em>Kel erech apayim</em>" before the congregation
    reaches the Thirteen Attributes must stop and join in with the congregation. As long as the congregation has not yet finished reciting the Thirteen
Attributes of Mercy, he may still join them. However, if they have already finished, he is considered to be reciting them as an individual (    <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Ki Tisa</em> 4).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. The Passages of Supplication and <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is proper not to interrupt by talking between <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and <em>Tachanun</em>, because when the recital of the prayers of supplication is
    linked to <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, the prayers are more favorably accepted (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 131:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 1).
</p>
<p>
    Concerning the <em>nusach</em> of <em>Tachanun</em>, there are differences between the various ethnic groups. The reason for this is that when most Jews
    lived in Israel or in Babylon, each person would recite prayers of supplication in his own tongue. Only later on, in the time of the <em>Rishonim</em>,
when the exiles dispersed, certain set wordings took shape. Additionally, approximately four hundred years ago, some changes were made in    <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, based on <em>Kavanot HaAri</em>.
</p>
<p>
According to <em>Kavanot HaAri</em>, it is customary to recite <em>Vidui</em> (confession) and the Thirteen Attributes of mercy before the Psalm of    <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, so that after achieving atonement from the recital of <em>Vidui</em> and the Thirteen Attributes, one arrives at the pinnacle of
these prayers, <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 131:5). According to the Ashkenazic and Yemenite (Baladi) <em>minhag</em>, we open with    <em>Vidui</em> and the Thirteen Attributes only on Mondays and Thursdays, the days when we recite numerous prayers of supplication. However, on the
remaining days, we say <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> immediately following the <em>Amidah</em>, because it is best to adjoin <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> to the    <em>Amidah</em> as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
In <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, according to the Sephardic<em> Nusach</em>, Psalm 25 is recited, whereas those who follow <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> and    <em>Sephard-Chassidi</em> say Psalm 6.
</p>
<p>
    On Mondays and Thursdays, additional prayers of supplication are recited, since those days are days of Divine grace when prayer is more graciously
    accepted. They are said while standing (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em> 134:1). The prayer "<em>V'Hu Rachum</em>" was compiled by three elders
    exiled from Jerusalem, as explained in the writings of the <em>Rishonim</em> (<em>Abudraham</em>, <em>Ra'avan</em>, <em>Manhig</em>, <em>Kolbo</em> 18).
    Distinctions in wording between the various customs are slight, except that the <em>Sephardim</em> add more prayers of supplication<em> </em>before it and
    the <em>Ashkenazim</em> add prayers of supplication after it.
</p>
<p>
Another difference is that in <em>Nusach Sephard</em> the additional prayers of supplication<em> </em>of Mondays and Thursdays are recited after    <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, whereas in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> they are recited before <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>.
</p>
<p>
    A person who practices according to one <em>nusach</em> and prays in a place in which most people are praying in another <em>nusach</em> is permitted to
    pray as he wishes. If he decides to follow his own custom, he should not make his different <em>minhag</em> noticeable. If the <em>chazan</em> is reciting
    the Thirteen Attributes, even one who does not have the custom to recite them must join the congregation. Someone reciting a longer <em>nusach</em> when
    the <em>chazan</em> starts saying <em>Kaddish</em>,<em> </em>must stop his prayers of supplication, respond to <em>Kaddish</em>, and continue on to the
    next stage of the prayer service. The reason for this is that the exact wording of the prayers of supplication<em> </em>does not prevent a person from
    fulfilling his obligation, and anyone who recited even a few prayers of supplication has already fulfilled his obligation. If he so desires, he may finish
    the prayers of supplication<em> </em>after the prayer service.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Days on Which <em>Tachanun</em> Is Not Recited
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> prayer is one that expresses sorrow concerning our errors and shortcomings, which prevent us from standing before Hashem.
    Instead, we fall on our faces. For that reason, it is not proper to recite it on days of joy. Since, in its essence, the <em>Tachanun</em> prayer is
    voluntary, it is therefore customary not to recite <em>Tachanun</em> even on days that are deemed uncertain as to whether or not they should be defined as
    days of joy (the sources for these laws can be found in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 131:6-7 and in the commentaries).
</p>
<p>
    On the following days, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited: Shabbat, Festivals, <em>Chol HaMo'ed</em>, and <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>. The remaining days are
presented in the order of the calendar year: <em>Shacharit</em> of <em>Erev Rosh HaShanah</em>; <em>Shacharit</em> of <em>Erev Yom Kippur</em>; from the 11    <sup>th</sup> of Tishrei until the end of the month of Tishrei, since those days surround the Festival of Sukkot; Chanukah; Tu BiShvat; the two days of
    Purim, and in leap years also on the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of Adar I; the entire month of Nisan, since most of it possesses sanctity, for the
    dedication of the Tabernacle was held in the beginning of the month and the holiday of Pesach<em> </em>follows; the 14<sup>th</sup> of Iyar, which is
    Pesach Sheni; Lag BaOmer; from <em>Rosh Chodesh Sivan</em> to the 12<sup>th</sup> of Sivan, since the supplementary sacrifices for Shavuot were offered
    until that time; Tish'ah B'Av (either because of mourning or because it is called a <em>mo'ed</em>); and Tu B'Av. Additionally, at the <em>Minchah</em>
    service preceding all these days, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited, except for <em>Minchah</em> of <em>Erev Rosh HaShanah</em> and <em>Erev Yom Kippur</em>
    , when many people recite <em>Vidui</em> then, but not <em>Tachanun</em>.
</p>
<p>
Today, ever since Hashem began to bring forth our redemption, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited on Yom HaAtzma'ut (Israel's Independence Day), and on the 28    <sup>th</sup> of Iyar, Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Liberation Day), nor at <em>Minchah</em> before each of them.
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. <em>Chatan</em>, <em>Ba'alei Brit</em>, and Other <em>Ba'alei Simchah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Tachanun</em>
is not recited in a <em>minyan</em> in which <em>ba'alei simchah</em> (those celebrating a joyous mitzvah celebration) are praying. Therefore,    <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited in a <em>minyan</em> in which a <strong><em>chatan</em></strong> (groom) within his seven days of festivity is praying.
    However, in <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Minchah</em> before his wedding, <em>Tachanun</em> is recited, although if <em>Minchah</em> is prayed close to the
    ceremony at the wedding hall, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
Similarly, in a <em>minyan</em> in which one of the <strong><em>ba'alei habrit</em></strong> is praying, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited. The    <em>ba'alei habrit</em> are: the father of the baby being circumcised, the <em>mohel</em>, and the <em>sandak</em>. This exemption lasts from the morning
until the celebration meal (<em>seudah</em>); that is, if the <em>brit</em> is held in the morning, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited in the<em>Shacharit </em>service. If the <em>brit</em> is held after <em>Minchah</em>, <em>Tachanun</em> is omitted in both <em>Shacharit</em> and    <em>Minchah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:22; and see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 19).
</p>
<p>
Not only in a <em>minyan</em> in which one of the <em>ba'alei habrit</em> is praying is <em>Tachanun</em> not recited, but even in the<strong>synagogue</strong> in which the <em>brit</em> is held, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited. In a building in which there are a number of prayer halls,    <em>Tachanun</em> is omitted only in the particular hall in which the <em>brit</em> will be held.<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bar Mitzvah</strong>
    : many are accustomed not to say <em>Tachanun</em> in a <em>minyan</em> in which a youth who is reaching the age of <em>mitzvot</em> on that day is
    praying, though some do recite it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Pidyon HaBen</em></strong>
    : many are accustomed not to recite <em>Tachanun</em> in a <em>minyan</em> in which the father of the son is praying, yet some do.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, in a prayer service adjoined to the ceremony of a conclusion of a tractate (<em>siyum</em>), or the presentation of a Torah scroll (    <em>hachnasat sefer Torah</em>), many are accustomed not to recite <em>Tachanun</em>, though some do.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
    We already learned that when there is doubt as to whether or not to say <em>Tachanun</em>, the correct way to practice is not to recite it (as brought in
    halachah 1).
</p>
<p>
    On days of public celebration in memory of prominent Jewish rabbis and righteous people (<em>Yahrtzeit</em> or <em>Hilulah</em>), the opinion of the
    absolute majority of <em>poskim</em> is that it is necessary to say <em>Tachanun</em>, and that is the custom. The Chassidic <em>poskim</em> maintain that
    those who follow in the ways of a particular righteous person, engross themselves in his teachings throughout the year, and prepare a feast in his honor on
    the anniversary of his passing from this world, do not recite <em>Tachanun</em> on that day. However, on the remaining celebration days in memory of other
    righteous people, <em>Tachanun</em> must be recited.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>

            The <em>Tur</em> section 131 writes in the name of <em>Rav Natrunai Gaon</em> that since <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> is voluntary, it is customary not
to recite it in the<em> </em>house of a<em> chatan</em> (groom), as writes <em>Shut HaRivash</em> 412 in the name of <em>Rav Sar Shalom Gaon</em>.            <em>Rabbi Yitzchak Ibn Giat</em> proves this with the story from <em>Bava Metzia</em> 59b about Imma Shalom, Rabbi Eliezer's wife, who would not
            let Rabbi Eliezer say prayers of supplication after the <em>Amidah</em> so as not to cause harm to her brother, Rabban Gamliel. It is from here we
            learn that it is not an obligatory prayer. Other <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> have written this as well. <em>Birkei Yosef</em> 131:13
            and <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 131:15 write that in any case of uncertainty, it is better not to recite <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, since it is
            voluntary.

            The basis for the prohibition to prostrate oneself on a kneeling stone is brought in <em>Megillah</em> 22b and it is cited by the <em>Rama</em>
            131:8. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:40 explains that the biblical prohibition entails prostrating oneself on a stone floor, as it is written
            (Leviticus 26:1), "Do not place a kneeling stone in your land upon which to prostrate yourselves." This prohibition has two conditions: 1)
            prostration, and 2) a stone floor. The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted a prohibition even when only one condition exists, meaning that prostration is
            forbidden even on a floor that is not made of stone, and even just bowing down on a stone floor is forbidden. <em>Chazal</em> do permit bowing down
            on a floor that is not made of stone. If there are stones there, one may bow by leaning on his side, or by making a separation between his head and
            the floor, with a towel or the like. Likewise, it is permissible to prostrate oneself on a floor without stones provided that one leans slightly on
            his side. There is uncertainty as to whether one may prostrate oneself on a stone floor using a separation. See <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 44.

            Further, <em>Chazal</em> write in <em>Megillah</em> 22b that a prominent person is forbidden to fall on his face unless he knows for certain that
he will be answered as was Yehoshua bin Nun, and that is how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 131:8 rules. However, when he is alone, the<em>Tosafot</em> write based on the <em>Yerushalmi</em>, that it is permissible, and so writes the <em>Beit Yosef </em>in the name of some            <em>Rishonim</em>. Similarly, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 38 rules that the prohibition applies when he is the only one falling on his face in
            front of the congregation, like Yehoshua bin Nun. In a situation such as that one, were he not answered, he would feel ashamed, for those who see
            him would think he is not worthy. Still, it can be inferred from the <em>Rambam</em> that the prohibition for a prominent person applies even when
            he is alone. The <em>Meiri</em> explains that this prohibition is to prevent one from considering himself overly pious. See <em>Yad Peshutah</em>
            on <em>Rambam Tefillah</em> 5:14 where he brings the responsa of <em>Rav Sherira Gaon</em> and <em>Rav Hai Gaon</em>, which implies that when the
            congregation would prostrate themselves or bow down on the ground, the rabbis would elevate themselves slightly from the floor and turn their faces
            to the side, and the most prominent rabbis would not bow down at all. Perhaps also for this reason, the custom not to prostrate oneself or bow
            down, spread throughout the rest of the nation.

The <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Ki Tisa</em> 13, writes that perhaps just resting one's head on his arm is to a certain degree what the            <em>Zohar</em> intended, that whoever does not have the proper <em>kavanah</em> is endangering his life. Therefore, "It is good that every person
            refrain from placing his face on his arm and he should not change his position in any way." So writes the <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em>, part 6, end of
            section 7. However, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 131:1 rules that one must fall on his face, and that is the opinion of the <em>Chida</em> as well.
            Even the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 131:31 writes that anyone who does not intend to lower his soul to the forces of evil in order to purify them, but
            rather solely intends to surrender his soul for the sake of Torah observance and the fulfillment of <em>mitzvot</em>, does not endanger himself. It
            is written in the <em>Siddur</em> <em>Od Avinu Chai</em> (based on <em>Rav Rakach</em>) that the <em>minhag</em> of all the North African ethnic
            groups (Spanish emigrants) was to fall on their faces. In practice, every person should follow his own family's <em>minhag</em>.

            The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 131:1 clarifies that with the way we fall on our faces today, there is no concern of transgressing the prohibition of
            prostrating oneself on a kneeling stone, since our heads are very far away from the floor. Therefore, even if the floor is made of stone, it is not
            forbidden, since there are two differences here from the biblical prohibition: 1) this is not prostration, and 2) one's face is not touching the
            ground. If so, the custom to lean on one's side exists to remember the <em>minhag</em> when people were accustomed to bowing down completely on the
            ground, and if the floor was stone, they would have to bow with their head to the side. According to this, even the covering of one's face does not
            serve as a separation between one's face and the ground; rather the falling on one's face is to hide his face in shame. Perhaps even the covering
            of oneself with clothing is to remember the fact that they used to bow down completely on the ground, for then if it was a stone floor, one could
            either turn his face or make a separation between himself and the floor. However, from the <em>Magen Avraham</em> 131, paragraphs 2 and 20, it can
            be inferred that even when one's face is far from the ground, it is still considered bowing down, and therefore he is obligated to lean on his side
            or make a separation between his face and the ground. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> questions this, and it is his view that nowadays, the custom to
            lean exists only to remember the custom of bowing down.

            If so, when one does not have a sleeve or piece of fabric, it seems that he may cover his face with his bare arm, for not having fabric does not
            prevent one from fulfilling his obligation. If there is a table or lectern (<em>shtender</em>) there, it is best that one rest his head on his arm
            far into the depth of the table, so that the table can also be considered a cover for his face. Some lean on their watches and use them as a
            separation, though there is no reason for this, since a watch cannot cover one's face. Even according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> it is not
            considered to be a separation due to its small size. On the contrary, the kabbalists maintain that one must not lean on the palm of his hand at
            all, for on it are recorded all of his sins (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 131:47; <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em>, note 34), and one's watch is close to his palm.
        </p>
        <p>
            See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 131, note 31, where he writes that according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, who maintains that the cover is intended
            to separate between one's face and the floor, it is not enough to rest one's forehead on his sleeve, for if he does, he will be facing the floor
            without a separation. Instead, one must cover his face with his arm. If there is a table there, he may lean his forehead on his arm and then the
table is considered a separation between his face and the floor. Further, according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, it is permissible to hold a            <em>siddur</em> between one's face and the ground which would effectively divide between them. Still, we learned that the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            rules that there is no need for a divider here; rather it is merely a continuation of a custom from the time that people actually bowed down on the
            floor. However, concerning a covering, it is, indeed, proper that the main part of one's face be covered.

The <em>Roke'ach</em> 324 writes that <em>Nefillat Apayim </em>is only performed in a place where there is a Torah scroll, but the            <em>Beit Yosef</em> questions his words. The <em>Chida</em> concludes from this that it is the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> that one may
            fall on his face even in a place where there is no Torah scroll. (In practice, however, many <em>Sephardim</em> are accustomed to not falling on
            their faces at all.) The <em>Rama</em> 131:2 rules like the <em>Roke'ach</em>. In the rooms adjacent to the synagogue, if the <em>aron kodesh</em>
            can be seen, one falls on his face (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13). Even <em>sifrei kodesh</em> can be considered like a Torah scroll according to
            the majority of <em>Acharonim</em>, as written in <em>Siddur Olat Ra'ayah </em> p. 302, paragraph 4.

            city of Jerusalem, as is written in <em>Siddur Olat Ra'ayah</em> p. 302. Since we learned that there are <em>poskim</em> who completely disagree
            with the <em>Roke'ach</em>, and according to them there is no need for a Torah scroll at all, in every case of uncertainty concerning this law, it
            is permissible to follow those who maintain that one may fall on his face, especially since that is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em>.

See earlier in this book in the laws of the wordings and the customs of the different ethnic groups, 6:5. The <em>Igrot Moshe</em>            <em>Orach Chaim</em> 4:34 advises that one who is accustomed to saying <em>Vidui</em> but prays in a place in which it is not said, says it without
            beating his chest, so that it will not be noticeable. In a place where people praying with different wordings (<em>nusachim</em>) pray together, it
            is best they follow the custom of the <em>chazan</em>. Nevertheless, those who wish to say <em>Vidui</em> are permitted to beat their chest, for
            there is no concern of "<em>Lo Titgodedu</em>" (fragmenting the nation into divergent groups with different practices) or causing dissension,
            because everyone knows that concerning <em>Vidui</em> there are various customs. However, one must calculate the time in such a way that he will
succeed in finishing <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> before <em>Kaddish</em>, because after <em>Kaddish</em>, he will have to continue on to say            <em>Ashrei</em> with the congregation.

            Some <em>poskim</em> disagree and maintain that <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited the whole day of the wedding. However, the primary opinion is that
it is recited, for many are accustomed to fasting on that day. That is what the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:21 implies and what            <em>Yabia Omer</em> 3:11-12 writes as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>On the eighth day</strong>
, as long as seven consecutive 24-hour days have not passed from the wedding ceremony, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited, as written in<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 131:26, <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 131:21, and <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 22. However, regarding the recital of            <em>sheva berachot</em>, we go according to the days, and someone who got married before sunset already finishes his first day after sunset. This
            is because with regard to uncertainty concerning <em>berachot</em>, we are lenient (<em>safek berachot l'hakel</em>), whereas concerning the matter
            of <em>Tachanun</em>, we follow seven full 24-hour days.

            Even if the <em>brit</em> will be conducted at <em>Minchah</em> time, <em>Tachanun</em> is omitted there in <em>Shacharit</em> as well.
            Additionally, even when there are a number of <em>minyanim</em> for <em>Shacharit</em>, <em>Tachanun</em> is not recited in any of them. (In the
past, there was a custom that on the day of a <em>brit</em>, the whole community where the <em>brit</em> was taking place did not recite            <em>Tachanun</em>, and perhaps even today it is proper to practice that way in relatively small and close-knit communities, where everyone shares
in the joyous occasion.) If the <em>brit</em> is conducted in the morning, some have the <em>minhag</em> to recite <em>Tachanun</em> at            <em>Minchah</em> (<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 131:17, note 103) and some have the custom not to (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 131:27-29).

            See the sources brought by <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 131:24 and in the notes there. As a rule, in all the cases of uncertainty mentioned, those who
pray in <em>Nusach Sephard</em> (<em>Sephardim</em> and <em>Chassidim</em>) tend not to recite <em>Tachanun</em>, whereas those who pray in<em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> have more of a tendency to say <em>Tachanun</em>, as is written, for example, in <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 25:26 concerning            <em>pidyon haben</em>.

            Many <em>poskim </em>outspokenly argued against the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Chassidim</em> not to recite <em>Tachanun</em> on the days of the
            passing of prominent Jews. <em>Rav Feinstein</em> and <em>Yabia Omer</em> 3:11 taught that one who prays in such a <em>minyan</em> is obligated to
recite <em>Tachanun</em>, and he should not concern himself with <em>yohara</em> (arrogance) or "<em>Lo Titgodedu</em>." However, the<em>Beit Baruch</em> 32:191 writes that it is preferable not to separate oneself from the congregation. Regarding the rulings of the Chassidic            <em>poskim</em>, see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 131:24.
