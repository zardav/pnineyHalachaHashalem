    Chapter 30 - Teĥum Shabbat

<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. General Principles of <em>Teĥum Shabbat </em>
</h2>
<p>
    The need to travel from place to place stems from man’s deficiency: he
    cannot find his livelihood and meet his needs by remaining stationary. So
    he must roam and leave his place. But the idea of Shabbat is for every Jew
    to rest from his travails and worries, contemplate the inner perfection of
    creation, thank God for choosing Israel from all peoples and giving us His
    Torah, and delight in God and His goodness.
</p>
<p>
    For this reason, the Sages ordained boundaries (<em>teĥumin</em>) within
which one may walk on Shabbat, and beyond which one may not walk. One’s<em>teĥum Shabbat</em> (Shabbat boundary) is determined by his    <em>mekom shevita</em> - the place where he is spending Shabbat (literally
"stopping place") - plus 2,000 <em>amot</em> in each direction (2,000    <em>amot</em> corresponds to 2,000 steps of an average person,
    approximately 912 m).

</p>
<p>
If one is spending Shabbat in a field (i.e., not in a city or town), his    <em>mekom shevita</em> is defined as four <em>amot </em>squared. This is
    the amount of space one occupies when lying on the ground with his arms and
    legs outstretched.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    He may walk 2,000 <em>amot</em> beyond that in each direction. If he is
    spending Shabbat in a city or town, the entire settled area is considered
    one place, and he may travel 2,000 <em>amot</em> beyond the city limits
    (see section 8 below).
</p>
<p>
    According to Rambam and <em>Smag</em>, <em>teĥum Shabbat </em>restrictions
    are based on Torah law, though the Torah prohibition forbids one to travel
    more than twelve <em>mil</em> (24,000 <em>amot</em>, which is 10944 m,
    almost eleven km) from his <em>mekom shevita</em>. This is based on the
    size of the Israelite camp in the wilderness, as the Torah states: "Let
    everyone remain where he is; let no man leave his place on the seventh day"
    (Shemot 16:29). However, according to Ramban, Rosh, Rashba, and most
    Rishonim, this verse does not refer to the laws of <em>teĥum</em> but
    rather to those of carrying in a <em>reshut ha-rabim</em>; all boundary
    restrictions (even beyond twelve <em>mil</em>) are rabbinic law.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    The Sages ordained that if one must travel beyond the <em>teĥum</em> on
    Shabbat - in order to attend a wedding celebration or a Torah lecture - he
    may make an <em>eruv teĥumin</em>, which extends his <em>teĥum </em>in the
    necessary direction (as explained below in sections 12-14). One who leaves
his <em>teĥum</em> forfeits it and must remain within his four    <em>amot</em> (as explained below, section 11).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. Squaring the <em>Teĥum</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages established that one’s <em>mekom shevita </em>on Shabbat is
    square, and thus his <em>teĥum</em> is square as well. This means that if
    he is spending Shabbat in a field, and his <em>mekom shevita</em> is thus
    four <em>amot</em>, the measurement is not made by drawing a circle around
him with a diameter of four <em>amot</em>. Rather, to determine his<em>mekom shevita</em> we inscribe such a circle in a square with four-    <em>ama</em> sides along the four cardinal directions, which adds space to
his <em>mekom shevita </em>at the corners. Similarly, if one’s    <em>mekom shevita</em> is in a city or town, even if the area is round, we
inscribe it in a square or rectangle, adding space at the corners (    <em>m.</em> <em>Eruvin</em> 53a).
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_1.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_2.png"/>
<p>
    Then 2,000 <em>amot</em> are measured in each direction. Once again we draw
    a square or rectangle, which once again grants him additional space in the
    corners.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_3.png"/>

<p>
    This rule, that we square off the city, is derived from the Torah’s
    description of the area the Levites were given outside each of their
    cities:
</p>
<p>
    You shall measure off two thousand <em>amot</em> outside the city wall all
    around. You shall measure off two thousand <em>amot</em> outside the town
    on the east side (lit. corner; same applies to the other directions), two
    thousand on the south side, two thousand on the west side, and two thousand
    on the north side, with the city in the center. (Bamidbar 35:5)
</p>
<p>
    The most straightforward explanation for why we square the <em>teĥum</em>
    is that it is extremely difficult to measure and mark off a circular
    boundary. One would need to measure 2,000 <em>amot</em> from almost each
    and every point of the city’s perimeter. In contrast, when marking off a
    square boundary, only four measurements need to be made - one in each of
    the four cardinal directions. After that, a straight line can be drawn in
    each direction, and the result is the <em>teĥum</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, this method reflects a spiritual reality. A circle represents
    the infinite, which has no beginning and no end. A person’s life is
    circular and cyclical. His actions, wishes, and thoughts repeat themselves
    cyclically. Even his limbs are circular and cylindrical. This makes it
    difficult for a person to realize his aspirations. The way to solve the
    problem is to take one’s "circular" infinite ideas, and give them a
    "square" finite framework that will help him put them into practice. This
    is the meaning of <em>teĥum Shabbat</em>, which is meant to provide a
    framework for absorbing the holiness and blessing of Shabbat. This is why
    each city belonging to the Levites, who are charged with revealing faith in
    this world, is surrounded by a square boundary.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. <em>Teĥum Shabbat</em> Is Individual
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Teĥum Shabbat</em>
    is specific to every individual, based on his location. For example, let us
    say that the homes of two neighbors (who do not live in a city) are located
1,000 <em>amot</em> apart from each other. Each neighbor has his own<em>teĥum Shabbat</em>, part of which overlaps with his neighbor’s    <em>teĥum Shabbat</em>, and part of which does not.
</p>
<p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_4.png"/>
    The laws of <em>teĥumin</em> apply to one’s animals and belongings, and to
Jews as well as non-Jews (see n, 12 below). Therefore, if one carried his    <em>talit</em> to the edge of his <em>teĥum</em>, and his friend wants to
borrow it but has a different <em>teĥum</em>, the friend may not carry the<em>talit</em> beyond its owner’s <em>teĥum</em> (SA 397:3). If the<em>talit</em> is jointly owned, it may be carried only where their    <em>teĥumin</em> overlap (<em>ibid</em>., 397:9).
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_5.png"/>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Spending Shabbat In or Outside a City
</h2>
<p>
    For someone who is spending Shabbat in a city or town, whether its
    residents are Jewish or non-Jewish, the whole area that is built up
contiguously is considered one place, and the 2,000 <em>amot</em> of the    <em>teĥum</em> are measured from its perimeter. Even if there is space
between the homes, as long as they are surrounded by a fence or an    <em>eruv</em>, the entire enclosed area is considered one place, and the
    2,000 <em>amot</em> are measured from its perimeter (as will be explained
    in section 8).
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_6.png"/>
<p>
    All this pertains to one who spends Shabbat in the city or within its
    squared-off area. However, one who spends Shabbat in a field near the city
is limited to 2,000 <em>amot</em> in each direction, and if his 2,000    <em>amot</em> terminate inside a city, his <em>teĥum</em> ends right there,
in the middle of the city. We do not consider the whole city his four    <em>amot</em>.

</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. Measuring <em>Teĥum</em> in Rabbinic Times and Nowadays
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages established rules for measuring the <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> as
    precisely as possible. First, they declared: "<em>Teĥum Shabbat</em> may be
    measured only with a rope that is fifty <em>amot</em> long, no more or
    less" (<em>Eruvin</em> 57b). If a longer rope were used, its weight would
    make it hard to pull taut, and the resulting measurement would be too
    short. If a shorter rope were used, one might pull it too tight, and the
    resulting measurement would be too long. Second, they required those
    measuring to hold the rope at chest height. If the person holding one end
    of the rope were to hold it at head level, while the person at the other
    end were to hold it at foot level, the resulting measurement would be too
    short (SA 399:1-3). Third, they said that when measuring an area that
    contains a valley, one person should stand on either side of the valley, so
    that they can measure the distance in the air. When measuring an area that
    contains a hill, tall poles should be set up so that the rope stretches
    above the hill. If the valley or hill is more than fifty <em>amot</em>
    wide, thus making it impossible to use a fifty-<em>ama</em> rope, the area
    should be measured with a four-<em>ama</em> rope. The person standing above
    should hold the rope at foot level, and the person standing below should
    hold it at chest level. If the slope is so steep that it would be difficult
    to calculate the measurement this way, the measurement should be estimated.
If the area contains a cliff, as long as the cliff is less than four    <em>amot</em> wide, it is not taken into account at all (<em>Eruvin</em>
    58a-b; SA 399:4-5).
</p>
<p>
    The Sages added that for these measurements, we rely only on an expert who
    knows how to calculate distances properly. If two experts arrive at
different measurements, we follow the measurement that results in a larger    <em>teĥum</em>. Since the laws of <em>teĥum</em> are rabbinic, we follow
    the more lenient opinion (<em>Eruvin</em> 58b-59a; SA 399:7-9). If one
    happens to spend Shabbat in a place where <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> has not
    been calculated, and he needs to go somewhere for the sake of a mitzva, he
may take 2,000 medium-sized strides, which is approximately 2,000    <em>amot </em>(<em>Eruvin</em> 42a; SA 397:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 5).
</p>
<p>
    Today it is best to establish <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> using aerial maps or
    GPS devices, as these can measure distances with extreme precision. We
    should not insist on measuring in the way that the Sages established. After
    all, their whole purpose was to measure as precisely as possible, using the
    tools available to them, without terribly inconveniencing those charged
    with measuring. Now that we have methods of measuring that are both more
    precise and more convenient, we must take advantage of them.
</p>

    6. The Cardinal Directions and Squaring a City
</h2>
<p>
    As we have seen (section 2), we square a person’s <em>mekom shevita</em> to
    determine his <em>teĥum</em>. If he is in a field (i.e., not in a city or
    town), his <em>mekom shevita</em> is a square with four-<em>ama</em> sides;
    if he is in a city, we inscribe the city in a square. From this square we
    measure 2,000 <em>amot</em> in each direction.
</p>
<p>
    Let us add now that when we square the city, we do so based on the four
    cardinal directions (SA 398:3).
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    If the city already has corners that lend themselves to squaring in a way
    that does not follow the four cardinal directions, the squaring is done
    accordingly (SA 398:1).
</p>
<p>
    Examples of squaring based on the four cardinal directions:
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_8.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_9.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_10.png"/>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Examples in which it is agreed that the squaring does not follow the four
    cardinal directions:
</p>
<p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_11.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_12.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_13.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    When a city’s shape lends itself to squaring that does not correspond to
    the four cardinal directions, the <em>poskim</em> disagree how to square
    it. Some maintain that only when there is a compelling reason not to follow
    the four cardinal directions may one follow the layout of the city (SAH
    398:3; <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 76:14). However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain
    that if the shape of a city clearly lends itself to squaring in a certain
    way, we follow this squaring even though it does not correspond to the four
    cardinal directions (see n. 7). In cases of doubt, the local rabbinate or
    rabbinic authority should make the decision.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of such intermediate cases in which a city’s shape clearly lends
    itself to squaring in a direction other than the four cardinal directions
    include cases where one side of the city is straight from one end of the
    city to the other (figure 1) and cases where the perimeter of the city
    contains a right angle (figure 2, in which case we follow the directions of
    the right angle and not the four cardinal directions).

    <br clear="ALL"/>
    It is important to note that if one is spending Shabbat outside a city and
    his <em>mekom shevita</em> is limited to four <em>amot </em>square, he may
    choose to square his <em>mekom shevita </em>in whatever direction he
wishes, and this will also determine how his 2,000-<em>ama</em>    <em>teĥum</em> is squared (see section 12 below).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Cases In Which We Do Not Square a City
</h2>
<p>
As we have seen, by squaring the city, we add space in the corners to the    <em>teĥum</em>. However, the Sages pointed out that sometimes we cannot
    draw straight lines to square the whole city, because the resulting square
    would include uninhabited areas that are too large to be considered
    subsumed by the city. Examples of this would be cities that are shaped like
a bow or like an L. The operative principle is that if there are 4,000    <em>amot</em> between the two ends of the shape, that part of the city
    cannot be squared.
</p>
<p>
    An L-shaped city:
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_16.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_17.png"/>
<p>
    A bow-shaped city:

</p>

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_18.png"/>

<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. Connecting Settled Areas
</h2>
<p>
    As long as the houses in a city are contiguous, meaning that they are not
    farther away from one another than the size of a <em>karpif</em> (a large
    courtyard, approximately 32 m long), they are considered part of one area
    for the purpose of assessing the <em>teĥum</em>. If they are separated from
    one another by more space than that, they are not considered part of one
    area, and each house’s <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> is then calculated
    separately.
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    If the houses in a city are contiguous, then even if one house is out of
alignment, as long as it is not more than 32 m from the next house, the    <em>teĥum</em>’s<em> </em>square or rectangle expands to include the
unaligned house. If there are additional houses after this one, the    <em>teĥum</em> expands to include them as well; this can continue even if
    it means that the <em>teĥum</em> extends outside the city proper for a
    distance that would take days to walk. As long as each house is not
    separated from the next by more than 32 m, the <em>teĥum </em>extends to
    include them. However, if a house is more than 32 m away, it is not
    included within the rectangle.
</p>

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_19.png"/>
<p>
    If the distance between two adjacent neighborhoods is greater than the size
    of two large courtyards (i.e., over 64 m), then each neighborhood is
    considered a town in its own right. We square each on its own, and then
    2,000 <em>amot</em> are measured in each direction from that square. In
    contrast, if the distance separating the two neighborhoods is 64 m or less,
    they are considered one area and we square them together. There must be at
    least fifty residents living in an area for a group of houses to be defined
    as a neighborhood (<em>Eruvin</em> 60a). Even if there are fewer than fifty
    people, as long as the area contains three courtyards, each of which joins
    two homes together, or six homes, each of which has a courtyard, the area
    is still considered a neighborhood (MB 398:38; <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> OĤ
    110:19).
</p>
<p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_20.png"/>

    If an area is enclosed by a wall or an <em>eruv</em>, all its homes and
neighborhoods are considered one area. This is true even when the wall or    <em>eruv</em> is farther than a <em>karpif</em>’s length from the last
    house, and even if there is a large distance between the homes and
    neighborhoods.
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_21.png"/>

<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. Overlapping Squares
</h2>
<p>
    When the squares or rectangles formed around two cities overlap, even when
    there is no joint <em>eruv</em>, the overlapping area connects the cities.
    We draw a new rectangle around the entire area to include both cities. The
    residents of both cities may then walk 2,000 <em>amot</em> beyond the joint
    rectangle.
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_22.png"/>
<p>
    However, if the distance separating the corners of the two rectangles is
    greater than 4,000 <em>amot,</em> as we have seen (section 7), we do not
square the entire area. Rather, each city is assigned a standard    <em>teĥum</em> of 2,000 <em>amot</em> beyond its rectangle in each
    direction.
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_23.png"/>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. The Status of Large Cities
</h2>
<p>
    If a highway within a city is more than 64 m wide and bisects the entire
city, then the city is viewed as divided in two, and the    <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> for residents of each of the two sections is
    calculated separately. This is also the case for a wide-open area such as a
    park or large garden.
</p>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_24.png"/>
<p>
	If it is more than 64 m wide and bisects the entire
city, then the city is viewed as divided in two, and the    <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> for each of the two sections is calculated
    separately.
</p>
<p>
    At first glance, it would seem that the Ayalon Highway divides Tel Aviv
    into two cities. Nevertheless, since there is an <em>eruv</em> that
    encompasses all of Tel Aviv and the nearby cities, the <em>eruv</em> unites
    the different sections. Additionally, if a highway bisects a city but the
    rectangles drawn around each section overlap, then the overlapping area
    joins together the sections and we draw a new rectangle around the entire
    area, as explained above. Additionally, one could argue that since it is intended that all a city’s residents will make use
    of a highway, park, or large garden, they are considered part of the city
    and do not actually divide it.
</p>

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/shabat_30_25.png"/>
<p>
    Others disagree, maintaining that these factors - an <em>eruv</em>, usage
    by all city residents, and overlapping rectangles - cannot join together
    the two sections formed by a highway or park that bisects a city. The
    primary position is the lenient one. However, it is proper to be stringent
    and avoid walking more than twelve <em>mil</em> beyond the highway, since
    some say that traveling beyond twelve <em>mil</em> is forbidden by Torah
    law (see section 1 above).

11. Traveling Beyond the <em>Teĥum</em> and Items Arriving from Beyond the    <em>Teĥum</em>
</h2>
<p>
    One who traveled beyond the boundaries of the <em>teĥum</em>, whether
    knowingly or unknowingly, forfeits his 2,000 <em>amot</em> and may now only
    move within his four <em>amot</em> (SA 405:1; n. 1 above). Should he need
    to move his bowels, he may walk to a place where he will be able do so
    privately. Afterward, he may distance himself from this place enough to
    avoid the foul smell, so that he may recite prayers and <em>berakhot</em>,
    but he may not move more than four <em>amot</em> from that spot (SA 406:1).
</p>
<p>
    One who traveled beyond the <em>teĥum</em> knowingly and reached an area
enclosed by a wall or <em>eruv</em> is nonetheless limited to his four    <em>amot</em>. Even if he is now inside a house, he may not move more than
    four <em>amot</em>. In contrast, if he traveled beyond the <em>teĥum </em>
    unknowingly or under duress, he may walk freely within the enclosed area
    (SA 405:6; BHL s.v. "aval").
</p>
<p>
    If one traveled beyond the <em>teĥum</em> in order to save a life, the
Sages ordained that upon completing his mission, he may walk 2,000    <em>amot</em> in each direction. If this new <em>teĥum</em> overlaps his
original <em>teĥum</em>, he may return home, and he retains his original    <em>teĥum</em> as though he never left (<em>Eruvin</em> 44b). In certain
cases he may even return to his original place regardless of    <em>teĥumin</em>, as explained above in 27:10 and n. 12).
</p>
<p>
    If one is traveling on a plane that, due to unforeseen circumstances, lands
    in an airport on Shabbat, his <em>teĥum</em> <em>Shabbat</em> is
established upon his landing, and he may not go farther than 2,000    <em>amot</em> in any direction.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
    Since an airport is generally surrounded by a fence and often contains an
    area for sleeping, the whole airport is considered his four <em>amot</em>,
    and he can walk another 2,000 <em>amot </em>beyond it. However, if the
    airport is not surrounded by a fence, then his <em>mekom shevita</em> is
    established the moment the plane touches down. If the plane then taxies on
the runway for another 2,000 <em>amot</em>, he has gone beyond his    <em>teĥum</em>, and he may not move any farther than his four <em>amot</em>
    . This means he must remain on the plane until Shabbat ends. If the crew or
    security personnel insist that he leave, or if he needs to leave in order
    to use the bathroom, he may do so. If he then reaches an enclosed area, he
    may move around within it, since the only reason he originally traveled
    beyond his <em>teĥum</em> is that he was forced to do so (SA 405:6). If his
    flight was for the sake of a mitzva, then even if the plane taxies for a
full kilometer and the airport is not fenced in, he may still walk 2,000    <em>amot</em> from the airplane door (SA 248:4; MB <em>ad loc. </em>32).
</p>
<p>
One whose boat docked on Shabbat may leave the boat and walk 2,000    <em>amot</em> in each direction. This is because until reaching the port,
the boat was more than ten <em>tefaĥim</em> above the ocean floor, so    <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> did not apply to it. Only once he sets foot on dry
    land is his <em>teĥum</em> established. If the port is fenced in, he may
    walk 2,000 <em>amot</em> beyond the enclosure (SA 404:1; n. 3 above).
</p>
<p>
One who traveled beyond his <em>teĥum</em> and then returned inside his    <em>teĥum</em> unknowingly or due to circumstances beyond his control may
    still walk within his <em>teĥum</em> (SA 406:1). However, if he traveled
    beyond the <em>teĥum </em>knowingly, then even if he returned unknowingly,
    he forfeits his <em>teĥum</em>, though he may still walk throughout the
    city (SA 405:8).
</p>
<p>
    Just as one may not travel beyond his <em>teĥum</em> on Shabbat, he also
    may not move his possessions outside the <em>teĥum</em>. If he took fruit
    beyond the <em>teĥum </em>unknowingly, even though they may not be carried
    more than four <em>amot</em>, they may be eaten. If he did so knowingly,
    the fruit may not be eaten (SA 405:9; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 52; see above,
    ch. 26 n. 6).
</p>
<p>
    If a non-Jew brought fruit from outside the <em>teĥum</em> on Shabbat, as
    long as he brought them for himself or for another non-Jew, a Jew may eat
    the fruit. However, one may not carry them more than four <em>amot</em>. If
    the non-Jew brought the fruit into a home or a site that is enclosed by a
    fence or an <em>eruv</em>, one may carry the fruit within the enclosed
    area. In contrast, if the non-Jew brought the fruit for a Jew, that Jew and
    the members of his household may not eat the fruit until enough time has
    passed after Shabbat for the fruit to have been brought then (SA 325:8).

    12. <em>Eruv Teĥumin</em>
</h2>
<p>
If one wants to walk on Shabbat to a place that lies beyond his<em>teĥum</em>, he can render it permissible by making an<em>eruv teĥumin</em> before Shabbat, that is, by establishing his    <em>mekom shevita </em>at the place where he puts the <em>eruv</em>. By
    placing this <em>eruv</em>,<em> </em>he merges the old <em>teĥum</em>
(which would not have allowed him to go where he wants) with the new    <em>teĥum</em> (which will allow him to go there) - this is why it is
    called an <em>eruv </em>(which literally means "merging")<em> teĥumin</em>.
    However, the distance that the <em>eruv teĥumin</em> affords him in one
direction is lost in the opposite direction. For example, if one places the    <em>eruv</em> <em>teĥumin</em> 2,000 <em>amot</em> to the east of his home,
    he may now walk 4,000 <em>amot</em> eastward (2,000 <em>amot</em> from his
    home to the <em>eruv</em> and 2,000 <em>amot</em> beyond the <em>eruv</em>
    ), but he may no longer walk westward at all.

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_26.png"/>
<img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/e_shabat_30_27.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    There are two ways to shift one’s <em>mekom shevita</em>. The first is by
    simply walking 2,000 <em>amot</em> in the desired direction before Shabbat
    begins and staying there for the onset of Shabbat. As long as one is there
    during the entire period of <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, that becomes his
    place, and his <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> is now calculated from that point. He
    does not need to verbalize anything for this to take effect. It is enough
    for him to intend to establish his <em>teĥum</em> from that point. In
    contrast, if one is hiking in a field during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> but
does not intend to establish his <em>mekom shevita</em> there, his    <em>mekom shevita</em> remains his home (SA 409:7; MB <em>ad loc. </em>29).
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p>
    The second way is to set aside two meals’ worth of food at that place and
    recite the declaration for making an <em>eruv teĥumin</em>,<em> </em>along
with a <em>berakha</em>, as will be explained in the next section. An    <em>eruv</em> <em>teĥumin</em> should be made only for the purpose of a
    mitzva - for example in order to attend a Torah lecture or a mitzva
    celebration. If one makes an <em>eruv teĥumin </em>for some other purpose,
    it is still effective <em>be-di’avad</em> (SA 415:1).
</p>
<p>
When making an <em>eruv teĥumin</em>, one must place it within 2,000<em>amot</em> of his home. This way his home will be within the    <em>teĥum</em> of the <em>eruv</em>, and he may then walk from his home to
the <em>eruv</em>. If his home is outside the <em>eruv</em>’s    <em> teĥum</em>, the <em>eruv</em> is ineffective, and his <em>teĥum</em>
    is measured from his home.
    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
</p>
<p>
    One can actually use an <em>eruv teĥumin</em> to travel 5,600 <em>amot</em>
    ,<em> </em>not just 4,000 <em>amot</em>. Since the <em>mekom shevita</em>
    where he sets aside the <em>eruv</em> is temporary (unlike a city, as above
    in section 6), he may have in mind for the new <em>teĥum</em> created by
    the <em>eruv</em> to be oriented so that the square’s diagonal faces his
    desired direction. He thus gains the additional corners.

    13. Placing the <em>Eruv Teĥumin</em> and Reciting the <em>Berakha</em>
</h2>
<p>
    One who wishes to make an <em>eruv</em> by placing food must set aside two
    meals’ worth of food. If bread is used, it must amount to the volume of six
    eggs, which is approximately 300 ml. (Others maintain that it must amount
    to the volume of eight eggs.) If one wishes to use food that is eaten
    together with bread, it is sufficient to use the amount of that food that
    would normally be spread on or eaten together with six eggs’ volume of
    bread (SA 409:7). If the <em>eruv</em> is meant to serve several people,
    two meals’ worth of food must be left for each person. If a large number of
people are involved and one would like to minimize the bulkiness of the    <em>eruv</em>, he may use olive oil, chocolate spread, or peanut butter, as
    relatively small quantities of these foods are used with a large amount of
    bread. One may also use a <em>revi’it</em> (75 ml) of vinegar, which is
    enough to use as a dip or dressing for two meals’ worth of vegetables (MB
    386:35; 409:36). Drinks may also be used for the <em>eruv</em> as long as
    there are two <em>revi’iyot</em> (150 ml) per person (SA 386:6). Salt and
    water may not be used for the <em>eruv</em> (<em>Eruvin</em> 26a).
    <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
</p>
<p>
The food must belong to the person who plans to make use of the    <em>eruv</em>, as he uses this food to establish his <em>mekom shevita</em>
    . When the <em>eruv</em> is meant for several people, the food’s owner must
    arrange for each person to acquire some of the food, making all of them
    partners in it. This is accomplished by means of third person, who lifts up
    the food with the intent to acquire it on behalf of all those who need to
    use the <em>eruv</em> (SA 413:1).
</p>
<p>
If the food set aside for the <em>eruv</em> was eaten before<em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, the <em>eruv</em> is ineffective. However, after    <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> the <em>eruv</em> may be eaten, because once one
    has established his <em>mekom shevita</em> during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>
, it remains in effect for all of Shabbat (Rema 394:2). If the<em>eruv</em> was left in a place where it could not be accessed during    <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> without transgressing a Torah law (for example,
if a boulder would need to be rolled away to retrieve it), the    <em>eruv</em> is ineffective (SA 394:3; 409:3-4).
</p>
<p>
When setting aside the <em>eruv</em>, one should recite the following    <em>berakha</em>: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who
    sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us regarding the
mitzva of <em>eruv</em>" ("    <em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu al mitzvat eruv</em>"). One
    should follow this with the declaration: "With this <em>eruv</em> it shall
    be permitted to me to walk 2,000 <em>amot</em> from this place in every
direction." <em>Bedi’avad</em>, even if he simply said: "This shall be an    <em>eruv</em>," it is effective. But if he said nothing at all, he has not
    established an <em>eruv</em> (SA 415:4; MB <em>ad loc. </em>15).
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>eruv</em> is meant to serve several people, their names should
    be explicitly mentioned as part of the declaration. One must also take care
    that the <em>eruv</em> contains two meals’ worth of food for each person
    who needs to rely on it (SA 415:4). If he would like the <em>eruv</em> to
    be effective for multiple <em>Shabbatot</em>, he should add at the end of
    the declaration the phrase "for all <em>Shabbatot</em> of the year." Then,
as long as the <em>eruv</em> remains in existence, it is effective (MB    <em>ad loc. </em>16).
</p>
<p>
    An <em>eruv </em>may be placed by a <em>shali’aĥ </em>(emissary or proxy).
However, a minor, a non-Jew, or one who does not believe in the mitzva of    <em>eruv</em> cannot serve as a <em>shali’aĥ</em>. The <em>shali’aĥ</em>
    must recite the <em>berakha</em> and the declaration. If he said nothing,
    the <em>eruv</em> is not effective (SA 409:8). However, it is effective if
the owner of the <em>eruv</em> declares: "With the <em>eruv</em> that my<em>shali’aĥ</em> is setting aside, I will be permitted to walk 2,000    <em>amot</em> from the <em>eruv</em> in every direction" (BHL s.v.
    "ve-yomar").
</p>
<p>
    One cannot place an <em>eruv</em> on behalf of another without the other
    person’s knowledge. One may place an <em>eruv</em> for his minor children,
    and the <em>teĥum</em> that it establishes is binding for them. Similarly,
    one may place an <em>eruv</em> for members of his household who are over
    the age of bar or bat mitzva<em>. </em>However<em>,</em> if upon hearing
    that there is an <em>eruv</em> <em>teĥumin</em> they object and state that
    they do not want it, the <em>teĥum</em> that it establishes is not binding
    for them. A child who is under the age of six is considered secondary to
    his mother, so an <em>eruv</em> that is effective for the mother is
    effective for her child as well (SA 414:1-2).
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>
    14. Establishing a Conditional <em>Eruv</em> for All Local Residents
</h2>
<p>
    One may place an <em>eruv </em>conditionally. For example, if one knows
    that on Shabbat two Torah scholars will be lecturing in two nearby towns,
    but he has yet to decide if he will attend the lecture to the east, the one
    to the west, or neither, he places one <em>eruv</em> in the east and one in
the west and stipulates in his mind that on Shabbat he will decide which    <em>teĥum</em> to use, the one based on his home, on the <em>eruv</em> in
    the west, or on the <em>eruv</em> in the east. Once he has made his
    decision, though, he is bound by his chosen <em>teĥum</em>. If he did not
    make a conscious decision but merely started walking in accordance with
only one specific <em>teĥum</em>, he has thus established his    <em>teĥum</em> and may no longer change his mind and walk in accordance
with a different <em>teĥum</em> (<em>Eruvin</em> 82a; SA 413:1; MB    <em>ad loc</em>. 8).
    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p>
    One may volunteer to place an <em>eruv</em> on behalf of all residents of a
    locale. He then declares: "With this <em>eruv</em> it shall be permitted
    for all local residents and their guests to walk 2,000 <em>amot</em> from
    this place in every direction." Anyone who is aware of the existence of
    this <em>eruv</em> before Shabbat, even if he did not decide that the site
    of the <em>eruv </em>is his <em>mekom shevita</em>, may decide on Shabbat
that he wishes to walk in that direction and may rely on the communal    <em>eruv</em>. However, one who was unaware of the <em>eruv</em>’s
    existence before Shabbat may not rely on it (SA 413:1).
</p>
<p>
If there are so many local residents that the person placing the    <em>eruv</em> cannot leave two meals’ worth of food for each one of them,
    then as long as he knows that there will be no more than twenty people who
    will want to rely on the <em>eruv</em>, he may place two meals’ worth of
    food for twenty people and declare: "With this <em>eruv</em> it shall be
    permissible for anyone who wishes to walk 2,000 <em>amot</em> from this
    place in every direction for all <em>Shabbatot</em> of the year." This
    allows all who are interested in relying upon his <em>eruv</em> to do so,
    on condition that they are aware of its existence before the Shabbat they
    rely on it (SA 413:1; BHL s.v. "le-khol eĥad"). It seems that when it is
    clear that someone will make use of the <em>eruv</em>, the <em>berakha</em>
    should be recited, but when it is uncertain whether anyone will make use of
    it, no <em>berakha</em> should be recited.
</p>
<p>
    If one places an <em>eruv</em> unconditionally, his <em>teĥum</em> is
    determined by the location of the <em>eruv</em>. He may not change his mind
    and follow the <em>teĥum</em> measured from his home.

            According to R. Ĥayim Naeh’s calculations, which are based on
Rambam (with whom the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> agree), one            <em>ama</em> is 48 cm, and 2,000 <em>amot</em> is 960 m. According
            to Ĥazon Ish, one <em>ama</em> is 57.6 cm, and 2,000 <em>amot</em>
            is 1152 m. Since it has been ascertained that the Turkish dirhem
            with which R. Naeh was familiar is larger than the dirhem used in
            Rambam’s time, we should follow the more accurate calculation even
though it results in a stringency. (Additionally, the<em>shi’urim</em> of volume need to be in sync with the            <em>shi’urim</em> of distance, since the Sages said that the volume
            of forty <em>se’ah</em> can fit into an area of one <em>ama</em> by
one <em>ama</em> by three <em>amot</em>.) Therefore, R. Ĥayim            <em> </em>Beinish writes in <em>Midot Ve-shi’urei Torah </em>5:24
that according to Rambam, one <em>ama</em> is 45.6 cm and 2,000            <em>amot</em> is 912 m. In addition, the actual length of the
            average man’s forearm (<em>ama</em>)<em> </em>is approximately 45
            cm. See <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot</em>, ch. 10 n. 11.
            This is how we present every halakhic measurement. See above, ch.
            29 n. 1.

According to SA 396:1, one’s "place" is four <em>amot</em> by four<em>amot</em>, as it is with regard to carrying in a            <em>reshut ha-rabim </em>or a <em>karmelit</em>. Rema writes that
            some maintain for the purposes of <em>teĥumin</em>, one’s place
            extends four <em>amot</em> from the center in each direction, for a

            The Sages were uncertain whether boundary restrictions apply above
            ten <em>tefaĥim</em>; perhaps, since people do not walk there, the
            prohibition does not apply there. In practice, when there is
            uncertainty pertaining to a rabbinic prohibition, the law follows
            the more lenient position. Therefore, regarding boat travel in
            oceans and rivers, where Rambam agrees that the prohibition is not
            a Torah prohibition (as such travel is not comparable to travel in
            the wilderness), as long as one is ten <em>tefaĥim</em> above the
seabed, the <em>teĥum</em> prohibitions do not apply (<em>Eruvin</em> 43a; SA 404:1). According to SA 248:2, the ten            <em>tefaĥim</em> above the seabed are measured from the bottom of
            the boat, while according to R. Eliezer of Metz they are measured
            from one’s feet. SAH and MB<em> </em>248:14 state that in times of
            need one may be lenient. However, if one is traveling at a height
of more than ten <em>tefaĥim</em> above land, several            <em>poskim</em> maintain that one should be stringent in accordance
            with Rambam and not travel more than twelve mil (Rema 404:1).

            When measuring 2,000 <em>amot</em> from a city or town, according
            to Rambam and SA 398:5, we measure from the outermost homes or from
the <em>eruv</em> (following the opinion of the Sages in            <em>Eruvin</em> 57a). According to Rosh and Rema, one first adds
            the equivalent area of a <em>karpif</em> (an enclosed courtyard in
front of the houses) to the city, which amounts to 70 2/3            <em>amot</em> (approximately 32 meters). This area is now
considered part of the city. From there we measure 2,000<em>amot</em> (following the opinion of R. Meir in the above            <em>gemara</em>; see MB 398:21 and BHL s.v. "ve-khen"). As
            explained in section 8 below, when there are two settled areas
            adjacent to each other, SA agrees to the <em>karpif</em> rule.

If a town is so small that the entire area is within his 2,000            <em>amot</em>, then the area of the town is skipped (the whole city

            continue from the far edge of the town (SA 408:1). Here is an

            The city’s residents may not decide to square the city in a way
            that does not follow the four cardinal directions just because they
            would like to add space in the corners in the direction they wish
            to go. This is because the law is unequivocal: the city must be
            squared in accordance with the four cardinal directions. This is
            based upon the procedure described for the Levite cities: "You
            shall measure off two thousand <em>amot</em> outside the city wall
            all around. You shall measure off two thousand <em>amot</em>
            outside the city on the east side, two thousand on the south side,
            two thousand on the west side, and two thousand on the north side,
            with the city in the center" (Bamidbar 35:5). We see that the verse
            follows the four cardinal directions. This understanding is implied
in MT 28:7 and SA<em> </em>398:3, and is also followed by MB            <em> </em>398:7 and <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 110:23. Some maintain that
            the city’s residents do have the right to decide to square their
            city in a way that does not correspond with the four cardinal
            directions. In such a case, every individual is bound by the
            group’s decision (Rabbeinu Yehonatan, <em>Eruvin</em> 16a, s.v.
            "im"; <em>Perisha</em> 398:1; <em>Mirkevet Ha-Mishneh</em>, Shabbat
            27:2; <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>,<em> Mahadura Tinyana</em>, OĤ 51).

            In the city featured in figure 1, most Rishonim and Aĥaronim rule
            that it is squared based on the right angle (as is the case with a
            city that is shaped like an L, according to Rashba, Ran, Ritva, and
            Me’iri). In the city featured in figure 2, one side of the entire
            city is a straight line. The law in such a case can be derived from
            the case of a city that is shaped like a bow (section 7), where it
is squared based on this straight line, or "bowstring" (Me’iri,            <em>Eruvin</em> 55a). Ĥazon Ish states this as well in OĤ 80 and
            110. Some maintain that in both the above cases, the city must be
squared based on the four cardinal directions (SAH 388:3;            <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 76:14). Others maintain that in all doubtful
            cases, the city is squared in whichever way will add the least area
            to the city (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 110:23). The <em>halakha</em>
            follows the first opinion, that of the majority of <em>poskim</em>,
            and the figures above reflect this opinion. Nevertheless, when it
            is not clear if the perimeter of a city contains a right angle, the
            local rabbinate or rabbinic authority may decide to rely on those
            who rule that such a city should be squared based on the four
            cardinal directions.

            Rambam and SA 388:4 state, in disagreement with this diagram, that
            the 2,000 <em>amot</em> are measured from the edges of the
            inhabited homes. The resulting <em>teĥum</em> follows the curve of
the bow. However, the diagram follows the opinion of            <em>Tosafot</em> (55b, s.v. "ve-im lav"), Rosh, most Rishonim, and
            Rema that for the inside of the bow, where the arc narrows to less
            than 4,000 <em>amot</em>, we draw a "bowstring" from one end of the
arc to the other and measure the <em>teĥum</em> as 2,000<em>amot</em> from that straight line (see diagram). The            <em>halakha</em> follows the majority of <em>poskim</em>,
especially since the laws of <em>teĥumin</em> are rabbinic, so the<em>halakha</em> follows the lenient position. Although<em>Tur</em> has an even more lenient opinion, the rest of the            <em>poskim</em> disagree, as detailed in BHL<em> </em>s.v. "ve-yesh
omrim." Uncertainty still remains regarding how to measure the            <em>teĥum</em> for the rest of the bow, where the arc widens to
            4,000 <em>amot </em>and greater. It would seem that we can follow
            the position of Rambam and SA that the <em>teĥum</em> follows the
            curve, as displayed in the diagram. Ĥazon Ish maintains this as
            well (OĤ 110:10). See <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            The <em>shi’ur</em> of a <em>karpif</em> is 70 <em>amot</em> and
            four <em>tefaĥim</em>. Following the updated calculation described

            As mentioned above, two cities or neighborhoods do not join
            together if they are separated by 64 m, which is double the size of
            a city’s outskirts (SA 398:7). Rema adds that if the entire length
            of a city is bisected with at least this much space, then the city
            is viewed as divided in two. Similarly, if a park that is more than
            64 m wide stretches the entire length of a city, it divides the
            city, and each part is considered its own city. R. Ephraim Ariel
            Buchwald in his book <em>Kiryat Ariel</em> presents a ruling of R.
            Yosef Shalom Elyashiv that the Ayalon Highway, Namir Highway (north
            of the Yarkon River), and the Yarkon itself - each of which is over
            64 m wide - divide Tel Aviv into five cities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, for several reasons it seems that these highways and
the river do not divide the city. First of all, the Tel Aviv            <em>eruv</em> encloses all these parts, joining them together into
            one city. When the <em>halakha</em> speaks of a bisected city being
            divided in two, it is referring to a situation in which the walls
            have been breached. If the city is walled, however, it is still
            considered one area. Furthermore, even if the <em>eruv</em> happens
            to be down and in practice one may not carry in the area, as long
            as the majority of the <em>eruv</em> is still standing, the city
            may still be considered one area. <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> states
            this in ch. 28 n. 163 in the name of R. Shmuel Auerbach, who
            derives it from the laws of sacrifices (certain types of which had
            to be eaten within the walls of Jerusalem), for which a wall whose
breaches cover less length than its standing parts is effective (            <em>Tosafot</em>, BM<em> </em>53b).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the road bisecting a city is not straight, the rectangles drawn
            around each section can overlap, thus uniting the city even if
            there is no <em>eruv</em>. This opinion was expressed by R. Shalom
            Noaĥ Segal Weiss in <em>Tikun Eruvin</em> 2:5:39 (p. 211) and n.
            156 (pp. 236-237). <em>Maĥazeh</em> <em>Avraham</em> OĤ 70 states
            that even if the rectangles do not touch each other, as long as the
            distance between them is less than 64 m, they are considered
            joined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another justification for leniency is that the <em>shi’ur</em> of
            64 m - double the size of a city’s outskirts - was based on the
            standards in talmudic times. However, now that cities are much more
            sprawling, the entire area that serves the city’s residents should
            be considered part of the city’s outskirts. This can be derived
            from the law of a city that is situated next to a stream. If the
            bank of the stream that is closer to the city has a balcony that is
            four <em>amot</em> wide, the entire stream is considered part of
            the city, and the city’s <em>teĥum </em>is measured from the
            farther bank. This would seem to be the case even when the width of
the stream is greater than 64 m. MB<em> </em>398:46 cites Ritva (            <em>Eruvin </em>61a, s.v. "ve-Ra"Ĥ z"l") that since "this stream is
            in front of the whole city and is fit to be used by all the city’s
            residents, we can consider it an extension of the city even though
            it is not habitable." We may also add the possibility raised by MA
            (398:13) that from the status of the stream we can extrapolate to
            any place that the city residents use. If so, urban highways are a
            part of the city even if they are very wide, since their purpose is
            to be used by the city’s residents. This would also be the case
            with public parks and gardens. R. Michael Bleicher writes along
            these lines in <em>Teĥum Shabbat U-medidato</em>, p. 24.
            (Nevertheless, we see from Rema, cited at the beginning of this
            note, that the definition of a city is based on physical criteria,
            not on whether the two sections share a municipality.)
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, since the law is rabbinic, we may be lenient, whether
            based on the rationale that the city has an <em>eruv</em>, or on
            the rationale that the rectangles drawn around each section
            overlap. Each rationale is sufficient on its own, and they are even
            stronger when considered together. Even when distances greater than
            twelve <em>mil </em>are involved, where some Rishonim maintain that
            a Torah prohibition applies, we may be lenient based on these
            rationales. However, if there is no great need, it is proper to
            defer to the stringent opinion.

            See n. 3 above, which discusses the Sages’ uncertainty about
            whether the prohibitions of <em>teĥumin</em> apply to airspace more
            than ten <em>tefaĥim</em> above land. The plane in this case has
            flown more than twelve <em>mil</em> on Shabbat; therefore,
            according to Rambam and those who follow his position, who maintain
            that traveling beyond twelve <em>mil</em> on Shabbat is prohibited
            by Torah law, one who lands on Shabbat should be stringent and stay
within his four <em>amot</em>. However, according to most            <em>poskim</em>, traveling beyond one’s <em>teĥum</em> is never
            prohibited by Torah law, so we may be lenient cases of uncertainty.
Therefore, we do not have to worry about <em>teĥumin</em> above ten            <em>tefaĥim</em>. The passenger’s <em>teĥum</em> is established
            only once his plane lands, after which he has 2,000 <em>amot</em>
            in each direction, as I wrote in the main text. In any case, even
            according to Rambam, since the passenger’s arrival on Shabbat was
            unintentional, he may walk through the entire airport as long as it
is enclosed by a fence (see Rema 248:4; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 32;            <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> 8:20:62; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 248:4).

Two sets of laws apply to objects that arrive from outside the<em>teĥum</em>. The first is the standard laws of<em>teĥum Shabbat</em>. Objects carried outside of their<em>teĥum</em> are considered the same as people who left their            <em>teĥum</em> unknowingly or due to circumstances out of their
            control, since objects have no will of their own. Therefore, if the
            objects arrived in an enclosed area, they may be carried throughout
            the enclosed area. However, if they were brought to a place that is
            not enclosed, they may be moved only four <em>amot</em>. If they
            are returned to their original place, they revert to their original
            status.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second set of laws relates to benefiting from prohibited
            actions done on Shabbat, and the intent of the person transporting
            the fruits determines their status. If he did so knowingly, no one
            may benefit from his actions, and the fruit may not be eaten. If he
            brought them unknowingly, then since the prohibition itself is
            rabbinic, they may be eaten (<em>Pri Megadim</em>; BHL 318:1, s.v.
            "ha-mevashel"; see <em>Harĥavot</em> 26:4:1). If a non-Jew brought
            the fruit from outside the <em>teĥum</em> for himself or for
            another non-Jew, a Jew may eat them; but if he brought them for a
            Jew, that Jew and his household may not eat the fruit until enough
            time has elapsed for the fruit to have been brought to them
            permissibly after Shabbat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sages established that the laws of <em>teĥumin</em> also apply
to objects belonging to non-Jews, and such objects acquire a            <em>mekom shevita</em> wherever they are when Shabbat began. If it
            was permitted to carry objects belonging to non-Jews without limit,
            people might mistakenly come to believe that objects belonging to
Jews are also not subject to the laws of <em>teĥum</em><em>Shabbat</em>. Ownerless items, however, are not subject to            <em>teĥumin</em> restrictions (SA 401:1).

The Sages allow a traveler who wishes to establish his            <em>mekom shevita</em> someplace further along the way to do so by
            merely verbalizing this wish. This special leniency is effective as
            long as two conditions are met. First, it must be possible for him
            to reach that location before dark if he hurries. Second, at the
            moment when Shabbat begins, he must be within 2,000 <em>amot</em>
            of the location (SA 409:11). However, if he intends to establish
            his <em>mekom shevita</em> somewhere beyond his 2,000 <em>amot</em>
            , he loses his <em>teĥum</em> Shabbat, and he may not move beyond
            his four <em>amot</em>, since he cannot establish the desired
location as his <em>mekom shevita</em>, as he is beyond its<em>teĥum</em>, and he cannot establish his current location as his            <em>mekom shevita</em> either, since he pushed it out of his mind.
This is the opinion of Rashba, Rosh (<em>Eruvin</em> 4:13), and            <em>Tur</em> (409:11). However, according to Rambam, whenever one
            fails to establish his <em>mekom shevita</em> at his desired
            location, he establishes it at his current location<em> </em>
instead. SA cites Rambam as a secondary opinion ("            <em>yesh omrim</em>").
        </p>
        <p>
            If one is traveling and wishes to establish his place verbally, he
must specify the four <em>amot</em> that he intends as his            <em>mekom shevita</em>. An example of such a verbalization might be
            "The four <em>amot</em> surrounding such-and-such tree trunk." If
            he did not delineate the area precisely, according to most Rishonim
            the entire uncertain area is included in his <em>mekom shevita</em>
            . If he said, "My place for Shabbat is under that tree," but half
            the tree is outside his 2,000 <em>amot</em>, he has not established
a <em>mekom shevita</em>, and he is left with only his four            <em>amot</em>. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, according to
            Rambam, whenever one does not specify his <em>mekom shevita</em>
            adequately, rendering his desired <em>teĥum</em> ineffective, his
            current location becomes his <em>mekom shevita </em>instead, and
            his <em>teĥum</em> is 2,000 <em>amot</em> from there. Under
            pressing circumstances, one may rely on this opinion.

            At first glance, it would seem that in most large cities, setting
            aside an <em>eruv</em> <em>teĥumin</em> is ineffective. After all,
            we saw in section 4 that when one is outside the city at the start
of Shabbat, we do not include the whole city in his four            <em>amot</em>. He may travel within the city only as far as his
            2,000 <em>amot</em> allow. If so, when one’s home is more than
2,000 <em>amot</em> from the <em>eruv</em> that one makes, the            <em>eruv</em> is ineffective, and his status is the same as that of
any other resident of the city. Indeed, this is how<em>Beit Me’ir</em>, <em>Maĥatzit Ha-shekel</em>, and<em>Olat Shabbat</em> understand SA 408:1, and so states<em>Eliya Rabba</em> 408:8 as well. According to MA<em> </em>and MB            <em> </em>408:3, 7, 10, SA agrees that one’s <em>mekom shevita</em>
in such a case is indeed the location where he set aside the            <em>eruv</em>. Since he was in his home when Shabbat began, he may
            walk within the city in the direction of the <em>eruv</em>, but
            once he has left the city, he may not return home. According to
Rema, since this person’s home is in the city, if he placed an            <em>eruv</em> outside the city, he has a connection to both places;
            therefore, in addition to the 2,000 <em>amot</em> granted him by
            his <em>eruv</em>, the whole city is considered four <em>amot</em>
            and he may walk freely within it. Even after he leaves the city, he
            may return to it and walk within it. BHL’s discussion of this
            matter concludes with an endorsement of MA’s understanding of SA
            (408:1, s.v. "raĥok"). However, many rule in accordance with Rema,
including <em>Baĥ</em>, <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em> (            <em>Mahadura Tinyana </em>49), and AHS. SHT<em> ad loc. </em>11
            states that one should not object to those who are lenient in
            accordance with Rema. Since the laws of <em>teĥum Shabbat</em> are
            completely rabbinic, when necessary one may rely on Rema.

            <em>Eruvin</em>
26a states that one may use a saltwater mixture for an<em>eruv</em>, and Rambam writes this as well (MT, Laws of            <em>Eruvin</em> 1:8). However, based on the continuation of the
            Gemara, <em>Tosafot</em> <em>ad loc. </em>s.v. "aval" state that
            this is limited to a case in which oil is mixed in with the
saltwater. SA 386:5 presents Rambam’s opinion, and then cites<em>Tosafot</em> as a secondary opinion. MB <em>ad loc. </em>29            <em> </em>states that the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient
            first opinion.

            The Tanna’im disagree about this law. According to the Sages and R.
            Yehuda in the Mishna (<em>Eruvin</em> 36b), a stipulation is
            effective when placing an <em>eruv</em>, based on the principle of
            retroactive clarification ("<em>yesh breira</em>"). In this case,
            it means that when one decides which <em>eruv</em> he wants to use,
it clarifies retroactively which of the two potential<em>eruvin</em> he set aside before Shabbat was the true            <em>eruv</em>. The <em>beraita</em> mentions that some maintain
            that retroactive clarification is ineffective (<em>Eruvin</em> 36b
            and 37b). The Talmud in <em>Beitza</em> 38a cites the opinion of R.
            Oshaya that for Torah laws retroactive clarification is
            ineffective, while for rabbinic laws it is effective. This is the
            opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, including Rambam, Rabbeinu Tam,
Rosh, Ramban, Ran, and SA YD 331:11. SA<em> </em>413:1 and MB            <em> ad loc.</em> 7 conclude similarly. Therefore, one may set
aside multiple <em>eruvin</em> and then decide on Shabbat which            <em>eruv</em> he will use to establish his <em>teĥum</em>. (Some
            disagree: Ri maintains that retroactive clarification is effective
even for Torah laws, while Maharam of Rothenburg as quoted in            <em>Mordechai</em> maintains that it is ineffective even for
            rabbinic laws.)

            SA 413:1 uses the expression, "It all depends on his stipulation."
            This implies that if one places an <em>eruv </em>conditionally,
such as by saying: "If the Torah scholar comes to the east, my            <em>eruv</em> will be in the east," and then the Torah scholar
            comes to the east, the person’s <em>teĥum</em> is set and cannot be
            changed.
