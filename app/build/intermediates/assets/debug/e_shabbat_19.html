        1. <em>Ĥoresh</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Ĥoresh</em> refers to preparing ground for
        sowing or planting, by making furrows or holes in the soil in order to
        plant seeds or seedlings. Plowing also loosens and softens the soil,
        making it easier for roots to spread out and absorb nutrients.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, one who levels the surface of the ground violates <em>Ĥoresh</em>
        , because doing so softens the soil and makes it easier to prepare for
sowing and planting. Making even a small hole is a transgression of        <em>Ĥoresh</em> because a seed can be planted in it. Similarly,
clearing rocks from a field, fertilizing it, and weeding are all        <em>toladot</em> of <em>Ĥoresh</em>, since these actions improve the
        soil and make it easier to sow and plant. Anyone who undertakes any
        activity in order to improve the ground prior to sowing or planting
        violates Torah law (<em>Shabbat</em> 103a; <em>y.</em> <em>Shabbat</em>
        7:2). Even if he does not intend to sow or plant there, he has still
        violated <em>Ĥoresh</em>, since in fact he has improved the land for
        sowing or planting (<em>Eglei Tal</em>, <em>Ĥoresh</em> 16).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not make a hole in the dirt of a flowerpot or even stake
        something into the dirt of a flowerpot, thereby making a hole in which
        one can plant, as these violate the <em>melakha </em>of <em>Ĥoresh</em>
        (MB 498:91; see n. 4 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages prohibited sweeping the ground in the yard, out of concern
        that one would end up leveling the ground, thus transgressing a Torah
        prohibition. If it is arable land, he violates <em>Ĥoresh</em>. If it
        is land that serves simply as a yard, he transgresses <em>Boneh</em>.
        However, one may sweep a part of the yard that has a hard, paved floor.

    </p>
    <p>
        One may not kick dirt and sand, or move it around with one’s foot,
        because this both loosens soil and levels the ground. Saliva that is on
        the ground should not be rubbed into the dirt with one’s shoes, to
        avoid leveling the ground. However, if one finds the saliva disgusting,
        he may step on it in the natural course of his walking, as long as his
        intention is not to spread it and level the ground (SA 316:11).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who has mud stuck to his shoes should not try to rub it off against
        the ground, because he may end up leveling the ground (SA 302:6). Some
        are not concerned about this possibility, and allow rubbing off the mud
(Rema, <em>Taz</em>). One who wishes may be lenient, but        <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is preferable to be stringent. In contrast one
may rub off the mud against a grate, tiles, or stones even        <em>le-khatĥila</em> (MB 302:28; also see above 15:2).
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. Dragging Objects and Pushing a Baby Carriage
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may drag a bed, chair, or bench on the ground, since it is not
        certain that doing so will make a furrow. Even if the item could easily
        be lifted off the ground, thus avoiding the possibility of creating a
        furrow, it may still be dragged on the ground. As long as the person
        dragging the item does not intend to make a furrow, and there is no
        certainty that one will be formed, this is permitted, as it is
        considered a <em>davar she-eino mitkaven</em> (SA 337:1).<em> </em>
        However, if it is certain that a furrow will be made, one may not drag
        the item, as it constitutes <em>Ĥoresh</em>. Even if one does not
        intend to plant there, making the land cultivatable is in fact an act
        of <em>Ĥoresh</em> (via the principle of <em>psik reisha</em>; see
        above 9:5).

    <p>
        In an area with an <em>eruv</em>, one may push a baby carriage or
        stroller even if it is clear that the wheels will make grooves in the
        dirt. This is because the wheels do not dig in and loosen the earth as
        a plow does. Rather, they pack down the earth, which actually does not
        effectively prepare it for sowing or planting. One may even pivot in
        the dirt with the carriage, because even then it is not certain that
earth will be turned over and prepared for planting (SSK 28:48;        <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:52).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. <em>Zore’a</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <em>melakha</em> of <em>Zore’a</em> refers to causing plants or
        trees to grow by, for example, planting seeds or saplings or by
        grafting trees. All actions that improve the growth of branches or
        fruit are forbidden by Torah law as well. Thus, pruning and weeding are
        forbidden, because these actions promote plant growth. Similarly, one
        may not water plants or fertilize the soil surrounding them. It is also
        forbidden to apply dressings (such as tar or paint) to a tree’s wounds
        in order to heal it (<em>Shabbat</em> 73b; MT 7:3, 8:2).
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not leave an avocado pit in a dish of water so that it will
        take root and begin to grow. Likewise, one may not put a branch in
        water so that it will take root and start growing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Included in the prohibition is germinating seeds in water so that the
        sprouts can then either be eaten or transferred to soil. It is also
        forbidden to soak seeds in water to soften them, preparing them to take
        root and grow (SA 336:11).
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
        However, one may soak barley to soften it before feeding it to animals.
        This is because one does not desire for the barley to grow; besides,
        the barley is removed from the water and fed to the animals before the
        roots emerge (MB 336:51).
    </p>
    <p>
        One should not toss seeds onto damp ground. Since they could start
        growing, one who tossed them would be guilty of planting on Shabbat.
        However, one may throw seeds somewhere they probably will not grow.
        Therefore, one may throw seeds in a place where people walk regularly,
        or in front of animals who will eat them within a day or two (SA
        336:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not open or close the windows or doors of a greenhouse in order
        to encourage the growth of the plants inside. However, if there is a
        houseplant in the room, one may still open the shades and the windows
        for one’s own sake, even though the sunlight and air that enter will
        indirectly help the potted plant grow. Since he did not open the shades
        and windows for this purpose, and the benefit to the plant is remote,
        it is not prohibited (as it is a <em>psik reisha</em> in a case of a
        double rabbinic prohibition, since the <em>melakha</em> is done both
        with a <em>shinui</em> and via <em>grama</em>; <em>Har Tzvi</em>, OĤ
        §133 and <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 5:29).
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Irrigation
    </h2>
    <p>
One may not water plants, as it helps them grow and thus constitutes        <em>Zore’a</em>. However, one may open irrigation pipes or turn on
        sprinklers before Shabbat even if they will water plants during
        Shabbat. Similarly, one may program a computer before Shabbat to
        activate sprinklers on Shabbat, as on Shabbat no action will be done by
        a Jew. One who opened irrigation pipes before Shabbat may close them on
        Shabbat, as this involves no <em>melakha</em> (see above 2:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who eats in a yard must be careful not to wash his hands over
        plants or their roots (SA 336:3). If the plants are small and their
        roots are short, the prohibition applies only in the immediate vicinity
        of the plants, but if the plants are large, the prohibition applies to
        the entire garden bed around them.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may pour water on the ground if there are no plants or roots
        nearby. Even though it is possible that eventually the water will reach
        roots or that wild flowers will subsequently grow there, this is not
prohibited since one does not intend this to happen (        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>336:27).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not pour water on his own soil if it is suitable for planting.
        Since this softens the ground, preparing it for planting, it is
        considered <em>Ĥoresh</em> (MB 336:26; SHT <em>ad loc</em>. 18).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Using a Sink Whose Water Drains into the Yard
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a sink’s drainpipe empties onto soil where plants grow, it may not
        be used on Shabbat by anyone who has an interest in the plants being
        watered. It goes without saying that one may not use this sink on
        Shabbat if it was intentionally set up to water the plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, many <em>poskim</em> maintain that one who does not care
        about watering the plants may use such a sink on Shabbat - for example,
        if the plants do not belong to him and he has no interest in their
growth. In a time of need, one may rely on these <em>poskim</em>.        <em> </em>To be sure, one who pours water directly onto plants violates
        a prohibition, even if he does not intend to water them, because he is
        helping them grow. In contrast, here the water is poured indirectly and
        is therefore a case of <em>grama</em> and permitted (SSK 12:19). If the
        water from the sink reaches plants that have already been adequately
        watered, whether through heavy rains or water that drained from the
        sink before Shabbat, then even one who is interested in the plants
        growing may use the sink on Shabbat, since he is not helping them at
        all.
    </p>
    <p>
Rain sometimes falls on Sukkot, and in order to prevent one’s        <em>sukka </em>from getting wet one might extend a sliding roof over
        it. When the rain stops, he will want to retract the roof, but he knows
        that if he does so, water that accumulated on the rooftop will spill
        onto the nearby plants. May he retract the roof anyway on Shabbat and
        Yom Tov? It depends: If the rain was hard enough and long enough to
        saturate the ground, one may retract the roof, because the extra water
        serves no purpose. However, if there was only a little rain, the roof
may not be retracted, because this will water the plants and violate        <em>Zore’a</em>.

        6. <em>Kotzer</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Kotzer</em>
        refers to cutting something off from its source of growth, and it
        includes harvesting grain, picking grapes, dates, olives, or figs, and
        pulling off any other fruit or branch from a tree. Cutting down trees
        to use for heating or building is included in this prohibition as well.
        It is also forbidden to pull grass out of a crevice in a wall or to
        remove fungi from bucket handles (<em>Shabbat</em> 73b and 107b).
        Taking an avocado pit or a branch out of water is forbidden as well, if
        it has started growing roots.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Torah law, there is no prohibition on picking fruits,
        branches, or leaves from a tree that has completely dried out. Since
        the tree is not absorbing nourishment from the soil, one who pulls off
        a part of it is not detaching it from the source of its growth.
        However, since this resembles harvesting, the Sages forbade it. (See SA
        336:12.)
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, if a branch was cut off a tree before Shabbat, since it is
        clear that the branch has already been detached from its source of
        nourishment, the prohibition of <em>Kotzer</em> no longer applies to
        it, and one may pull off its fruits on Shabbat. If it is a fragrant
        branch, one may pick twigs or leaves from it in order to smell them
        (Rema 336:8).
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Using a Tree
    </h2>
    <p>
        As a precaution, the Sages prohibited using a tree on Shabbat, out of
        concern that one may end up breaking off a branch or leaf. Therefore,
        one may not climb or lean against a tree
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
        and may not place items on trees or remove items from them. If the wind
        blows an item of clothing into a tree on Shabbat, one may not remove
        it. Similarly, one may not recover a ball that fell into a tree nor
shake the tree so that the ball will fall out (SA 336:1; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 3). One should take care not to place things on a tree
        before Shabbat if they will be needed on Shabbat (MB 336:12). However,
        one may touch a tree if he is not using or moving it (Rema 336:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only is using a tree prohibited, it is also prohibited to use items
        resting directly on a tree. For example, one may not use a swing that
        is attached to a tree, even if only one side is attached. One may not
        remove an item of clothing from a clothesline that is tied to a tree.
        Similarly, one may not climb a ladder that is resting against a tree,
        and one may not remove things from a basket hanging from a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if a peg was driven into a tree and a swing was hung from the
        peg, one may use the swing. This is because only the peg is considered
        resting on the tree, while the swing is resting on the peg. Since the
        swing is two steps removed from the tree, this was not included in the
        rabbinic prohibition. Similarly, one may remove an item of clothing
        from a clothesline that is tied to a peg stuck into a tree, because the
        clothesline is two steps removed from the tree. If before Shabbat one
        rested a ladder against a peg embedded in a tree, one may climb the
        ladder on Shabbat, because the ladder is two steps removed from the
        tree. If before Shabbat items were placed in a basket hanging from a
        hook stuck in a tree, one may put items into it and remove them on
        Shabbat, because this too is two steps removed from the tree. However,
        on Shabbat one may not rest the ladder against the peg or hang the
        basket on the hook, because that would be making use of an item resting
        directly on a tree (SA 336:13; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 63).
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding the roots of an old tree that protrude above the ground, if
        they protrude less than three <em>tefaĥim</em> from the ground (about
        23 cm), then they are considered equivalent to the ground, and one may
        sit upon them. However, if the roots protrude above this height, they
        are considered equivalent to a tree, and one may not sit upon them (SA
        336:2).
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. Additional Laws
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages’ enactment against using trees applies to shrubs and vines
        that have hard branches or yield hard fruit, like pumpkins. However,
        the enactment does not include soft weeds, bushes, or branches.
        Therefore, one may sit on a lawn on Shabbat, even if it moves the grass
        slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not smell an edible fruit while it is attached to its tree,
        lest one end up plucking the fruit in order to eat it. However, one may
        smell fragrant flowers where they grow. This is because he has no
        reason to pick them, as they can be smelled while still attached to the
        ground. If tree branches themselves are fragrant, one may not grasp
        them and move them closer to smell them, because one may not move them,
        just as one may not move a tree. If the branches are soft and pliant,
        as are myrtle branches, one may grasp them and move them closer to
        smell them. One must, of course, be careful not to pluck the branches.
        <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may walk on a lawn even though walking on it may uproot some grass.
        This is because he does not intend to do this, and it is not
        necessarily going to happen. But if the grass is high and it is certain
        that walking on it will cause some of it to be torn up, one may not
        walk on it (SA 336:3; BHL <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>.).
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only did the Sages prohibit using a tree, they also prohibited
        riding on an animal, lest the rider break a branch to use as a riding
        crop to direct the animal. The Sages also prohibited extracting honey
        from honeycombs, because this resembles picking produce (SA 321:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may bring his animals to a grassy area so that they may graze. This
        is not considered <em>Kotzer</em> because the animals are eating for
        themselves. We are not commanded to ensure that animals keep Shabbat;
        we simply must ensure that they do not perform <em>melakhot</em> on our
        behalf (<em>Shabbat</em> 122a; SA 324:13).
    </p>
    <a name="9"></a><h2>
        9. Flowers and Branches in a Vase
    </h2>
    <p>
        Flowers, branches, or stems that were picked before Shabbat for their
        beauty or fragrance, are not <em>muktzeh</em> on Shabbat. Therefore, a
        vase containing branches that are used for their beauty or fragrance
        may be moved. Similarly, they may be removed from the water for viewing
        or smelling. There is no problem of <em>Kotzer</em>, since there are no
        roots. One may also return stems to the water if they do not have
        flowers, or if they have fully-developed flowers. There is no problem
        of <em>Zore’a</em>, since the water will not cause any further growth
        but will only preserve their freshness so they do not wither.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, one may not place in water any stems with flowers that are
        budding or that have not yet fully opened, because placing them in the
        water causes further growth. Nevertheless, one may remove them from the
        water. This is not considered <em>Kotzer</em>, because they have not
        put down roots in the water. Once removed, though, one may not replace
        them. Therefore, if one receives a bouquet of flowers as a gift on
        Shabbat and it contains flowers that have not yet fully opened, one may
        not place them in water, as this will cause the flowers to grow and
        open. Rather, one should put the bouquet in a vase that does not
        contain water.

        10. A Flowerpot
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as one may not break off a branch or leaf from a plant growing in
        soil, so too one may not break off anything from a potted plant. If the
        flowerpot has holes in the bottom, it is considered connected to the
ground. Thus one who plucks anything from it transgresses        <em>Kotzer</em> by Torah law. If the flower pot does not have holes in
        the bottom, it is not considered connected to the ground, as this is
        not the way plants normally grow. Thus one who plucks anything from it
        transgresses only rabbinically (SA 336:7; MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>.
        42). Similarly, one may not water potted plants (MB 336:41; see n. 4
        above).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not move a potted plant from its place on Shabbat, because it
is <em>muktzeh</em>. It is considered a        <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> (see ch. 23) since watering its
        contents or picking them is prohibited. However, one may move it if he
        needs the space it occupies (below 23:8). If the potted plant is
        frequently moved from place to place for aesthetic reasons or so that
        it can be smelled, it is not <em>muktzeh</em>, since its primary use is
        a permissible one.
    </p>
    <p>
Sometimes moving a potted plant is prohibited on account of        <em>Zore’a</em> or <em>Kotzer</em>. For example, if the flowerpot has a
        hole in the bottom the size of a small root and it is resting on the
        ground, the hole allows the plant to draw sustenance from the ground,
        and thus it is considered connected to the ground. Thus, one may not
        move the pot from the ground and place it on a hard plastic surface,
        because that would violate <em>Kotzer</em>. Conversely, if the plant is
        on a hard plastic saucer, it may not be moved from there and placed on
        the ground, because that would violate <em>Zore’a</em>. Thus, if one
        needs to move the flower pot to use the space it is occupying, he must
        be careful to move it together with the saucer underneath it.
        <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a flower pot tipped over and some of its dirt spilled out, one may
        not put the dirt back in the pot, because doing so helps the plant grow
        and thus transgresses both <em>Ĥoresh</em> and <em>Zore’a</em>.
        Additionally, soil is <em>muktzeh</em> and may not be moved. Even if no
        dirt spilled, but the flowerpot’s fall exposed the roots of the plant
        and they will be covered back up if the plant is restored to a standing
state, one may not do so even using one’s foot (such that        <em>muktzeh</em> is not an issue), because covering the roots violates
        both <em>Ĥoresh</em> and <em>Zore’a</em>. (One may open a window in a
        room containing a plant, as explained above at the end of section 3.)

        11. <em>Me’amer</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Me’amer</em>
        refers to gathering harvested grain into sheaves or piles. Similarly,
        one who gathers picked fruit and places them in boxes or piles
        transgresses <em>Me’amer</em>, as does one who gathers cut branches or
        reeds to use as fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
        This <em>melakha</em>, as a rule, relates to objects that grow in the
        ground and are still located in the area where they grew. This is
        because the harvest is generally gathered where it grows. However, some
        types of produce are gathered in two stages. For such produce, both
        stages are prohibited by Torah law, even if the second stage does not
        take place in the field. This is the case, for example, when producing
        a pressed fig cake. The first stage in this process involves gathering
figs from the field, which is prohibited on Shabbat on account of        <em>Me’amer</em>. The second stage involves pressing them together to
produce a cake. Doing this even at home is prohibited by Torah law as a        <em>tolada</em><em> </em>of <em>Me’amer</em>,<em> </em>since this is
the standard way to form these cakes (SA 340:10; MB <em>ad</em>        <em>loc</em>. 38; see <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:5:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        Gathering fruit scattered in a yard is not prohibited by Torah law,
        because they are not located where they grew, yet the Sages
        nevertheless prohibited gathering them because it resembles a weekday
        activity. However, one may collect a few pieces of fruit and eat them.
        If the fruit fell in one place and did not scatter very much, one may
        collect them and put them in a basket. If they fell into gravel or
        dirt, even if they are all in one place, one may not gather them and
        place them in a basket, because doing so resembles <em>Borer</em>.
        However, one may pick them up one at a time and eat them (SA 335:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may collect fruit that is scattered inside one’s home, because
        gathering items inside does not resemble <em>Me’amer</em> (MB 340:37).

    </p>
    <p>
        Although according to Torah law, <em>Me’amer</em> applies only to
        things that grow in the ground, the Sages forbade collecting salt from
        salt mines. Since this salt looks like it grows from the ground,
        collecting it resembles <em>Me’amer</em> (SA 340:9). Based on this,
        several Aĥaronim rule that one may not gather eggs that were laid
before Shabbat (<em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em>; however,        <em>Shevet Ha-Levi</em> 4:39 is lenient). Eggs that were laid on
        Shabbat are <em>muktzeh</em>, and therefore one may not pick up even
        one egg.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Me’amer</em>
        does not apply to items that have undergone major transformations.
        Thus, one may gather cooked fruits together. Similarly, gathering
        clothing made from natural fibers is not a problem, since they have
        been transformed from their original state (AHS 340:3).

            <em>Davar she-eino mitkaven</em>
            refers to a case where it is not certain that a <em>melakha</em>
            will be performed. It is permitted in accordance with the opinion
            of R. Shimon in <em>Shabbat</em> 22a. However, if it is certain
that a <em>melakha</em> will be performed, it is considered a<em>psik reisha</em>, which R. Shimon agrees is prohibited (            <em>Shabbat</em> 103a; MT 1:5-6). According to most <em>poskim</em>
            , <em>psik reisha</em> is prohibited even when the <em>melakha</em>
            performed is rabbinic. Their proof for this is derived from the
prohibition on dragging. Even though the furrow is made with a            <em>shinui </em>and not by an instrument normally used to plow, it
            is still prohibited (<em>Shabbat</em> 46b). Others maintain that
            making a furrow by dragging a heavy object over the ground is
prohibited by Torah law, because it is not considered a            <em>shinui</em>. Rather, it is extremely similar to the classic way
            of plowing. This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam and R. Avraham ben
            Ha-Rambam. See <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:1:6. If a furrow would
            actually be detrimental to the yard, it would seem that one may
drag items, as the action would be considered a            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in a case of a double rabbinic
            prohibition (according to many), since the furrow is made in a way
            that is irregular as well as destructive. See above, ch. 9 n. 2.

            If one plants a seed on Shabbat but removes the seed from the
            ground before it takes root, then according to Rashash, he has not
            violated Torah law, because the prohibition takes place only when
the seed takes root. According to <em>Minĥat Ĥinukh</em> and            <em>Eglei Tal</em>, <em>Zore’a</em> 8, simply placing the seeds is
            already a Torah prohibition.

            According to <em>Nishmat Adam</em> 11:1 and AHS 336:30, planting
            seeds even in a planter that does not have holes is prohibited by
Torah law. In contrast, according to Mahari Ĥagiz and            <em>Eglei Tal</em>, <em>Zore’a</em> 9, the prohibition is rabbinic,
            since normally people do not plant using such a flowerpot. The
            reason that soaking seeds is prohibited by Torah law is because
            that is the way it is generally done (see <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em>
            vol. 2 ch. 3 n. 33). Recently, people have begun growing seeds and
            plants hydroponically, using water and a combination of chemicals
            to substitute for the nutrients normally found in soil. It would
            seem that all would agree that one who plants seeds hydroponically
            violates Torah law, since nowadays this is a normal way of
planting, similar to the case of planting in dirt on a roof (            <em>Responsa Rosh</em> 2:4).

This is the approach of <em>Ĥut </em><em>Shani</em> (            <em>melekhet Zore’a</em>) and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 18 n. 10;
            see <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 336:29. Concerning the sink, I followed
            the position of those who are lenient and maintain that as long as
            one is not interested in watering the plants, one may use the sink.
            However, some are stringent and maintain that even if one is not
            interested in watering the plants, one may not spill water in the
            sink. This is the position of <em>Az Nidberu</em> 4:17 and R. Levi
            Yitzĥak Halperin (<em>Ma’aseh U-grama Ba-halakha</em> 4:2:5).
            According to them, the water that flows into the yard via the
            drainpipe is not viewed as arriving there through <em>grama</em>
            and <em>ko’aĥ sheni</em>, but rather it is as if the person is
            pouring it directly. However, in practice, when necessary one may
            rely on those who are lenient, as I write in the main text in the
            name of SSK. A <em>psik resiha de-lo niĥa lei</em> is only
            rabbinically prohibited (and according to <em>Arukh</em> it is
            permitted), so when it is unclear whether it is also <em>grama</em>
            and permitted, the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient position.
Indeed, <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 336, <em>Zore’a</em> 9 and            <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:3:8 say as much. If the water that flows
            from the sink reaches plants that have no need of water - whether
            because there was heavy rainfall and the ground is saturated, or a
            large amount of water flowed from the sink before Shabbat -
watering these plants is not prohibited on account of<em>Zore’a</em> (<em>Petaĥ Ha-devir</em> as quoted by            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 336:29). It would seem that in such a case,
            even those who are otherwise stringent would be lenient.<em></em>

            The prohibition of leaning against a tree applies only when one
            puts all his weight on it. In contrast, a healthy person may lean a
            bit on a strong tree, since leaning on it slightly is not
            considered using the tree. This is on condition that the tree is
            strong enough that it will not move. Furthermore, a weak person may
            not lean even slightly on the tree, since due to his weakness he
            may end up shifting all his weight onto the tree and thus violate
            the prohibition of using it (MB 336:63).

            One who unknowingly climbed a tree may descend even though he will
            be using the tree again, because remaining in the tree would also
            be considered using it. However, if he purposely climbed a tree on
            Shabbat, the Sages mandated as a penalty that he may not descend
            until Shabbat is over (SA 336:1). If he can get down by simply
            jumping, without using the tree, he should do so (R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach cited in SSK ch. 26 n. 45).

            Some say that the prohibition on using a tree includes moving soft
            grass or weeds (<em>Baĥ</em> and <em>Taz</em>). Alternatively, some
            prohibit moving grass on account of <em>muktzeh</em> (MA to SA
            311:6; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 336:62). However, most are permissive,
            as Rema writes in 336:1 and SA implies in 336:10 and 312:6. This
approach is also followed by MB 312:19; 336:15, 48 and            <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> 104:6. The grass is not <em>muktzeh</em>
            because they maintain that <em>muktzeh</em> does not apply to
            anything attached to the ground.

            Rema 336:11. According to Maharikash, one may put flowers in water
            as well, since even if they open it is not considered new growth.
            His opinion is not accepted. SHT 336:48 even states that a Torah
            prohibition may be involved. It is generally agreed that one who
            removed branches from water may put them back. Aĥaronim disagree,
however, whether one may put them in water to begin with.            <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em> and <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> prohibit doing so,
            while SAH and <em>Pri Megadim</em> permit it, as is quoted by MB
            336:54. SHT <em>ad loc</em>. 48 states that one may be lenient, as
            the law in question is rabbinic. This is on condition that he
            prepared a container of water before Shabbat. However, on Shabbat,
            one may not fill a container with water in which to place the
            branches. This is because it involves exerting effort for the sake
of the branches, which is prohibited, as explained in<em>Sukka</em> 42a in the context of a <em>lulav</em>.            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:53 is lenient, based on Rashba, and allows
            one to fill a container with water on Shabbat. The reason is that
while we are stringent regarding a <em>lulav</em> because it is            <em>muktzeh</em>, this stringency does not apply to other branches.
            As SA 321:11 states: "One may water a detached plant to prevent it
from withering." This is also the position of            <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> vol. 2 ch. 3 n. 18. It would seem that one
            may rely on the lenient position, since this is a dispute regarding
            a rabbinic prohibition.

            This law is explained in SA 336:7-8. If a flower pot has a hole in
            the bottom, one may not lift it from the ground and place it on
            pegs. Even if it is only removed for a short period of time, and
            even if there is no object coming between it and the ground, it has
            nevertheless been distanced from its life source. Similarly, one
            may not remove the flower pot from the pegs and return it to the
            ground (SA 336:8 and MB <em>ad loc</em>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many opinions about how big the hole must be. The
            standard ruling is about 2-2.5 cm. There is disagreement whether
floor tiles are viewed as separating the hole from the ground.            <em>Brit Olam</em> and <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:4:7 maintain that
            they do. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach says that floor tiles only
            separate the hole from the ground when they are on the second floor
            or higher. Ĥazon Ish maintains that ceramic tiles do not separate,
            but marble tiles do. If a flower pot is on a plastic saucer, it is
equivalent to a flower pot that does not have holes. (See            <em>Orĥot Shabbat </em>18:18 and <em>Harĥavot</em>.) Thus, as long
            as the flower pot has a saucer underneath it, it may be moved from
            place to place.

            However, some prohibit gathering fruit even inside, maintaining
that it requires just as much effort in one’s home as in the yard (            <em>Az Nidberu</em> 14:17; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:5:6). MB 340:37
            implies that this is permitted inside. <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:43:7
            also permits, maintaining that fruit inside is viewed as having
            already been gathered, and thus <em>Me’amer</em> is irrelevant.
            Even those who are stringent regarding gathering inside would still
            allow throwing candies or almonds at a groom in the synagogue. Even
            though children will collect them and put them into bags, it is an
effortless expression of happiness and not a weekday activity (            <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 2:5:7).
