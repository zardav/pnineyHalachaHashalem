        1. The Mitzva of <em>Ĥinukh</em>, Educating One’s Children
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a Torah commandment to teach Torah to children. Thus we read:
        "Teach them to your children" (Devarim 11:19). The primary objective of
        this teaching is to ensure that the children observe all the Torah’s
        instructions: "Study them and be careful to do them" (Devarim 5:1).
        Therefore, the Sages stated that alongside the mitzva to teach children
        Torah is the obligation to educate them toward mitzva observance. For
        how can they be taught the <em>mitzvot</em> without getting used to
        keeping them in practice? Thus, there is a Torah commandment both to
teach children Torah and to accustom them to keeping the        <em>mitzvot</em> in general. Nevertheless, the actual observance of
        specific <em>mitzvot</em> by the child is a rabbinic obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
        A child should be educated to keep the positive commandments from the
        time that he can understand what the mitzva involves, and can properly
        observe it. Thus, the appropriate age for each mitzva varies in
        accordance with its complexity and the difficulty of its observance.
        For example, a boy should be educated about <em>tzitzit</em> once he
        knows how to put them on, can make sure that there are two sets of
        strings in back and two in front, and can recite the <em>berakha</em>.
        However, since one may only put on <em>tefilin </em>if he is able to
        maintain a clean body and utter concentration, a boy should only be
educated about this mitzva shortly before his bar mitzva (        <em>Sukka</em> 42a; MB 343:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        The age at which we begin to educate children about <em>mitzvot</em> is
        about six or seven because that is when children start to study Torah
        in earnest and thus can begin to keep most <em>mitzvot</em> properly.
This applies to <em>berakhot</em> and prayers as well. The age of        <em>ĥinukh</em> is six or seven, as that is when most children can
        begin to do them properly. Nevertheless, we begin habituating them to
        recite <em>berakhot</em> and prayers from around the age of three, just
as they start learning Torah at that age (BB<em> </em>21a;        <em>Sukka</em> 42a; SA YD 245:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        The same principle applies to <em>kiddush</em> and <em>havdala</em>;
        from the age of three we begin to encourage the children come and
        listen. When the child understands the idea of Shabbat and can listen
        properly to <em>kiddush</em> and <em>havdala</em>, we make sure that he
        does so. If he is not present when <em>kiddush</em> or <em>havdala</em>
        is made, he should recite it himself.
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. Educating Children about Negative Commandments
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a mitzva to train children to avoid prohibited activities from
        the time they begin to understand that certain things are permitted and
        certain things are prohibited. In other words, it is not enough that a
        child understands that he must stop what he is doing when he is told
        "no"; rather, he must understand that what he is doing is never
        allowed. Most children begin to understand this at approximately age
        three. From then on, if one sees his child engaged in a prohibited
        activity, such as eating non-kosher food or turning on a light on
        Shabbat, one must stop him from doing so (MB 343:3). Once the child
        reaches the age of <em>ĥinukh</em> - when we start teaching him Torah
        at about age six or seven - one should begin to explain more about the
        principles behind the prohibitions, so that he will know how to observe
        them properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no mitzva to teach one’s child who is younger than three to
        avoid prohibitions. Therefore, if such a child finds prohibited food
        and wants to eat it, or if he wants to turn a light on or off on
        Shabbat, one does not need to stop him from doing so. Similarly, if
        one’s small child is a <em>kohen</em>, and he goes to a place of ritual
        impurity (such as a cemetery), one does not need to stop him, since he
        does not understand the prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of this refers to situations in which the small child is acting
        autonomously. In contrast, if an adult causes a child, even a day-old
        baby, to do something prohibited, the adult violates a Torah
        prohibition, for the Torah commands us not to cause a child to violate
        prohibitions. Thus one may not feed a child blood or insects or bring a
young <em>kohen</em> into contact with ritual impurity (        <em>Yevamot</em> 114a; MB 343:4). An adult may not even feed a child
        rabbinically prohibited food (SA 343:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is not prohibited to give a small child an item that he
        might use in an impermissible fashion. For example, one may give paper
        to a small child on Shabbat even though it is likely that he will tear
        it and destroy letters that are written upon it, as giving him paper is
        not considered the same as instructing him to tear paper. However, one
        who puts non-kosher food into a small child’s hand, though, is
        considered feeding him, as this is the normal way to feed a child (MA;
        MB 340:14).
    </p>
    <p>
        On Shabbat, there is an additional prohibition, for we are commanded
        not to have children undertake <em>melakha</em> on our behalf: "But the
seventh day is a Shabbat of the Lord your God; you shall not do any        <em>melakha</em> - you, your son or daughter" (Shemot 20:10). This
        means that if a child turns on a light because he thinks this is what
        his parents want, and his parents know and do not object, then in
        addition to neglecting the rabbinic mitzva of <em>ĥinukh</em>, they are
also transgressing a Torah prohibition by having their child do        <em>melakha</em> for them. If a child turns on the light for another
        Jew (other than a parent), who sees him doing so and does not object,
        that Jew transgresses rabbinically (SHT 334:54).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though we have seen that one may not feed a minor forbidden food,
if a child is hungry or thirsty before <em>kiddush</em> or        <em>havdala</em> or during a fast, then even after he has reached the
        age of <em>ĥinukh</em>, the adult may give him food and drink. It is
        only forbidden to feed a child food that is intrinsically non-kosher.
        If the food is kosher but rendered unfit by the time, a child who is
        hungry or thirsty may be fed (MB 269:1; above 6:9).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Who Is Obligated to Educate and Object?
    </h2>
    <p>
        According to some, the obligation of <em>ĥinukh</em> devolves equally
upon the father and mother (<em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em>). However, most        <em>poskim</em> maintain that only the father is obligated to train
        children to do <em>mitzvot</em>, that is, objecting when they
        transgress negative commandments and requiring them to perform positive
        commandments. This is an extension of the obligation to teach them
        Torah, which also devolves upon the father. Despite this, it is clear
        that the mother has a general mitzva to educate her children about
        Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>; the general commandment to love one’s
        fellow and the demand for truth obligate every mother to educate her
        children to cling to the holy Torah and observe its commandments. What
        is incumbent upon the father alone is the responsibility to
meticulously educate about Torah and <em>mitzvot</em> (Ri; Maharam;        <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em>). If no father is present, whether due to
        death or absence, then the mother is obligated to teach her children
meticulously about the Torah and mitzva observance (        <em>Eliya Rabba</em> 640:4; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 343:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, if a child who has reached the age of <em>ĥinukh</em> (about six
or seven) is involved in a game and does not want to come to hear        <em>kiddush</em> or <em>havdala</em> or recite <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>
        , the father must insist, so as to educate him properly. However, the
        mother may occasionally ignore such breaches in order to maintain a
        pleasant atmosphere in the home. If the father has passed away or is
        absent, the mother must take his place and insist that her children
        become habituated to keeping the <em>mitzvot</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        When parents neglect to educate their children and do not stop them
        from violating Torah law, the local <em>beit din</em> or public
        representatives who are responsible for local education must admonish
        the father. However, if the parents are negligent in educating their
        children about rabbinic obligations, there is no need to admonish the
        father.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree regarding what an adult must do if he sees
        someone else’s child of educable age (six or seven) desecrate Shabbat
        or eat forbidden foods. Some maintain that the obligation to educate
        children is the sole responsibility of the father, and nobody else is
        obligated to prevent them from sinning (Rambam; SA 343:1). Others
        maintain that all Jews are obligated to prevent children of educable
        age from transgressing (<em>Tosafot</em>; Rosh; Rema). Practically
        speaking, several Aĥaronim rule that if an adult sees any child
        transgressing a Torah prohibition - such as turning on a light or
        washing his clothes on Shabbat, or eating foods prohibited by Torah law
        - he must stop him. However, if one sees a child transgressing a
        rabbinic prohibition - such as eating chicken with milk, or playing
with <em>muktzeh</em> items on Shabbat - he does not need to stop him (        <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>; MB 343:7). It would seem that if a minor
        repeatedly transgresses the same prohibition, even if it is rabbinic,
        it is proper to inform his parents.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a minor is in danger of harming someone or damaging property, one
        must stop him in order to prevent the harm or damage. This law is
        derived from the mitzva to return a lost object to its owner: "If you
        see your fellow’s ox or sheep gone astray, do not ignore it…restore it
        to him" (Devarim 22:2). If there is a mitzva to return another’s lost
        item, there is certainly a mitzva to prevent damage to his property.
        Similarly, we are told: "Do not stand idly by the blood of your
        neighbor" (Vayikra 19:16). According to the Sages, the mitzva of saving
        someone’s property is included in this mitzva (<em>Sifra</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        We must stress that the mitzva of <em>ĥinukh</em> must be done in such
        a way that the child will be receptive. Therefore, one should not force
        a child to begin keeping all the <em>mitzvot</em> and saying all the
        prayers properly at the age of six or seven. A child’s early years are
        meant to allow him to get used to praying and keeping <em>mitzvot</em>.
        This way, by the time children reach halakhic maturity at the age of
bar or bat mitzva, they will be capable of keeping all the        <em>mitzvot</em> properly.
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. The Prohibition for a Child to Turn Lights On and Off
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the lights went off in a home, and a child understands that his
        parents would be pleased if he would turn them back on, the parents
        must tell him not to do so. As we have already learned, parents have an
        obligation to educate their children to keep the <em>mitzvot</em>, and
        this includes preventing them from transgressing prohibitions. Even if
        a child is not yet three years old, which is generally the age at which
        we begin teaching children to avoid prohibited activities, the law is
        more stringent for Shabbat. As long as the child understands that
        turning on the lights would be helpful to his parents, it is as if he
        is doing it for them, and they must prevent him from doing it, based on
        the verse we cited above: "But the seventh day is a Shabbat of the Lord
        your God; you shall not do any <em>melakha</em> - you, your son or
        daughter" (Shemot 20:10). This means that we are commanded to make sure
        that children do not perform <em>melakha</em> on our behalf. Even if
        the lights went off in a neighbor’s home and one’s child goes over to
turn on the lights for them, the neighbor must not allow him to do        <em>melakha</em> for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if a fire breaks out on Shabbat and a child attempts to put
        it out, whether at his parents’ home or at someone else’s house, he
        must be stopped from extinguishing it. Since the child understands that
        the adults want the fire to be extinguished, he is essentially doing
        the <em>melakha</em> for them, and thus they are obligated to tell him
        not to do so (<em>Shabbat</em> 121a; SA 334:25; MB <em>ad loc</em>.
        66). Certainly, then, one may not tell a child explicitly to turn on a
        light or extinguish a fire; as we already learned, an adult may not
        cause a child to do anything prohibited (<em>Yevamot</em> 114a).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, if a child mistakenly turned off a light, it is important
        that no one yell at him in a way that will cause him to try to
        "correct" his mistake by turning the light back on. Even if no one
        yelled at him, but he simply wants to correct his mistake and turn it
        back on, he must be told not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a child mistakenly performed a <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat (such as
        turning on the light), others may not benefit from it if he did it for
        the sake of an adult, but if he did it for his own sake, others may
        benefit from the light (BHL 325:10, s.v. "eino yehudi").
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Permissive Rulings under Pressing Circumstances
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, under pressing circumstances, one may tell a minor to
        transgress a rabbinic prohibition, but one may never tell a minor to
        violate Torah law. First, as we saw regarding <em>ĥinukh</em> in
        general, the Torah forbids causing a child to transgress. Second, as
noted, there is an explicit injunction against children doing        <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat: "But the seventh day is a Shabbat of the
        Lord your God; you shall not do any <em>melakha</em> - you, your son or
        daughter" (Shemot 20:10). We will now explain when one may ask a minor
        to transgress a rabbinic injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Rashba and Ran, one may tell a child to transgress a
        rabbinic prohibition if it is for his own sake. Even though this is
        forbidden according to most Rishonim (Rambam; <em>Tosafot</em>; SA
        343:1), under pressing circumstances we rely on those who are
        permissive (R. Akiva Eger; BHL 343:1, s.v. "mi-divrei"). Therefore, if
        the light in a child’s room was accidentally left on or turned on, and
        he finds it difficult to sleep, one may tell him to turn off the light,
        as this action is rabbinically prohibited. It is preferable that a
        child under the age of six do it. If the child is older than six, it is
        preferable that he turn it off with a <em>shinui</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under pressing circumstances, one may tell a child to transgress a
        rabbinic prohibition, even if he does not stand to gain from the
        transgression personally. As we have seen (9:11), the Sages permitted
        transgressing a <em>shvut di-shvut</em> for the sake of a mitzva or
        under pressing circumstances. The entire obligation of a child to keep
        Shabbat is rabbinic, so if he transgresses a rabbinic prohibition, it
        is by definition a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. As long as one is lenient
        in this respect only occasionally, there is no concern that the child
will become accustomed to belittle Shabbat (<em>Mordechai</em>;        <em>Taz</em> 346:6; SAH 343:6; <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §124).
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the light went out on Shabbat in a place where it is needed, a baby
        who is not old enough to understand that his parents want him to turn
        on the light (about a year old) and who will play with a switch without
        understanding whether he is doing something helpful or harmful may be
        held in front of the switch with the hope that he will play with it and
        turn it on and removed from there as soon as he turns it on. Since he
        does not understand the implications of flipping the switch on and off,
        his action is not significant for the purposes of transgression.
Rather, he is considered <em>mitasek</em> (performing a<em>melakha </em>obliviously; see below, 26:3) (Rashba,        <em>Yevamot</em> 114a; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 24:7-8).
    </p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. A Child Is Comparable to a Sick Person
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade a Jew to ask a non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em> for him
        on Shabbat. In contrast, if a child needs something very badly, his
        status is akin to that of one who is ill, for whom one may ask a
        non-Jew to do <em>melakha</em>. For example, if a child has no food and
        is hungry, one may ask a non-Jew to cook for him. If he desperately
        needs light, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on a light for him (Rema
        276:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 6; see below 28:2). In general there is
        greater need to be lenient on behalf of babies, but one may be lenient
        even with very needy older children just as he would be lenient with a
        sick person.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        A child who is not feeling well may take medicine even if the pain is
        mild. Just as the enactment prohibiting the use of medication on
        Shabbat does not apply to a sick person, so too it does not apply to a
        child. Thus, if necessary, one may put cream on a baby’s skin, on
        condition that one does not spread it. Rather, one should simply place
        the cream on the skin. If the baby’s diaper then causes the cream to
        spread, one does not violate any prohibition, since the cream was not
        applied in order to smooth the skin (see 14:5 above and 28:8 below).
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Permitted and Prohibited Games on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a mitzva to educate children to study a great deal of Torah on
        Shabbat. It is thus proper to teach them to minimize game playing so
        that they will not get used to wasting the precious and holy time of
        Shabbat on mundane activities. The closer they get to the age of bar or
        bat mitzva, the more they should be encouraged to study Torah more and
        play games less. It is good for the parents themselves to learn with
        their children, thus fulfilling the mitzva of "Teach them to your
        children" (Devarim 11:19). It is proper for each community to offer
        many Torah classes for children on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, children may play on Shabbat. Therefore, the laws
        detailed in the following paragraphs apply to all children who are
        under bar or bat mitzva age. However, for adults the laws are
        different. First of all, <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is preferable to
        follow the opinion that adults may not play any games on Shabbat (22:13
        above). Second, even according to those who allow adults to play games
        on Shabbat, some games are problematic. For children, who are obligated
        to keep Shabbat only as training for adulthood, we are lenient; for
        adults, who are required to keep Shabbat by Torah law, we are
        stringent. Below we will explain the laws for minors. When adults need
        to be stringent even according to the lenient position that allows them
        to play games, we will say so explicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may play checkers, chess, and memory games on Shabbat. One may also
        play with dice and spinning tops. However, one may not play any game in
        which the winner is awarded money or food. It is also forbidden to play
games that normally involve writing (SA 338:5, 322:6;        <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 38:11). Some maintain that it is preferable not to
        play Monopoly or other games in which people win money and property,
        even though it is not real money. Children who wish to be lenient about
        this may (SSK 16:33), but adults should be stringent.
    </p>
    <p>
        All games that involve writing, pasting, cutting, or weaving are
        forbidden on Shabbat. However, minors may put together a jigsaw puzzle
        or form words by joining letters on a board. Even though adults must be
        stringent in these two cases, children may rely on those who are
lenient. According to this opinion, there is no violation of        <em>Kotev</em> since all the writing was already there, and the letters
        and puzzle pieces are simply being moved together temporarily (18:4
        above).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not build model planes or boats out of plastic parts if they
        require a great deal of precision and are meant to last for a long
        time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Children may play with interlocking blocks, build with them, and take
        apart what they have built. Children may also make paper planes or
        boats. However, it is proper for adults to be stringent. (See above
        15:7 and <em>Harĥavot</em>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages forbade making a temporary tent on Shabbat, but this is
        permissible if it is erected in a different order from usual.
        Therefore, children may not drape a blanket over chairs in order to
        create a tent to play in. However, this is permissible if they hold the
        blanket horizontally in the air, and afterward place chairs underneath.
        It is also forbidden to use interlocking blocks to build a house or
        garage whose inside area is a square <em>tefaĥ</em> or more, but if
        they start by holding the roof up and then attach the walls from
        underneath, it is permitted (above 15:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use a kit to make jewelry that is not made to last, on
        condition that the end of the thread is not tied with a regular knot
        but rather with a bow knot (SSK 16:22).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not sort playing pieces or cards of two games that got mixed up
        together, as it constitutes <em>Borer</em>. However, if people want to
        play one of the games, they may remove the pieces they need from the
mix. This sorting is not considered <em>derekh melakha</em> but rather        <em>derekh misĥak</em> (the normal way to play), because one normally
        begins such a game by taking out its pieces (above 11:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not make shapes out of Play-Doh or modeling clay, as it
        constitutes <em>Memare’aĥ</em> (SA 314:11). If one makes shapes that
have meaning, it also constitutes <em>Kotev</em> (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em>,<em>Yom Tov</em>, 92:3). Therefore, Play-Doh and modeling clay are        <em>muktzeh</em>.

        8. Additional Games and Playing in the Yard
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may compress a spring on a toy car so that the car will move
        forward, as long as the car does not make noise and no lights light up.
        One may not play with any battery-operated toy (17:2 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not blow up a balloon because a knot is usually tied at the
        end. However, if the balloon is sealed with a valve instead of a knot,
        and it has previously been inflated, it may be inflated on Shabbat
        (above 15:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        Children may not play with toy musical instruments such as trumpets,
pianos, guitars, bells, and noisemakers on Shabbat. Such toys are        <em>muktzeh</em>. However, one may give a baby a toy that makes noise
        when it is shaken or a button is pushed. However, the adult himself may
        not cause the toy to make noise (MB 338:1; BHL s.v. "aval"; SSK 16:2-3
        and n. 10; <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sand is <em>muktzeh</em> unless it was set aside before Shabbat for
        children to play with (23:3 above). In that case, they may play with
        the sand as long as it is fine and dry enough that it cannot be used to
        fashion shapes. However, if the sand is wet enough that one can scoop
out holes or fill them up, one may not play with it on account of the        <em>melakha</em> of <em>Boneh</em>. One may not make sand wet, because
        of the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Lash</em> (15:2 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not play with marbles on the ground, because one may level the
        ground to make sure that the marbles roll smoothly. Similarly, one may
        not play any game on the ground that requires that the ground be flat,
        because one may end up leveling it. Even if the ground is paved, one
        may not play there, as there is a concern that one might then end up
        playing on unpaved ground. However, one may play on the floor inside;
        since all homes today have flooring, we are not worried that playing
        there will lead anyone to play outside on unpaved ground (15:2 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is permissible to play with apricot pits, which children commonly
        play with; since they are set aside for this purpose by the children,
        they are not <em>muktzeh </em>like other pits. Even pits removed from
        apricots on Shabbat are not <em>muktzeh</em>, since many children play
        with them (see SSK ch. 16 n. 33).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may swing on a swing, but if it hangs from a tree, even if only on
        one side, it is prohibited. If the swing hangs from a peg that was
        driven into the tree, it is permitted (19:7 above).

        9. Ball Games and Running
    </h2>
    <p>
        Children may not play soccer, football, baseball, or basketball on
        Shabbat. Since adults make a big deal out of these games and they have
        intricate rules and procedures, they are prohibited, as they are
        considered a prohibited weekday activity. Besides, sometimes these
        games involve additional prohibited activities, such as preparing the
        field for a game, driving to the field, registering for the game, and
        buying and selling tickets or team merchandise. It is also prohibited
        to watch a soccer or basketball game on Shabbat, because this is a
        weekday activity. It is even prohibited to play with the balls
associated with these sports at home or in a yard, because they are        <em>muktzeh</em> and because it is a weekday activity. For the same
        reasons, all of the above applies to tennis as well.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Children may play and run around for their enjoyment but may not
        participate in exercise classes (see above 22:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        Children may play with balls designed for young children, on condition
        that they play indoors or in a paved yard. However, they may not play
        on grass or on a dirt yard, out of concern that they will level the
        ground. They may play table tennis for fun, since that is generally
        played indoors. There is no need to worry that by allowing children to
        play with balls at a young age, they will get used to it and will
        continue doing so as adults, since the permission is limited to balls
        designed for children, which in any case adults do not play with.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not recover a ball from a tree using one’s hand or a stick, as
        it might lead to breaking a branch. If the ball fell out on its own,
        one may play with it (19:7 above; SSK 16:8).
    </p>
    <a name="10"></a><h2>
        10. Bicycles, Scooters, and Skates
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may not ride a regular two-wheeler bicycle, because this is a
        weekday activity (22:8 above). Even if a bicycle has training wheels,
        one may not ride it. However, small children may ride tricycles,
        because tricycles are only used by small children, and there is a
        significant difference between tricycles and bicycles. Therefore,
        riding them is not considered a weekday activity (above, 22:8 and n.
        4).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some allow children to ride scooters and wear skates on Shabbat.
        According to them, just as children may run on Shabbat, they may use
        scooters and skates. Opposing them are those who feel that while
        children may run on Shabbat, that permission is limited to unassisted
        movement. In contrast, using equipment that makes one move faster and
        more effectively is considered a weekday activity.
    </p>
    <p>
Even though those who are lenient here have an opinion on which to rely        <em>be-di’avad</em>, it is proper to be stringent, since the stringent
        opinion seems more compelling. Just as the widespread practice is to
        refrain from riding bicycles because this is a weekday activity that
        clashes with the spirit of Shabbat, it is similarly inappropriate to
        use scooters or skates on Shabbat. Additionally, by our limiting small
        children to simpler games, older children will learn to dedicate
        Shabbat to Torah and to rest.

All agree that a mother must educate her children about Torah and            <em>mitzvot</em>. Part of the mitzva of "Love your fellow as
            yourself (<em>Ve-ahavta le-re’akha kamokha</em>)" (Vayikra 19:18)
is enabling one’s child to benefit from engaging in Torah and            <em>mitzvot</em>. The mother is also obligated on account of
"Reprove your friend (<em>Hokhe’aĥ tokhi’aĥ et amitekha</em>)" (            <em>ibid</em>. v. 17). Elaborating on this, the Sages tell us: "If
            one is able to object to the members of his household sinning but
does not do so, he is held responsible for their sin" (            <em>Shabbat</em> 54b). Nevertheless, the Torah tasked the father
            with the specific obligation to teach children Torah. If he does
            not wish to do so, the rabbinic courts can force him to pay for the
            education of his sons (SA YD 245:4). If he has no money to do so,
            he must sell his clothing or seek charity. The mother has no such
            obligation. Since the father is obligated to teach the children
Torah, he is also obligated to make sure that they observe the            <em>mitzvot</em> with precision. Thus, the father has a more
            demanding role - educating toward exacting mitzva observance -
            while the mother has a more general job - establishing a positive
            relationship between the children and Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>.
            This is the meaning of the verse: "My son, heed the discipline of
            your father, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother"
            (Mishlei 1:8). The Vilna Gaon (on Mishlei 20:20) writes similarly:
"The son is taught Torah by his father. His mother guides him to do            <em>mitzvot</em> and walk a straight path" (see <em>Berakhot</em>
            17a). However, if the father is not present, the mother must take
his place, dealing with <em>ĥinukh</em> in order to fulfill<em>Ve-ahavta le-re’akha kamokha</em>, <em>tzedaka</em>, and            <em>Hokhe’aĥ tokhi’aĥ et amitekha</em>. (See <em>Eliya Rabba</em>
            640:4; <em>Kaf ha-ĥayim</em> 343:9.) In some families, it is easier
            for the mother to be the demanding parent, while it is more
            difficult for the father. In such cases, it is a mitzva for the
            mother to take over the role of educating toward exacting mitzva
            observance.

            If an adult tells a child to do a <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat or to
            violate any other Torah prohibition, the adult violates Torah law,
            since the Torah forbids causing a child to sin. If the adult tells
            the child to transgress on the rabbinic level, the adult is
            transgressing rabbinically (<em>Yevamot</em> 114a; SA 343:1). There
            is an additional stringency that applies to Shabbat. If a child is
            about to engage in a prohibited activity on Shabbat in order to
            help an adult, then even if the adult did not ask the child to do
            so, the adult must object. If he does not, he is transgressing. If
            the adult is the child’s father, he is violating Torah law;
            otherwise, he is transgressing rabbinically (SHT 334:54).
            Therefore, when it is permissible to ask a child to perform a
            rabbinic prohibition, it is preferable to avoid asking one’s own
            child, as will be explained in the next note.

            In cases where it is permissible to ask a child to perform a
            rabbinically prohibited <em>melakha</em>, it is preferable that the
            act not be done by the child of the person who needs it done. As we
saw in the previous note, there is a Torah commandment not to have            <em>melakha</em> performed by one’s children, so even though for
            the child the prohibition is a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, for the
            parent there is only one <em>shvut</em> involved. If one of the
            parents needs to ask the child to perform a <em>melakha</em>, it is
            somewhat preferable that the mother ask rather than the father,
            since the primary responsibility for <em>ĥinukh</em> is the
            father’s. See <em>Pri Megadim</em> cited in BHL 266:5.

            Some maintain that the comparison of children to the sick applies
            only until the age of two or three (<em>Melamed Le-ho’il</em>
            citing <em>Sha’agat Aryeh</em>; <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 59:3). Others
            maintain that it extends until age six (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
            8:15:12:7, based on <em>Mor U-ketzi’a</em>). Still others say age
            nine or ten (SSK 37:2), while the most lenient say it extends until
            the age of bar or bat mitzva (<em>Or Le-Tziyon </em>2:36:4). It
            would seem that everything depends on the specific details of the
            situation. Thus MB 276:6 states that if a child is "very needy," he
            has the status of a sick person. The younger the child is, the
            needier he is. A similar point is made by <em>Nishmat Avraham</em>
            328:57 and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 20 n. 162.

            Some prohibit playing soccer and basketball on Shabbat out of
            concern that people will end up leveling the ground, similar to
            what appears in SA 338:5 and MB 308:155. Others forbid these games
            out of concern that the players will end up fixing the ball or
            inflating it (<em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em>). In any case, the
            rabbinic consensus is that one may not play soccer or basketball on
            Shabbat. It would seem that the primary reason is that it is a
            weekday activity (which is also the reason behind the prohibition
            to ride bicycles). This prohibition should not be taken lightly, as
            it is rooted in the Torah. Any activity that is burdensome and
            taxing serves to destroy the peace and rest of Shabbat, and is
            prohibited by Torah law (Ramban on Vayikra 23:24). The book of
            Yeshayahu elaborates upon this: "If you refrain from trampling the
            Shabbat, from pursuing your affairs on My holy day; if you call
            Shabbat ‘delight,’ the Lord’s holy [day] ‘honored’; and if you
            honor it, and not go in your own way, nor look to your affairs, nor
            speak of them" (Yeshayahu 58:13). The Sages elaborated further:
            "‘Not go in your own way’ - the way you walk on Shabbat should not
            be like the way you walk on weekdays…. ‘Nor speak of them’ - your
            speech on Shabbat should not be like your speech on weekdays.
            Speaking [about mundane matters] is forbidden, but thinking about
            them is permitted" (<em>Shabbat</em> 113a). Since soccer games and
            basketball games involve a big production, have intricate rules and
            regulations, and are taken very seriously by many people (some even
            make their living playing these sports), they are the ultimate
            weekday activity. The leniency for children to run for enjoyment is
            limited to running around freely, not in the organized framework of
a sport or exercise. Rav Kook presents this approach in            <em>Oraĥ Mishpat</em> §152.
