        One who prays the <em>Amida</em> must cleanse herself; it is therefore
        a mitzva to wash one’s hands before prayer. However, there is a
        distinction between a situation in which she knows that her hands are
        sullied and the normal case where she does not know whether her hands
        have been dirtied.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        For example, if one knows that her hands are dirty because she relieved
        herself or touched body parts that are normally covered – areas that
soiled from perspiration – she must wash her hands before praying.        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, she should pour water over her entire hand with a
        vessel, as one washes before a meal. However, <em>be-di’avad</em>, if
        she rinses her hands with water without a vessel, she fulfilled her
        obligation of preparing herself for prayer, because most important is
        that her hands are clean before she prays.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If there is no water nearby, she must take the trouble to walk up to
        the distance of a<em> mil </em>(912 m). If there is no water even
        within a <em>mil</em>, or there is water but the designated time for
        prayer will pass if she treks to it, she may rub her hands with sand or
        on her clothing in order to remove any trace of dirt from them – and
        then she may pray (SA 92:4; MB 92:20, <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>,
        5:2 n. 1).

        Under normal circumstances, that is, when a woman did not wash her
        hands recently but does not remember touching something dirty or body
        parts that are normally covered, the <em>poskim</em> disagree about
        whether she must wash her hands before prayer. Hence, if there is water
        available, she should wash her hands. However, if there is no water
near her, she does not need to wash her hands and may rely on the        <em>poskim</em> who maintain that hands under normal circumstances need
        not be washed before prayer. To dispel uncertainty, she should
        preferably rub her hands on her clothing (SA 92:5, 233:2; MB 92:26; BHL
        s.v. "Ve-im").

        One who leaves the bathroom after having washed her hands and is then
        careful not to touch the parts of her body which are normally covered
        need not wash her hands again before praying. However, if she was not
        mindful of that, she must wash her hands. If no water is available,
        since she is not certain that her hands are unclean, she may pray
        without washing.

            2. Preparing One’s Body for the <em>Amida</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages teach that one who needs to use the bathroom, be it to
        urinate or to defecate, may not pray (<em>Berakhot</em> 23a). There are
two reasons for this: 1. The need for relief is likely to disrupt one’s        <em>kavana </em>(Rambam); and 2. It is not proper to come to pray
before God when the body is made repulsive by the excrement inside it (        <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em>). Even if one is uncertain as to whether or
not she needs to use the bathroom, the Sages say that        <em>le-khatĥila </em>one should use the bathroom (<em>Berakhot</em>
        15a). The Sages support their statement with the verse (Amos 4:12),
        "Israel, prepare to meet your God." It is also written: "Guard your
        foot when you go to the House of God" (Kohelet 4:17), which they
        interpret to mean that one should ensure that she does not need to
        relieve herself when she gets up to pray.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who has a cold should wipe her nose before praying so that she need
        not do so while praying. If the phlegm in her throat bothers her, she
        should expel it before praying so that it does not distract her during
        prayers (SA 92:3). If she must wipe her nose while praying, she should
        do so in the most polite way possible. Similarly, if she needs to yawn,
        she should cover her mouth with her hand, because one who stands in
        prayer must be very careful to show honor to heaven, and all actions
        that are considered impolite before people are also prohibited during
        prayer (see SA 97:1-2).

            3. One Who Must Relieve Herself While Praying
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There are two levels of need: 1) a need so pressing that the person
        praying estimates that it is impossible to wait even the amount of time
        it takes to walk a <em>parsa </em>(approximately 72 minutes); 2) a need
        to relieve oneself, but which can be held in for longer than 72
        minutes. We will now describe the particular laws of each level.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one begins to recite the <em>Amida</em> when she will not be able to
        hold in the need to defecate for 72 minutes, her prayer is considered
        abominable and she does not fulfill her obligation. She must repeat her
        prayer after relieving herself. If she recites the <em>Amida</em> when
        she when she will not be able to hold in the need to urinate for 72
        minutes, though she clearly acted improperly, there is a dispute among
        Aĥaronim about whether her prayer is considered abominable. Since this
        ruling remains in doubt, she is not obligated to repeat her prayer, but
        one who wishes to avoid uncertainty may repeat the <em>Amida </em>as a
voluntary prayer (<em>tefilat nedava</em>) (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 8 n. 7).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
If one is able to control herself for 72 minutes and she recites the        <em>Amida</em>, her prayer is considered valid because her need to
        relieve herself is not so urgent. <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, even one who
        can wait 72 minutes should not pray. If the time to pray will pass if
        she goes to the bathroom, she should pray immediately so that she will
        not miss praying altogether (SA 92:1; MB<em> </em>92:5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The determination of how long one can hold it in depends on the person.
        If one initially thought she could wait 72 minutes after praying
        realizes that she cannot hold out that long, her prayer is still
        considered valid since at the time she started to pray she believed
        that she could contain her need (BHL 92:1, s.v. "Shi’ur Parsa").

4. One who Needs to Relieve Herself in the Middle of the            <em>Amida</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one began praying when she had no need to relieve herself but a
        great need arose in the middle of her prayer, since she began praying
        in a permitted state, she may continue her prayer for as long as she
        can hold it in. Even if she knew ahead of time that she needs the
        bathroom, but she thought she could hold it in for 72 minutes, but when
        she started praying she suddenly felt that she could no longer control
        herself for 72 minutes, although <em>le-khatĥila</em> she should have
        relieved herself before praying, since she began praying with the
        thought that she would be able to wait, she may finish praying.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If her need to relieve herself is so urgent that she cannot wait any
        longer, she should go immediately. If the interruption in her prayer
lasts long enough that in that time she could have prayed the full<em>Amida</em> prayer from beginning to end, she must start the        <em>Amida</em> again. But if the interruption lasts less time, she
        continues from the <em>berakha</em> at which she stopped.

            Sacred Matters
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Just as one who needs to relieve herself and cannot wait 72 minutes is
forbidden to pray, so too she may not recite <em>berakhot</em>, say        <em>Shema,</em> or study Torah, for it is not proper to engage in
        sacred matters when one’s body is offensive. Yet there is a significant
difference between the <em>Amida</em> and other sacred matters ("        <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>"). During the <em>Amida</em>, we are like
        subjects standing before the King. If one does not pray in the proper
        manner, she disgraces the honor of heaven, and her prayer is an
        abomination. Therefore, when the person reciting the <em>Amida</em>
        cannot control her need for 72 minutes, her prayer is invalid. This is
        not so regarding other matters of sanctity. While saying them, one is
not considered to be standing before the King. Hence,        <em>be-di’avad</em>, if she recites <em>berakhot</em> or <em>Shema</em>
        even when she is not able to control her need for 72 minutes, she
fulfills her obligation (MB 92:6; BHL s.v. "Afilu Be-divrei Torah";        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
One who can wait 72 minutes, according to most Aĥaronim, is permitted        <em>le-khatĥila</em> to recite <em>berakhot</em> and study Torah,
        though there are those who say that it is preferable for her to relieve
        herself first (MB 92:7). However, if she must exert herself in doing
        so, she is not required to relieve herself.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who begins studying Torah when she does not need to relieve
        herself, but in the course of studying feels a need, to the point where
        she can no longer wait 72 minutes, should <em>le-khatĥila</em> go and
        relieve herself. If she is in the middle of a topic, some say that she
may continue to learn until she completes it (BHL 92:2 s.v. "Koreh";        <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, vol. 2, p. 338), whereas others say that she
        should relieve herself immediately (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>3:48).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If she is teaching Torah, she should finish her class and then relieve
        herself, for human dignity (<em>kevod ha-briyot</em>) is so great that
        it overrides the rabbinic prohibition of "<em>bal teshaktzu</em>" (MB
        92:7). Likewise, it is proper that a student in a class waits and does
        not leave in the middle out of respect for the class, as long as the
        need to relieve herself is not that great. If, out of respect for the
class, we are lenient regarding the prohibition of "        <em>bal teshaktzu</em>," we certainly refrain as much as possible from
        going in and out of the class for other reasons, and it is certainly
        forbidden to disrupt the class by talking.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One must be clearheaded when she prays. Unlike many idol worshipers,
        who perform their rituals using drugs and alcohol to attain a state of
        ecstasy, our petitions to God are achieved through seriousness and deep
        thought. That is why the Torah commands the <em>kohanim</em> not to
        enter the Temple and perform the Divine service while inebriated
        (Vayikra 10:8-11). The Sages derive from this that one who is drunk or
        tipsy may not pray.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        "Tipsy" ("<em>shatui</em>")<em> </em>describes one who is slightly
        under the influence of alcohol, and finds it somewhat difficult to
        concentrate and focus her thoughts, but is still capable of talking
        before the King. "Drunk" ("<em>shikor</em>")<em> </em>describes one who
        drank so much that she cannot properly speak before the King.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A drunken person who mistakenly starts to pray must stop immediately,
        for the prayer of one who is intoxicated is an abomination. Even if she
        concludes her prayer, she does not fulfill her obligation. If she
        becomes sober before deadline to pray, she must repeat the prayer
        properly (SA 99:1). However, <em>be-di’avad</em>, one who prays while
        tipsy fulfills her obligation, since she is able to speak before the
        King. Likewise, if she begins praying and then remembers that she is
tipsy, she may finish her prayer (<em>Eliya Rabba;</em>        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>99:2).
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>

        A tipsy person may <em>le-khatĥila</em> recite other <em>berakhot</em>,
for example, <em>Birkhot</em> <em>Ha-nehenin</em> (the        <em>berakhot</em> one recites from deriving pleasure from something)
        and <em>Asher Yatzar</em>, but a drunken person should not recite them.
        Nevertheless, even a drunken person should recite<em> berakhot</em>
        that she can only recite at that time. For instance, if she became
        drunk at a meal, she should still recite <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>
(Grace After Meals). Similarly, if she relieves himself, she recites        <em>Asher Yatzar</em> (Rema 99:1; MB 11).

        One who has reached a state of intoxication such as Lot, and is unaware

        A <em>nida</em> (a woman who has menstruated and not yet purified

        cannot become impure, as it is written: "Indeed, My word is like fire"
        (Yirmiyahu 23:29). Just like fire cannot become impure, the words of
        Torah do not contract impurity (<em>Berakhot</em> 22a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There are women who customarily act stringently at the time of
        menstruation by refraining from entering the synagogue and touching the
        Torah scroll. Although in principle there is no explicit prohibition
        against this, these women customarily separate themselves out of
        respect for the synagogue. Nonetheless, the widespread custom is that
        women enter the synagogue during the time of menstruation, but only
        refrain from looking directly at the letters of the Torah scroll when
        it is lifted (<em>hagbaha</em>).

        As an aside, we shall mention that there are various customs regarding

        go to a cemetery at all, some say that women who are <em>nidot</em> and
        have not yet purified themselves in the<em> mikveh </em>may not go to a
        cemetery, some say that only during menstruation women should not go,
        and others permit going any time. Some women refrain from going to a
        cemetery when they are pregnant, whereas others do not. Every woman
        should practice according to her family’s or her husband’s family’s
        custom. Even those who are customarily stringent may practice leniency
        in times of need. For example, permission to be lenient and go to a
        cemetery is granted to one who will regret not going to her parents’
        graves on their <em>yahrzeit </em>(the anniversary of a death). Also,
        one who is concerned that her absence will upset others, or a woman who
        is afraid that people might deduce from her absence that she is
        menstruating, may be lenient. If possible, though, she should make an
        effort not to get close to the graves.

            3.65 km) ahead of her there is water, she must walk to it and only
            then pray. SA 92:7 states: "A dirty area is [defined as] the
            [normally] covered parts of one’s body, because they contain beads
            of sweat. For instance, scratching one’s head [is considered
            touching a dirty place]." This refers to rubbing the roots of one’s
            hair, but if someone only touches the top of her head, she does not
            need to wash her hands (SAH; MB 162:58, 164:10).

            the roots of her hair (<em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>7:2:14). One may rely
            on this opinion as long as she feels that this area is clean from
            the washing, although when her hair is covered, sweat accumulates

            The Rishonim disagree about one who needs to relieve herself but
            can wait 72 minutes. According to <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</em>,
            Rambam, and Rosh, she should not pray, and that is the ruling in SA
            92:1. Rif and Rashi maintain that she may pray <em>le-khatĥila</em>
            . In practice, when the need to relieve oneself is slight, one may
            be lenient, especially since there are people who always feel a
            slight need to relieve themselves. If, in order to relieve herself,
            she needs to exert herself to help push out the waste, then there
            is an opinion that she is not at all transgressing the prohibition,
            "Do not abominate yourself" ("<em>bal teshaktzu</em>"),<em> </em>
and she may pray (the notes of R. Mordechai Eliyahu to<em>Kitzur </em>SA 12:3, in the name of an opinion cited in            <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, <em>Vayetzei</em> 3). As I initially
            mentioned, <em>le-khatĥila</em> one must try to relieve herself
            before prayer, as explained in <em>Berakhot</em> 15a and SA 2:6.

            A woman who recites the entire prayer service and started to pray
            when she did not need to relieve herself, yet suddenly feels that
            she cannot wait 72 minutes, but still does not need to urgently
            hold it in to suppress the need to relieve herself, and if, when
            she goes, she will have to exert herself slightly to relieve
            herself: since she began praying in a permitted fashin, and her
            need is slight, she may complete the section she is reciting. If
            the need arises in the middle of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, she
waits until she finishes all of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> by saying            <em>Yishtabaĥ</em>, and then goes to relieve herself. If the need
            arises during the recitation of <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, she
            relieves herself at the end of the <em>berakha</em> or passage she
is reciting (MB 92:9; BHL s. v. <em>"Ya’amid"</em>;            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 5 n. 10).

            If her sudden need is so pressing that she must actively suppress
            it to prevent herself from urinating or defecating, at which point
she transgresses "<em>bal teshaktzu</em>" (Rema 92:2, based on SAH<em> </em>3:11), the law is as follows: If she is in the middle of            <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> or <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, since
            interruption at that point is not so serious, she must go
            immediately to relieve herself. However, if she is in the middle of
            the <em>Amida</em>, where a pause at that point is serious, and if,
            when she began reciting the <em>Amida</em>, she did not feel the
            need to relieve herself, she should finish praying. If she cannot
wait at all, should she go relieve herself (            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 5 n. 11).

            Regarding men, the <em>halakha</em> is that since <em>kavana </em>
            has diminished over the years, we are not so strict on this matter,
            and in extenuating circumstances, even one who is slightly tipsy
            may pray, especially when he is praying with a <em>siddur</em>, for
            there is no concern that he might become confused in his prayer
            (Rema 92:3; MB 99:3 and 17; see also <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>22).
However, we are not lenient when it comes to women, since there are            <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women can fulfill their
            obligation by praying one prayer daily, and some say even by
            reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.
If so, why should she recite a prayer that would be considered<em>be-di’avad</em>? Likewise, concerning the recitation of            <em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em>, the <em>poskim</em>
            disagree whether a drunk or tipsy person may recite them, as
            explained in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 5:11. Because women
are exempt from the recitation of <em>Shema</em> and its            <em>berakhot</em>, a woman may certainly not recite them when she
            is possibly tipsy. As a general rule, it is important to know that
            drunkenness is repulsive and even more so for, women as explained
            in <em>Ketubot</em> 65a. Therefore, there is reason for women to be
            especially stringent on this matter.

See <em>Beit Yosef</em> and Rema §88; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 10:8,            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 3:8; <em>Taharat Ha-bayit </em>vol. 2, pp.
            202-206. The above-mentioned practice of entering the synagogue but
            refraining from looking at the Torah scroll during <em>hagbaha</em>
            is cited by MB 88:7 and <em>Darkhei Tahara</em> p. 57. The time of
            menstruation refers to the time that blood flows from a woman’s
            body, but does not include the seven clean days of purity, as noted
by Rema there. Some <em>poskim</em> (AHS 88:2 and            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>11) maintain that when women are
            menstruating, they do not recite <em>berakhot</em> and prayers and
            do not enter the synagogue. However, in practice, as long as the
            blood does not emit a putrid smell, there is no prohibition.
            Likewise, the Vilna Gaon (<em>Ma’aseh Rav</em> §58) rules that it
            is unnecessary to be as stringent regarding menstrual blood as we
            are concerning urine, for menstrual blood is similar to blood from
            a wound. See <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>11:1-10 and MB 76:15.

            <em>Darkhei Tahara</em>
            p. 57 states, based on kabbalistic literature, that that it is
improper for women to enter a cemetery. MB 88:7 rules, based on            <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>,<em> </em>that women should not go to the
            cemetery until they are pure. However, the fact that single women
and widows, who do not go to the <em>mikveh</em> when they are            <em>nida</em>, regularly go to the cemetery validates the custom of
            married women, who only refrain from going to the cemetery while
they are menstruating, but not during the seven clean days. See<em>Taharat Ha-bayit</em>, vol. 2, p. 76. Also see            <em>Berakhot</em> 51a regarding women who return from visiting the
            deceased.
