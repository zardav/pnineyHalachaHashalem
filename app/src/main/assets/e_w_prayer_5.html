    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
The Sages instituted the washing of one’s hands (        <em>netilat yadayim</em>)<em> </em>every morning and the recitation of
the <em>berakha</em> "…        <em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu al netilat yadayim</em>"
        ("…Who has sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us
        concerning the washing of hands").
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One’s hands endow her with the capability to acting in this world. With
        her hands she can give and receive, exchange goods, use objects, and
        care for her body. However, along with, and perhaps because of, their
        versatility, one’s hands also descend into every worldly occupation,
        making them the most likely limb to get dirty and contaminated.
        Whenever it is necessary to elevate and distance ourselves from the
        lower aspects of this world in order to engage in matters of sanctity,
we wash our hands. That is the general meaning of        <em>netilat yadayim</em>, including the morning hand-washing. However,
        the Rishonim disagree about the reason for the morning washing.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to Rosh, since one’s hands are constantly occupied, they
        almost certainly touched parts of the body that are normally covered
while one slept. Therefore, in order to cleanse them before        <em>Shaĥarit</em>, the Sages instituted <em>netilat yadayim</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to Rashba, every morning people are created anew, as it is
        written: "They are renewed every morning; abundant is Your
        faithfulness!" (Eikha 3:23). One goes to sleep tired, gives her soul
        over to her Creator, and arises in the morning with renewed vigor. This
        new creation should be sanctified and dedicated to God’s service by
        means of <em>netilat yadayim</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In other words, according to Rosh, <em>netilat yadayim </em>in the
        morning is a preparation for prayer, and according to Rashba, it is
        preparation and sanctification for prayer and for service of God
        throughout the day.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
In addition to the reasons mentioned, the Sages of the Talmud state (        <em>Shabbat</em> 108b) that one must be careful that her hands do not
        touch her mouth, nose, eyes, or ears before washing her hands in the
        morning because there is a <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> (evil spirit) which
        rests upon one’s hands after sleep, and it is likely to damage those
        organs. Only after she washes her hands three times alternately will
        the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> disappear and, subsequently, the danger caused
        by touching any of her bodily orifices will be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Although the main reason for <em>netilat yadayim </em>is to prepare and
        sanctify oneself for praying <em>Shaĥarit</em> and for the service of a
new day, and it is for this reason that the Sages instituted the        <em>berakha </em>of <em>al netilat yadayim</em>, we are also careful
        about the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> and therefore take care to wash our
        hands three times alternately. This means that we first wash the right
        hand, then the left, then again the right and left, and again right and
        left.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Prior to washing, one must take care not to touch those organs that
        open towards the inside of the body – such as the mouth, nose, ears,
        and eyes (SA 4:3-4; MB 13). Similarly, one must be careful not to touch
        food or drink before washing (MB 4:14).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Kabbala teaches (see <em>Zohar </em>1:184b) that at night, when one
        falls asleep and remains inanimate, without thought or action, she
experiences a taste of death and a spirit of impurity (        <em>ru’aĥ tum’a</em>) rests upon her. This is in line with the Sages’
        statement (<em>Berakhot</em> 57b), that sleep is one-sixtieth of death.
        The essence of human grandeur lies in the ability to think, feel, and
engage in activities leading to the rectification of the world (        <em>tikun olam</em>). During sleep, when dormancy spreads throughout
the body, one loses, to a certain extent, the image of God (        <em>Tzelem Elokim</em>) within her, and <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> rests upon
her. When she awakens from her sleep and her consciousness returns, the        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> disappears, remaining solely on the extremities of
        her hands. By washing one’s hands three times alternately, the spirit
        of impurity is removed.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In order to completely eradicate the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>, one must
begin washing her right hand, which symbolizes the attribute of        <em>ĥesed</em>. Therefore, one should take the washing cup initially in
        her right hand and pass it over to her left, so that she pours the
        water over the right hand first and then the left, continuing this way
        until she has washed each hand three times (see <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>
        4:12).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Some explain that the main damage caused by the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> is
        spiritual; if one were to touch her eyes or ears before washing, her
        inner sense of vision and understanding would be adversely affected,
        and on that day she would be like a blind and deaf person concerning
        matters of Torah and faith. Similarly, if she were to touch her mouth
        or nose, the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> would harm her spiritual senses of
eating and smelling (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>4:19, based on        <em>Solet Belula</em>).

        <a name="_Toc402175175">3. <em>Ru’aĥ Ra’ah</em> Today</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to <em>Zohar</em> and the kabbalists, one must wash her hands
immediately upon waking from her sleep so as not to prolong the        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> upon her hands. They also caution against walking
        more than four <em>amot</em> before washing one’s hands in the morning.
        Therefore, one must prepare water before going to sleep and place it
near her bed so that she can wash her hands immediately upon rising (        <em>Sha’arei Teshuva</em> 1:2). There are those who are lenient
        regarding this because, in their opinion, the entire house is
        considered a single space of four <em>amot</em>. As long as one does
        not leave the house for more than the space of four <em>amot</em>, she
is not considered to have walked four <em>amot</em> before washing (        <em>Responsa Shevut Yaakov</em> 3:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Others maintain that <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> has been eliminated from this
world. <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Yoma</em> 77b) cites an opinion that        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> does not dwell in "these kingdoms" (France and
        Germany). <em>Leĥem Mishneh</em> states that it is implied from Rambam,
who lived in Spain and Egypt, that he, too, is not concerned about the        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> mentioned in the Talmud (MT, Laws of Observing Yom
        Kippur 3:2). Maharshal one of the greatest Ashkenazic poskim of the
sixteenth century, writes no <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> is found nowadays (<em>Yam Shel Shlomo</em>,<em> Ĥullin </em>8:31). Several other        <em>poskim</em> agree with this approach.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In earlier generations, spiritual and mystical power was more
        pronounced and intense. This was expressed on the one hand by the
        ability to attain greater and more transcendental experiences,
        emotionally and spiritually, such as prophecy, and on the other hand,
        by the presence of all sorts of sorcery and impure spirits. Over time,
        intellectual prowess took center stage at the expense of spiritual
        forces, and together with the cessation of prophecy, the impure spirits
        weakened and disappeared; their place was taken by the "evil spirits"
        of false and deceitful ideas.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Furthermore, there is an amazing tradition regarding Count Valentine
        Potocki, the Polish nobleman who had his heart set on joining the
        Jewish people and converting to Judaism. Since such a thing was
        prohibited in his time, he converted secretly and engrossed himself in
        Torah. Eventually, the Christians captured him and offered him two
        options: to return to Christianity or to be burned alive. The righteous
        convert chose to die by fire, thereby publicly sanctifying God’s name.
        At that moment, Vilna Gaon said that the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> lost some
        of its strength, particularly regarding the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> of the
        morning. For this reason, the students of the Vilna Gaon are lenient
        regarding walking four <em>amot</em> before washing.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In practice, according to Ĥida, MB (1:2), and <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, one
        should be careful not to walk more than four <em>amot</em> before
        washing. In contrast, there are <em>poskim</em> who are lenient,
        whether because the entire house is considered four <em>amot</em> or
        because today there is no longer any <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> on one’s
hands. Therefore, the common custom is to walk more than four        <em>amot</em> before washing. However, even according to those who rule
        leniently, the custom is to be strict about anything mentioned in the
        Talmud, such as washing one’s hands three times and not touching bodily
        orifices prior to washing.

            4. The Time to Recite <em>Al Netilat Yadayim</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The correct time to recite "<em>al netilat yadayim</em>" is immediately
        after washing and before drying one’s hands. However, the general rule
regarding all <em>berakhot</em> recited upon the performance of        <em>mitzvot</em>, is to recite the <em>berakha</em> first and then
        perform the mitzva. Hence, we make a <em>berakha</em> on the separation
        of the <em>ĥalla</em> (<em>hafrashat ĥalla</em>) before separating and
        make a <em>berakha</em> on the <em>mezuza</em> before affixing it to
        the doorpost. Yet, regarding <em>netilat yadayim</em>, the law is
        different. Since it is inappropriate to recite the <em>berakha</em>
        while one’s hands are unclean, its recitation is delayed until after
        the washing. Therefore, immediately after washing, even before drying
        one’s hands, the <em>berakha</em> must be recited.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In actuality, the <em>berakha</em> is usually not recited immediately
        following the first washing upon waking. This is because people
        generally need to relieve themselves upon waking up and one should not
        recite a <em>berakha</em> while having to tend to one’s bodily needs.
        Furthermore, according to Rosh, the washing was instituted to prepare
the person for prayer; therefore, one is obligated to recite a        <em>berakha</em> on <em>netilat yadayim </em>before praying. Hence,
        after relieving oneself in the morning, one washes her hands again but
        need not wash three times alternating, since the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>
was removed the first time she washed. She then recites the        <em>berakha</em> before drying them. One who does not need to relieve
        herself in the morning should recite the <em>berakha </em>on the first
        washing<em> </em>immediately upon waking up (SA<em> </em>6:2; MB 4:4).

    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
it is preferable to recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and the        <em>Amida</em> soon after waking up. First, it is proper to thank God
        by reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> at the very beginning of the
        day. Likewise, it is best to pray the <em>Amida</em> before becoming
        involved in other matters (see below, 8:4). Additionally, it is not
appropriate to have a long break between the <em>berakha </em>of<em>al netilat yadayim</em> and the<em> Amida</em>, for some        <em>poskim</em> maintain that the washing was essentially instituted as
        preparation for prayer (Rosh). Even a woman who does not pray in the
        morning because she is involved in household concerns should at least
        recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> immediately after rising and washing
        her hands, so that her <em>netilat yadayim </em>will be considered
        preparation for <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
A woman who wakes up before dawn must wash her hands, recite<em>al netilat yadayim</em>, and then recite all<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>. This is if she wakes up after        <em>ĥatzot</em> (halakhic midnight). However, before <em>ĥatzot</em> it
        is forbidden to recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, and therefore she
        may not recite <em>al netilat yadayim</em> either. Instead, she waits
        until after <em>ĥatzot</em>, and after she uses the bathroom she washes
        her hands and recites <em>al netilat yadayim </em>as well as the
        remaining <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.

        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about the status of one who stayed up all
        night. In practice, SA 4:13 states that such a person must wash her
        hands before prayer without a <em>berakha</em>. That way, on one hand,
        she fulfills her obligation according to the opinion that she must wash
        her hands, but on the other hand, she avoids possibility of having
        recited a <em>berakha</em> <em>le-vatala</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to MB 4:30, it is best for one who did not sleep all night to
        use the bathroom before prayer. After touching body parts that are
        normally covered, she can wash her hands with a <em>berakha</em>
        according to all opinions. This is the Ashkenazic custom.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In sum, according to Ashkenazic custom, one who did not sleep all night
        but is preparing to pray the <em>Amida </em>of <em>Shaĥarit</em> must
use the bathroom before praying and subsequently wash        <em>netilat yadayim </em>with a <em>berakha</em>. According to the
        Sephardic practice, even in this situation a woman does not recite the
        blessing after washing her hands (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>4:49; see
        below, 6:7 and 7:7, for the laws regarding<em> Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Why exactly does the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> linger specifically on one’s
        hands? Is it the mere state of sleep, when one’s consciousness abandons
        her and she is left without the ability to function? If so, even one
        who sleeps during the day would be required to wash her hands three
        times upon awakening. Or does the night, when the whole world ceases
        its activities, cause <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>, in which case even one who
        was awake all night must wash her hands three times?
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In practice, when both factors converge and one sleeps a regular
        slumber (at least half an hour), the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> rests upon
        her in full force. In such a case, immediately upon rising one must
        hurry to wash her hands three times and refrain from touching her
        bodily orifices or food prior before washing.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If one slept a regular slumber during the day, it is proper to be
        stringent and wash her hands three times alternately, but it is
        unnecessary for her to rush to do so since the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah </em>is
        not in full force. Also, there is no prohibition on touching bodily
        orifices before washing.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
If one remained awake all night, it is best for her to wash        <em>netilat yadayim </em>three times after dawn, as there are those who
        maintain that the night itself, or its end, causes <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>
        to descend upon the hands. Likewise, it is proper for one who arose in
        the middle of the night and already washed her hands three times when
she woke up to wash her hands again at dawn, (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 8 nn. 4-5).

        A woman who wakes up in the middle of the night in order to cover her

        child’s mouth or any other bodily orifice.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        However, if she wakes up to prepare food for the child or change the

        that she does not touch food or one of her child’s orifices with
        unwashed hands. Likewise, it is proper that a woman who wakes up in the
        middle of the night to nurse her child wash her hands before starting.
        However, if it is very difficult for her to go wash her hands, she may
        rely on lenient opinions that do not <em>netilat yadayim </em>of those
        who wake up in the middle of the night (<em>Eshel Avraham </em>

case, according to all opinions, no <em>berakha</em> is recited on        <em>netilat yadayim </em>performed in the middle of the night, because

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        We learned (section 2 above) that because <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> rests
        upon one’s hands in the morning, one must not touch food or drink
        before <em>netilat yadayim</em>. If a Jew touched food without washing
        her hands, the ruling is as follows: If it is a dry, washable food,
        like fruit, she should rinse it under water three times. Just as the
        washing of each hand three times purifies them, so too it will cleanse
        the fruit. However, if she mistakenly touched drinks or food that will
        become ruined when washed, some rule stringently that the food must be
discarded out of fear that <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> rests upon them (<em>Od Yosef Ĥai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 6), but according to most        <em>poskim</em>, even those foods that cannot be washed may be eaten.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
There are two reasons for this: first, according to most        <em>poskim</em>, the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> on one’s hands does not have
        the ability to render food unfit for eating (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 2:2;
MB 4:14; AHS 4:15). Regarding alcoholic beverages, there are<em>poskim</em> who are stringent, but it is the consensus of most        <em>poskim</em> that all other foods do not become invalidated by the
        touch of unwashed hands (BHL 4:5 s.v. "Lo"). Furthermore, as we have
        seen (section 3 above), some maintain that <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> has
        been eradicated from this world and thus need not be feared. Therefore,
        one should not discard or waste food touched by unwashed hands.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Similarly, it is permissible <em>le-khatĥila</em> to buy bread or other
        food from off a store shelf, even though there is concern that it was
        touched by Jews who did not wash their hands in the morning. This is
        because, as we have already learned, according to most <em>poskim</em>,
        food is not invalidated by the touch of unwashed hands. Additionally,
        there is doubt as to whether these foods were actually touched by
        someone who did not wash his hands in the morning. Moreover, almost all
        people usually wash their hands in the morning, and it is said in the
        name of Arizal (<em>Od Yosef Ĥai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 8), that even
washing one’s hands once effectively weakens the power of        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>.

        Several major Aĥaronim write that it is important to ensure that even
        small children wash their hands in the morning. Even though they have
        not yet reached school age (<em>gil ĥinukh</em>), since they touch
food, their hands must be washed so that the food is not damaged by the<em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> on their hands (Ĥida; <em>Pri Megadim</em>,        <em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 4:7; MB 4:10). Additionally, there are some
who practice the extra-pious custom of washing even a newborn’s hands (        <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 10), for by doing so, the
        children are raised in purity and sanctity.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        However, in practice, most people are not strict about washing their
        children’s hands three times after they wake up, because according to
        some prominent Aĥaronim, <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> only lingers on the hands
        of girls who are at least twelve years old and boys who are at least
        thirteen. This is because the spirit of impurity affects those who can
connect to holiness and act to repair the world. Hence, the        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> does not rest on the hands of gentiles, for they
are not obligated to perform <em>mitzvot</em>. Similarly,        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> does not rest in full force on the hands of
children who have not been initiated into the duties of        <em>mitzvot</em>. Still, there is a mitzva educate minors in mitzva
observance, and once they start connecting to <em>mitzvot</em>,        <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> lingers upon them a bit as well. Therefore, from
        the time they reach the age of education and are capable of
        comprehending how to wash their hands, one is obligated to educate them
and accustom them to washing (based on SAH 2:4:2;<em>Eshel Avraham </em>[Buczacz]<em> </em>4:3; <em>Tzitz</em>        <em>Eliezer </em>7:2:4).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
In conclusion, there is a mitzva to habituate children in        <em>netilat yadayim </em>from the time they reach the age of education,
and it is an obligation to wash their hands starting from the age of        <em>mitzvot</em>, meaning twelve years old for a girl and thirteen for
        a boy. Some are strict and wash their baby’s hands from the time he
        touches food (MB 4:10). Additionally, there are individuals who enhance
the mitzva by washing their baby’s hands from the time of his        <em>brit mila</em> or even from birth, for even then Israel’s unique
holiness begins to appear (cited parenthetically in SAH        <em> ad loc.</em>; see also <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>4:22).

There are two sources for the morning <em>netilat yadayim</em>:<em>Berakhot</em> 60b, where it appears as one of            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> (which Rashba takes as support for his
            position) and <em>Berakhot</em> 14b-15a, where it appears as a
            preparation for prayer (consistent with the opinion of Rosh).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <em>Responsa Maĥazeh Eliyahu</em>
§11 states that a woman who does not intend to pray            <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> on a particular day should wash without
            reciting a <em>berakha</em>, for according to Rosh this washing was
instituted specifically for prayer. Even from Rashba’s words (            <em>Responsa Rashba </em>1:153), it can be inferred that the
            enactment of <em>netilat yadayim </em>is for <em>Shaĥarit</em> as
            well as the new day. Therefore, a woman who does not intend to pray
            does not recite a <em>berakha </em>on the <em>netilat yadayim</em>.
However, if she recites <em>Shema </em>then she may recite<em>Al Netilat Yadayim</em>," since the Sages also instituted            <em>netilat yadayim </em>with a <em>berakha </em>before the
            recitation of <em>Shema</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In practice, women customarily recite the <em>berakha </em>on the
            morning <em>netilat yadayim</em>. Rashba can be explained as
            follows: concerning a woman who prays, the washing must be before
            her prayer, but regarding a woman who does not pray, the enactment
of <em>netilat yadayim </em>remains in force, and its            <em>berakha</em> indeed becomes part of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>;
            the purpose of this <em>netilat yadayim </em>is purity and
preparation for the new day. This is implied by Gemara in<em>Berakhot</em> 60b, which states that everyone recites a            <em>berakha </em>on <em>netilat yadayim</em>, with no
            differentiation between men and women, although certainly even at
            that time women who were caring for their children were exempt from
            the obligation to pray. Furthermore, it is possible that a woman
who fulfills her obligation of prayer by reciting<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> must recite a <em>berakha </em>on the<em>netilat yadayim </em>that precedes it, as those<em>berakhot </em>are considered prayer. Moreover, according to            <em>Baĥ</em>, even Rosh agrees that the Sages instituted the
            morning washing as part of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>; however,
            according to Rosh, even before <em>Minĥa</em> and <em>Ma’ariv</em>,
if one’s hands are dirty, one must wash them with a<em>berakha</em>. In sum, it seems from the Gemara in<em>Berakhot</em> 60b that the institution of            <em>netilat yadayim </em>in the morning with a <em>berakha</em>
            stands even without any connection to prayer. Yet, since the time
            to pray is in the morning, and because we must wash our hands for
            prayer, those laws were brought together, according to both Rashba
            and Rosh. But women, some of whom are not accustomed to praying,
            revert to the technical law, namely, that <em>netilat yadayim </em>
            is part of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and that it constitutes a
preparation and sanctification for the new day. See            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 8 n. 3 regarding those who
            disagree with the <em>Ĥayei Adam </em>and from whom there seems to
            be some support for the idea that <em>netilat yadayim </em>is not
only for prayer (as stated in <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 2:29 and            <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 2:5).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
The essential objective of <em>netilat yadayim </em>before            <em>Shaĥarit</em> is cleanliness, as it is written (Tehilim 26:6):
            "I wash my hands clean," and as detailed in <em>Berakhot</em> 15a.
            The reason for washing one’s hands before a meal is purification
            and sanctification, similar to the washing of the <em>kohanim</em>
            ’s hands in the <em>kiyor</em> (laver) before serving in the
            Temple. Although there is a difference between the objectives of
the two washings, the Sages instituted the morning            <em>netilat yadayim </em>based on the model of washing before a
meal, and even the <em>berakha</em> has the same wording.            <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, when washing in the morning, one should take
            care that all the necessary requirements for washing one’s hands
            before a meal are met – that there is at least a <em>revi’it</em>
            of water, that she washes with a vessel, that there is human force
            involved in the pouring (<em>ko’aĥ gavra</em>), and that the
            appearance of the water has not changed. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, even
            if there is no <em>revi’it</em> of water there, or a vessel, or
            human force, since the water does in fact clean one for prayer, it
            is the opinion of SA and Rema that <em>Al Netilat Yadayim</em> is
            recited. If the appearance of the water has changed and has become
            unacceptable for washing before a meal, one may use it to wash her
hands for <em>Shaĥarit</em>, but instead recite "            <em>al nekiyut yadayim</em>" (SA 4:1, 6, 7, and 22). However, MB,
            4:7, and BHL state that according to many Aĥaronim, even if the
water becomes invalid for washing before a meal, one may recite            <em>Al Netilat Yadayim </em>when washing before <em>Shaĥarit</em>
because the water does clean her hands enough for prayer.            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 4:11 and <em>Halakha Berura</em> 4:12 state
that one does not recite a <em>berakha </em>on the morning            <em>netilat yadayim</em> if there is anything that renders it
            invalid for washing before a meal.

            MB 4:4, based on MA, states that one who wakes up and needs to
relieve herself must first wash her hands three times without a            <em>berakha</em> in order to remove the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> from
upon them. After relieving herself, she must wash her hands with a            <em>berakha</em> because, according to Rosh, the morning washing
            with a <em>berakha</em> was instituted as preparation for prayer.
However, R. Ovadia Yosef (<em>Halakha Berura</em> 4:4;            <em>Berur Halakha</em> 4:4) rules that one should first relieve
            herself in the bathroom and then wash her hands three times so that
            the <em>berakha</em> will be on the first washing of the day, for
            that is the more correct way according to Rashba. Moreover, if one
            has a great need to relieve herself, to the point where if she
            abstained she would be transgressing the prohibition "Do not
            abominate yourself" ("<em>bal teshaktzu</em>") the law is that one
            must relieve herself first and only after that wash her hands. It
is possible to retort that there is no concern for "            <em>bal teshaktzu</em>" in such a case, since washing one’s hands
            takes so little time. The practical custom follows the opinion of
            MB and the kabbalists, so that <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah </em>can be quickly
            removed. Regarding the <em>berakha</em> before drying one’s hands,
            see <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 4:8. According to the Ashkenazic
            practice, one may delay reciting the <em>berakha</em> and combine
            it with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>. Nevertheless, it is best to
            recite it immediately following the performance of the mitzva, as
            per MB 6:9.

            In <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 8 n. 3, a dispute among
            the Aĥaronim is recorded, concerning how a man should act if he
            wakes up much earlier than the time to pray and he knows that he
            will need to relieve himself again before praying. Some say that
            according to Rashba he must recite the blessing on the washing
            closest to his sleep, whereas according to Rosh, he must recite the
            blessing on the washing closest to prayer. I maintain that it is
            best to recite the blessing on the washing closest to sleep.
            Certainly women, for whom the obligation to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em>
            is not definite, should preferably recite the blessing on the
            washing closest to sleep as part of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
            (based on the explanation given above, n. 1).

            Regarding when one who woke up after <em>ĥatzot</em> for a few

SA 4:14-15 maintains that every regular sleep at night causes            <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>, and in order to remove it, one must wash her
            hands three times alternately. Even so, in the cases above, I wrote
            "should preferably" because the author of <em>Eshel Avraham</em>
(Buczacz) states in the name of his father-in-law that            <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> is present only after waking up in the
            morning. Many who do not wash their hands when they arise in the
            middle of the night rely on this. The opinion of most kabbalists,
            according to Arizal<em>,</em> is that <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> only
            lingers after one sleeps through <em>ĥatzot</em>, but if one went
            to sleep after <em>ĥatzot</em>, the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> does not
rest upon her hands. Moreover, even if one who slept through            <em>ĥatzot</em> already woke up once after <em>ĥatzot</em> and
            washed her hands three times, the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> does not
            rest upon her hands a second time. Hence, according to this, it is
            not necessary to wash one’s hands three times every time one
            awakens at night. Additionally, there are those who say that
            nowadays <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em> does not exist. Therefore, only one
            who wakes up in the morning must be careful to wash her hands three
            times because the source for this stems from the Talmud. However,
            beyond that, concerning waking up in the middle of the night, it is
            not an obligation to wash one’s hands, though it is proper to do
            so. Those who follow kabbalistic practices must ensure that the
            first time they wake up after <em>ĥatzot</em> they wash three
            times. It is also preferable but not obligatory for one to wash her
            hands before reciting <em>She-hakol,</em> as explained in SA 4:23.
            Even if she touched normally covered parts of her body, it is
            sufficient for her to rub her hands on a cloth of some sort, as
            clarified in MB 4:61. Similarly, before using the bathroom, it is
            advisable to wash one’s hands because of the <em>ru’aĥ ra’ah</em>,
            but it is not an obligation, as clarified above. Additionally, see
            the opinion of R. Ovadia Yosef in n. 2. An elaboration of these
            issues appears in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 8:6-7.
