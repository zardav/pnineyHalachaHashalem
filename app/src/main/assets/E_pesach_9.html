Chapter Nine: <em>Kitniyot</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. The Origins of the Ashkenazic Custom
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>hametz</em> prohibited by the Torah is produced from one of the five types of grain: wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. Other species such as
    rice and millet, even if they rise, do not undergo the same fermentation process as the five cereal grains, and they may be eaten on Pesah. Although one
    Tanna, R. Yohanan b. Nuri, maintains that rice is also a cereal grain and forbidden by the Torah in its leavened state, the rest of the Sages maintain that
    even if rice rises, it may be eaten on Pesah (<em>Pesahim</em> 35a). This was the practice of all the great Tanna'im and Amora'im. In fact, Rava ate rice
    at the Seder (<em>ibid</em>. 114b).
</p>
<p>
During the medieval era of the Rishonim (c. seven centuries ago), the Jews of Ashkenaz (Germany, especially the Rhineland) began to refrain from eating    <em>kitniyot</em>
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    <em> </em>
    on Pesah. Initially, only some communities observed this stringency, but within a few generations the custom had spread to all Ashkenazic communities.
</p>
<p>
    Three principal reasons for this custom have been offered: A) Since <em>kitniyot</em> are cooked in the same manner as grains, in a pot, there is concern
    that if people cook rice on Pesah they will end up mistakenly cooking forbidden types of grain. B) Since <em>kitniyot</em>, like cereal grains, are often
made into flour, if the unlearned masses see pious Jews cooking and baking foods with <em>kitniyot</em> flour without concern for it becoming    <em>hametz</em>,<em> </em>they are liable to do the same with grain flour as well. The rabbis of the Talmud were not concerned about this because, in their
    day, Jewish tradition was clear and established. However, the tribulations of the exile and the scattering of Jewish communities gave rise to a fear that
    some Jews would be cut off from tradition and come to forget what is forbidden and what is permitted. Eating <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesah would cause them to
    err and eat forbidden cereal grains without taking care that they do not become <em>hametz</em>. C) Grain and <em>kitniyot</em> kernels are similar in
    appearance and are kept in the same storehouses for relatively long periods. It is therefore eminently possible that wheat or barley kernels would find
    their way into <em>kitniyot</em>, and when the <em>kitniyot</em> are cooked the grain will become <em>hametz</em>. This concern persists today, and indeed
    it is possible to find kernels of grain when checking <em>kitniyot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Another reason why kernels of <em>kitniyot</em> and cereal grain got mixed together was the common practice of crop rotation. Farmers often grow legumes
    for a year to replenish the soil of a field that had been used for growing grain for many years. However, kernels of the previous crop inevitably remain in
    the field. Thus, if a coriander or fenugreek crop is grown after a wheat crop, wheat will sprout among the coriander or fenugreek, and some kernels of
    wheat or barley will be found in the harvested crop of legumes. Experience shows that sometimes the quantity of cereal kernels in the <em>kitniyot</em>
    exceeds one sixtieth of the entire quantity. This problem applies to those species of <em>kitniyot </em>that physically resemble cereal grain.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
2. The Sephardic Custom    
</h2>
<p>
    During the era of the Rishonim, all Sephardic communities ate <em>kitniyot</em> and rice during Pesah, though they were careful to pick out forbidden
    grains. Indeed, R. Yosef Karo writes (<em>Beit</em> <em>Yosef</em> ï¿½453) that nobody worries about "such things except for Ashkenazim."
</p>
<p>
    However, some leading Sephardic Aharonim have written that many pious Jews refrain from eating rice during Pesah because of a case in which some wheat was
    discovered in rice even after it had been checked several times (<em>Pri</em> <em>Hadash</em>, <em>Hida</em>). The Jews of Izmir have a custom not to eat
rice on Pesah (<em>Lev</em> <em>Hayim</em> 2:94), and the Jews of Morocco refrain from eating rice and other types of dry <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesah.    <em>Ben Ish Hai</em> (Year One, Tzav 41) states that in Baghdad many laypeople do not eat rice on Pesah, and those who do must first check it two or three
    times. Each person should perpetuate his ancestral custom. Where there is doubt or difficulty in doing so, it is best to consult a rabbinic authority.
</p>
<p>
    Certain spices such as cumin, turmeric, and fenugreek often have grains mixed in and should not be eaten without a prior meticulous inspection.
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays rice is stored in the same packing-houses as flours and semolina. Therefore, those who eat rice on Pesah must buy packages that are certified
    kosher for Pesah and then check the rice thoroughly three times (<em>Ama</em> <em>Devar</em> 1:62) .
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. Spouses from Different Communities    
</h2>
<p>
The following question arises frequently nowadays: what should a married couple do when one spouse comes from a family that refrains from    <em>kitniyot </em>and the other from a family that eats <em>kitniyot</em>? A similar matter was addressed by one of the great Rishonim,<em> </em>R. Shimon
    b. Tzemah Duran (<em>Tashbetz</em> 3:179), who writes that they obviously cannot eat together at the same table while food permissible to one is forbidden
    to the other. Therefore, the wife must adopt her husband's customs, for "a man's wife is like his own body." If the husband dies, it depends: if she has a
    child from him, she keeps his custom; otherwise, she reverts to her family's custom.
</p>
<p>
    R. Moshe Feinstein (<em>Igrot</em> <em>Moshe </em>OH 1:158) adds that the wife's status is similar to that of one who moves to a place where the accepted
    custom is different from his own. If he intends to settle there, he relinquishes his previous custom and accepts the custom of his new home (based on SA YD
    214:2, OH 468:4, and MB 14 <em>ad loc.</em>). When a woman marries, it is as if she moves permanently into her husband's house, and she must therefore
    adopt his customs.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, if an Ashkenazic woman marries a Sephardic man, she may eat <em>kitniyot</em> during Pesah and need not perform <em>hatarat</em><em>nedarim </em>(annulment of vows) because she is acting in accordance with the law that a woman adopts the customs of her husband. Nevertheless, some    <em>poskim</em> recommend that she perform <em>hatarat</em> <em>nedarim</em>.

</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Prohibited Species
</h2>
<p>
The familiar foods included in this custom are: rice, alfalfa, peas, millet, sorghum, chickpeas, fenugreek seeds, sunflower seeds, mustard, buckwheat (    <em>kusemet, </em>not to be confused with <em>kusmin</em> - spelt - which is a forbidden cereal grain), cumin, vetch, black-eyed peas,<em> </em>arum, soy,
    mung beans, lentils, fava beans, lupin beans, poppy seeds, flaxseed, pulse, caraway, hemp seeds, common beans (<em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>), sesame seeds,
    lupine seeds, corn, clover seed, and tamarind fruit. Products made from <em>kitniyot </em>- corn flakes, corn flour, and rice cakes, for example - are also
included in the custom. Saffron was originally called "<em>karkom</em>" in Hebrew and is included in the prohibition. Turmeric, the Modern Hebrew<em>karkom</em>, is permitted. Mustard and flaxseed are not <em>kitniyot</em>, but the custom is to forbid them because they grow in pods like    <em>kitniyot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Rema writes that it is permitted to eat dill and coriander because they are not <em>kitniyot</em>. Nonetheless, Aharonim write that they must be examined
    well because they often contain wheat (MA, MB 453:13).
</p>
<p>
    There are differing customs regarding peanuts. In Jerusalem and many other places people refrain from eating them (<em>Mikra'ei</em> <em>Kodesh</em> 2:60),
but in Greater Lithuania they were customarily eaten. One who does not know whether his family was stringent in this regard may eat them (<em>Igrot</em>    <em>Moshe</em> OH 3:63).
</p>
<p>
    Potato flour is permitted on Pesah. There is no contention that based on the customary prohibition of <em>kitniyot </em>anything from which flour can be
    made should be forbidden. Rather, the custom only includes what the great Ashkenazic Rishonim forbade. Since potatoes had not yet arrived in Europe then,
    they are not included in the prohibition (<em>ibid</em>.).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
5. Rules Governing This Custom     
</h2>
<p>
    People who adhere to the custom of not eating <em>kitniyot</em> may keep them in the house during Pesah and derive benefit from them, for example, by
    lighting a lamp with <em>kitniyot</em> oil (Rema 453:1).
</p>
<p>
    One who does not eat <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesah may cook them for somebody who does, but it is recommended that he use some sort of reminder that he is not
cooking for himself (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 453:17; <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 16:8). It is likewise permissible for a storeowner to sell    <em>kitniyot</em> during Pesah; however, if there could be wheat grains among the <em>kitniyot</em> that make up more than one sixtieth of the mixture, the
    storeowner may not sell the <em>kitniyot</em>, because this could cause customers to transgress the <em>hametz</em> prohibition. It would be better to sell
    such <em>kitniyot</em> along with the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If <em>kitniyot</em> fall into a cooked food, they should be removed, and whatever cannot be removed is <em>batel</em> in the majority of the dish. If,
    however, such a large amount of <em>kitniyot</em> falls in that they become the majority, the dish is considered a <em>kitniyot</em> dish and its
    consumption is forbidden (Rema 453:1; MB 8-9 <em>ad loc.</em>).
</p>
<p>
    It is permissible for one who does not eat <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesah to eat from and cook with utensils that belong to one who does eat <em>kitniyot</em>,
    provided that 24 hours have elapsed since <em>kitniyot</em> were last cooked in them. If food was cooked in such a utensil before 24 hours elapsed, the
    food remains kosher.

<a name="5"></a><h2>
6. <em>Kitniyot</em> That Never Touched Water and <em>Kitniyot</em> Oilsi
</h2>
<p>
We are not stricter with <em>kitniyot</em> than we are with the five cereal grains, so whatever is acceptable regarding these grains is kosher for    <em>kitniyot</em>, too. Thus, <em>kitniyot</em> that have not come into contact with water, or that have come into contact with water but were not left for
    more than 18 minutes before being cooked (like matza), may be eaten. Some <em>poskim</em> are stringent in this respect, but most are lenient.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> disagree about oils and whiskeys made from <em>kitniyot</em>. Those who rule leniently contend that the <em>kitniyot</em> prohibition
does not apply to oil extracted from them, while those who rule stringently maintain that <em>kitniyot</em> oil has the same status as the    <em>kitniyot</em> themselves. There is a middle position that asserts that if the <em>kitniyot</em> had been rinsed in water (for example, as part of the
    malting process) they become forbidden, and the oil extracted from them is prohibited. However, if they are ground and made into oil without having been
    moistened, they do not have the status of <em>kitniyot</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    Soybean, cottonseed, and canola (rapeseed) oils are not included in the prohibition. Many are stringent about soybean and canola oils, but whoever wishes
    to be lenient may be so. The widespread custom regarding cottonseed oil is to be lenient.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Lecithin extracted from rapeseed and added to chocolate is not included in the <em>kitniyot</em> prohibition, though some are stringent.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
Chocolate and candy labeled "Kosher for Pesah only for those who eat <em>kitniyot</em>" are technically permissible even for those who do not eat    <em>kitniyot</em>, because the <em>kitniyot</em> in these products are added before Pesah and are <em>batel be-rov</em>. In addition, these products
    generally contain <em>kitniyot</em> oils, which, according to several leading <em>poskim</em>, are not included in the custom to prohibit <em>kitniyot</em>
    . In practice, however, many people are stringent in this respect, and kosher certification agencies therefore label them as kosher for Pesah only for
    those who eat <em>kitniyot</em>.

<a name="6"></a><h2>
7. Extenuating Circumstances, the Sick, and Babies
</h2>
<p>
    Clearly, the Ashkenazic custom to refrain from <em>kitniyot </em>cannot be stricter than the prohibition against <em>hametz</em> itself. Therefore, in
    extenuating circumstances like drought or famine, leading halakhic<em> </em>authorities permitted eating <em>kitniyot</em>. In actuality, rabbis have often
    disagreed whether the need was pressing enough to permit eating <em>kitniyot</em>. Some rabbis were inclined to be lenient, others to be stringent, and
    still others to permit <em>kitniyot </em>to the poor alone, requiring the wealthy to buy other types of foods. On such matters, one must follow the ruling
    of the accepted local rabbinic authorities.
</p>
<p>
    Some Aharonim write that when applying these leniencies to <em>kitniyot</em>, it is better first to permit <em>kitniyot</em> that do not resemble cereal
    grain, and only permit rice, millet, and buckwheat when there is no choice (<em>Nishmat Adam</em>). Additionally, some Aharonim state that when applying
    these leniencies, one should first scald the <em>kitniyot </em>in boiling water, since scalding prevents even cereal grains from becoming <em>hametz</em>.
    Even though in practice we do not permit scalding cereal grains on Pesah, when it is necessary to be lenient with <em>kitniyot</em>, it is best to take
    precautions as much as possible (<em>Hatam</em> <em>Sofer</em> OH ï¿½122; MB 453:7).
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    One who is ill and needs to eat <em>kitniyot</em> may do so, even if he is not dangerously ill. For example, one may swallow flaxseed with water as a
    laxative. One may likewise feed rice to children who need it (<em>Hayei</em> <em>Adam</em> 127:6), though special utensils should be set aside for this.
    Anytime one acts leniently, the <em>kitniyot</em> should be thoroughly inspected to ensure that they contain no cereal grains.

            Editor's note: we have refrained from translating the term "<em>kitniyot</em>" since there is no precise equivalent in English, and an imprecise
            translation would be misleading. In earlier contexts (such as the laws of <em>kilayim</em>, which prohibit cultivating dissimilar species in close
            proximity), <em>kitniyot </em>referred specifically to members of the legume family. As currently used, the category of <em>kitniyot </em>includes
            species that are not legumes, and not every member of the legume family is considered <em>kitniyot</em>.

            . <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 1:158 proves that this is a Torah law from the fact that the Torah exempts a married woman from the obligation to honor
            her parents, since this mitzva would require her to actively clothe and feed her parents if necessary, and her obligations to her household take
            priority (SA<em> </em>YD 240:17; obviously if there is no clash between the two obligations, she is commanded to honor her parents). Thus,
            according to the Torah, a woman's place is in her husband's home.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Igrot Moshe </em>
            also asserts that she need not perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em>. MB 468:14 states that one who moves from one locale to another must behave
            according to the custom of the new place. It is implied that since this is the <em>halakha</em>, there is no need for <em>hatarat nedarim</em>.
            This is also the opinion of <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 468:43. Additionally, in extenuating circumstances even Ashkenazic communities did not accept the
            custom of refraining from <em>kitniyot</em> and can therefore be lenient in situations of famine or sickness (MB<em> </em>453:7). Similarly, two
different customs in one household would certainly cause tension, and thus she changes her custom without performing <em>hatarat nedarim</em>.            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 16:13 states that she must perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em>, and <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> (p.<em> </em>56 and n. 10)
            states that it is better to perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            May Ashkenazim perform <em>hatarat nedarim </em>and eat <em>kitniyot</em>?
            <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em>
            453:15 states that according to Mahari Levi (ï¿½38), one who refrained from eating <em>kitniyot</em> because he thought they are <em>hametz</em> may
perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em>, but one who knew, or whose ancestors knew, that <em>kitniyot</em> is merely a stringent custom may not perform            <em>hatarat nedarim</em>. Thus, Ashkenazim may not perform <em>hatarat nedarim </em>and eat <em>kitniyot</em>. According to <em>Pri Hadash </em>
            ï¿½468, one need not perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em> to annul a custom that originated in a mistake, so even one who knew that <em>kitniyot</em> is
            just a stringent custom may annul his vow and eat <em>kitniyot</em>. However, we need to examine whether he would apply this reasoning to a custom
accepted by an entire community; perhaps even according to <em>Pri Hadash</em> <em>hatarat nedarim</em> would not be effective in such a case.<em>Hatam Sofer </em>OH ï¿½122 upholds the opinion of Mahari Levi. This is in fact the customary practice: we find that Ashkenazim do not perform            <em>hatarat nedarim </em>and eat <em>kitniyot</em> except in the case of a sick person. <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 16 n. 47 and in the
            addenda quotes some who believe that <em>kitniyot</em> originated as an enactment ("<em>gezeira</em>"). According to this, even an Ashkenazic woman
            who marries a Sephardic man would not be permitted to eat <em>kitniyot</em>. Nevertheless, we do not follow this opinion, and an Ashkenazic woman
            should follow her husband's customs.

. <em>Kitniyot</em> in a mixture are <em>batel </em>in a simple majority (<em>batel be-rov</em>). Although the implication of<em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> is that it is only <em>batel be-shishim</em>, the Aharonim rule that it is <em>batel be-rov</em> (SAH 453:5;            <em>Hayei Adam</em> 127:1; <em>Havot Ya'ir</em> ï¿½6; <em>Eliya Rabba</em> ï¿½4; and <em>Kaf Ha-hayim </em>453:25, which also adds more sources). All
            of this only applies when one found that <em>kitniyot </em>had been mixed with permissible food, but it is forbidden to mix <em>kitniyot</em> with
            permissible food intentionally, contrary to the opinion of the <em>Pri Hadash</em> that one may intentionally add <em>kitniyot</em> to a mixture as
            long as they do not become the majority of the mixture. If one who does not eat <em>kitniyot</em> visits one who does eat <em>kitniyot</em> and
there is nothing else for the guest to eat, he may, if absolutely necessary, eat the non-<em>kitniyot</em> food from a mixture containing            <em>kitniyot</em>. For example, he may eat potatoes and zucchini from a dish containing <em>kitniyot</em>, even though the food he is eating
            absorbed some flavor from the <em>kitniyot.</em>
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Even those who abstain from <em>kitniyot</em> are permitted to eat food cooked in a pot in which <em>kitniyot</em> had been cooked within the prior
            24 hours, since the taste of the <em>kitniyot</em> is a very small minority. If 24 hours elapsed since the cooking of the <em>kitniyot</em>, one
may cook food in the pot even <em>le-khathila</em>, since the taste of the <em>kitniyot</em> in the pot has already turned foul, and            <em>kitniyot</em> are technically kosher for Pesah anyway (<em>Pri Hadash </em>496:24 and <em>Responsa Maharalbah</em> ï¿½121). If one is in doubt
            whether or not 24 hours passed since the cooking of the <em>kitniyot</em>, he may still use the pot <em>le-khathila </em>because of the principle
            that most pots have not been used in the past 24 hours. See also <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 453:27, which lists additional sources.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Some maintain that the prohibition of <em>kitniyot</em> begins at the onset of Pesah (<em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato </em>16:10 n. 42), and in time of
            pressing need one can rely on this opinion. In practice, however, the mainstream opinion is that the custom of <em>kitniyot</em> corresponds to the
prohibition of <em>hametz</em>. Thus, <em>kitniyot </em>are forbidden from the time that <em>hametz</em> is prohibited (<em>Hok Yaakov</em> 471:2;            <em>Responsa Maharsham</em> 1:183; <em>Shevet Ha-Levi</em> 3, 31).

. Most authorities are not stricter about <em>kitniyot</em> than about the cereal grains (SAH 453:5; <em>Hayei Adam</em> 127:1;            <em>Responsa Maharsham </em>1:183; <em>Be'er Yitzhak</em> ï¿½11; <em>Responsa </em><em>Marheshet</em> ï¿½3; and Rav Kook's <em>Orah Mishpat</em> ï¿½111).
            Some, however, are more stringent (<em>Sho'el U-meishiv</em> 1:1:175 and <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> ï¿½32). Their rationale is that no one would
understand these distinctions since <em>kitniyot</em> do not become <em>hametz</em>. Additionally, they were concerned that making the            <em>kitniyot</em> exactly like the cereal grains would mislead people to think they could use <em>kitniyot </em>to fulfill the mitzva of matza. As
            noted, though, most <em>poskim</em> are lenient, and in any dispute about a custom the <em>halakha</em> follows the lenient opinion.

            The Rishonim also debate whether or not scalding works for <em>kitniyot</em>, since scalding any of the five cereal grains technically eliminates
the possibility of its leavening, though the Ge'onim agree that no one knows how to scald the grains properly (SA 454:3). However, according to            <em>Or Zaru'a</em> 2:256, since the prohibition of <em>kitniyot</em> is just a custom, scalding the <em>kitniyot</em> is effective and permits
            them. <em>Mordechai </em>rules stringently, and Rabbeinu Peretz's glosses to <em>Smak</em> ï¿½222 notes the lenient opinion but rules stringently.

            . <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> ï¿½113 explains that oil extracted from <em>kitniyot</em> is prohibited because the <em>kitniyot</em> are first malted.
            This is also the opinion of Rema 453:1. The implication of <em>Terumat Ha-deshen </em>is that if the <em>kitniyot</em> were not malted, their oil
would be permitted. R. Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor in <em>Responsa</em> <em>Be'er Yitzhak</em> ï¿½11 rules even more leniently, explaining that if the            <em>kitniyot </em>were checked to ensure that no grain seeds were mixed in, the oil extracted from them is permitted, since the act of checking
proves that the person is familiar with the prohibition. Similarly, <em>Responsa</em> <em>Emek Halakha</em> ï¿½134 permits whiskey distilled from            <em>kitniyot</em>, as the prohibition applies to <em>kitniyot</em> themselves, not the liquid extracted from them.
        </p>
        <p>
Conversely, other Aharonim maintain that oil extracted from <em>kitniyot </em>is prohibited even when the <em>kitniyot </em>are not malted (            <em>Nishmat Adam</em> ï¿½33 and <em>Avnei Nezer </em>OH ï¿½373). However, <em>Terumat Ha-deshen</em> and Rema imply that such oil is permissible. This
            raises an apparent difficulty, since the oil will eventually be mixed with water, a process that would be forbidden to apply to grain. Thus,
            according to these authorities, the custom is to prohibit <em>kitniyot </em>in their seed and flour state, but not in their oil state. One need not
            be concerned that grain kernels got mixed in with the <em>kitniyot</em>, which would turn to <em>hametz</em> when the extracted oil is mixed with
            water, since any oil extracted from the grain is <em>batel be-shishim </em>and is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or </em>on Pesah (SA<em> </em>447:4).
            Additionally, it appears that even liquid that is exuded by grain does not become <em>hametz</em>, as explained in <em>Orah Mishpat</em> ï¿½ï¿½111-112
            and <em>Responsa </em><em>Marheshet</em> ï¿½3. <em>Tzemah Tzedek</em> permits this for poor people, provided that the <em>kitniyot</em> did not come
            into contact with water while in seed form.

            Rav Kook has a well-known ruling (<em>Orah Mishpat </em>108-114) in which he broadly permitted sesame oil since not only are the seeds not malted,
but the oil is also fried, which would prevent cereal grain from becoming <em>hametz</em> and is certainly enough to alleviate the problem of            <em>kitniyot.</em> This idea is echoed by <em>Avnei Nezer </em>OH ï¿½533 with regard to rapeseed oil (this responsum appeared in 5458, 11 years
            before Rav Kook's responsum). The Hasidic-Ashkenazic rabbinical court in Jerusalem vociferously opposed Rav Kook without any regard for the honor
            of Torah or of all of the <em>poskim</em> who had previously ruled even more leniently than Rav Kook on this matter. Rav Kook responded to them
            sharply, with erudition, and with strong proofs. As part of his response, he wrote (p. 123): "In truth, the path of my righteous and ingenious
            mentors, may their merit protect us and all of Israel, whom I merited to serve, was not to incline toward stringency when it was possible to be
            lenient, especially regarding issues without a strong basis in the words of the talmudic Sages. It is sufficient that we do not budge, God forbid,
            from the customs we accepted at the guidance of our rabbis, the <em>poskim</em>. But as for the details that can be argued one way or the other,
            certainly one who inclines toward a lenient ruling in an effort to be wise and benevolent is praiseworthy, as long as his words are based on the
            profundity of <em>halakha</em> and sound reasoning..." Furthermore, one who adds prohibitions to a prohibition that is not rooted in the law may
violate a prohibition implied by a positive commandment ("<em>lav ha-ba mi-khlal aseh</em>") according to Rashi's comments in the first chapter of            <em>Beitza</em>. As Rav Kook wrote (p. 126): "That which the Talmud often states, that we do not make decrees on top of other decrees, is derived
            from the following verse: 'You shall safeguard my observances' ['<em>u-shmartem et mishmarti</em>' - Vayikra 18:30]: make safeguards, i.e., enact
            decrees, for my observances, that is, for the Torah. But do not make safeguards for safeguards; do not make decrees upon decrees." Against the
            claim that we must be increasingly stringent nowadays, Rav Kook writes: "I know the character of our contemporaries well: it is precisely when they
            see that everything that can be permitted based on the profundity of <em>halakha</em> is permitted, they will understand that when we do not permit
            it is based on the truth of Torah law. Consequently, many people will adhere to the Torah and heed the words of the Sages, God willing. On the
            other hand, when they discover that there are things that can be permitted according to the letter of the law, but the rabbis were not sensitive to
            the travails and hardships of the Jewish people and leave these matters in their prohibited state, it will cause a terrible desecration of God's
            name, Heaven forbid. Ultimately, there will be an increase of outbursts saying about core elements of the Torah that if the rabbis want to permit
            it, they can; thus, the law will be perverted" (p. 126).

            . Soybean oil is produced without moistening the soybeans, so according to Rav Kook and most <em>poskim</em> it is not forbidden. Furthermore, it
            is questionable whether soybeans were even included in the prohibition of <em>kitniyot</em>, since they did not arrive in Europe until about 100
            years ago. <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OH 3:63 writes that only what has customarily been accepted as prohibited is included in the custom. This is also
            the opinion of R. Dov Lior, the rabbi and head of the rabbinical court in Kiryat Arba.

Regarding cottonseed oil, <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh </em>2:60 is lenient, citing a ruling attributed to R. Hayim Soloveitchik of Brisk.            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> (16:4) rules leniently in the name of R. Moshe Feinstein. However, <em>Minhat Hinukh</em> 3:138 is stringent.

            Peanut Oil
            : We learned in section 4 above that in Greater Lithuania the custom was to eat peanuts, as per <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OH <em> </em>3:63, since only
            items that are known not to have been eaten because of <em>kitniyot </em>are prohibited. Peanuts, which were discovered later on, were not included
            in the original prohibition. On the other hand, <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> 2:60 and <em>Helkat Yaakov</em> ï¿½97 prohibit peanuts but permit peanut
oil. This is also the opinion of <em>Melamed Le-ho'il </em>OH ï¿½88. <em>Seridei Esh</em> 2:37 also echoes this idea, and quotes that            <em>Avnei Nezer </em>OH ï¿½383 prohibited peanut oil, as did <em>Minhat Elazar</em>. Practically, if one is unaware of a family custom to be
            stringent, he may be lenient, since this is an unclear custom.

            . The Badatz is strict about lecithin derived from rapeseed. Halakhically there is nothing wrong with this substance; however, there are many
uncertainties that mitigate toward leniency. Firstly, rapeseed is not a legume (the technical meaning of <em>kitniyot</em>), but a member of the            <em>Brassicaceae</em> family of crucifers, whose fruit grips the stalk and whose seeds grow in pods, much like the mustard plant. Oil is extracted
            from these seeds. According to <em>Igrot Moshe </em>OH 3:63, we do not forbid anything that was not explicitly prohibited by custom. Additionally,
it is debatable whether the status of <em>kitniyot</em> can be applied to the seeds of a plant when it is clear that the plant itself is not            <em>kitniyot</em>. However, according to <em>Avnei Nezer </em>OH ï¿½373, rapeseed oil is considered <em>kitniyot</em>, just like mustard (although
            even according to <em>Avnei Nezer</em>, if one boiled the seeds they would be permissible, as explained in ï¿½533). Moreover, we already saw that
            there are opinions that permit oil produced from any type of <em>kitniyot</em>. According to <em>Maharsham</em> 1:183, rapeseed oil is kosher for
            Pesah since the oil is extracted without malting the seeds, and we have seen that most <em>poskim</em> are lenient in these situations, akin to the
            case of sesame oil. Finally, the oil is <em>batel be-rov </em>before Pesah. According to <em>Be'er Yitzhak</em>, any oil that was added to a
            mixture before Pesah is <em>batel</em>. Ultimately, when there are so many uncertainties regarding a custom, we rule leniently. This is the ruling
            of R. Mordechai Eliyahu, as cited in <em>Responsa </em><em>Ama Devar</em> 1:62.

            . According to Rema 453:1 and MB<em> </em>9 <em>ad loc.</em>, even if <em>kitniyot</em> were mixed in on Pesah, they are <em>batel be-rov</em>,
            although clearly one may not do so <em>le-khathila</em>. In this case, the mixing took place before Pesah, and not for the purpose of nullifying
            the prohibited ingredients in the majority of permissible ingredients, since they may be eaten according to Sephardic custom. Therefore, since they
were <em>batel be-rov </em>before Pesah, the mixture may be eaten on Pesah. Additionally, R. Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor writes in            <em>Be'er Yitzhak</em> ï¿½11 (quoted in n. 4 above) that the prohibition of <em>kitniyot</em> does not apply to <em>kitniyot </em>oil that was
            checked before Pesah. This is the opinion of R. Lior and R. Rabinovitch.
        </p>
        <p>
R. Lior also rules that string beans and fava beans in their pods are kosher for Pesah, since in this state they are considered vegetables and not            <em>kitniyot</em>. They were never included in the original prohibition since all of the concerns that were mentioned as the reason for the custom
            of <em>kitniyot</em> never applied to them.

. <em>Hayei Adam </em>(127:1) permits eating <em>kitniyot</em> in truly extenuating circumstances, like if one has nothing else to eat. See also<em>Nishmat Adam</em> ï¿½20 and <em>Mor U-ketzi'a</em> (which assert that ideally the custom of <em>kitniyot</em> should be abolished altogether).            <em>Ha-m</em><em>o'adim Be-halakha</em>'s chapter on <em>kitniyot </em>states that <em>Teshuva Me-ahava, Ma'amar Mordechai, </em>and Mahariz Enzil
maintain that one may not eat <em>kitniyot</em> even in an extreme situation. Conversely, Maharam Padua<em> </em>of Brisk (ï¿½48) permits            <em>kitniyot</em> in extenuating circumstances. <em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 1:28 and <em>Sho'el U-meishiv </em>2:4:158 rule leniently for poor people
only. <em>Hatam Sofer </em>OH <em> </em>ï¿½122 does not oppose the lenient authorities but notes that they should require scalding the            <em>kitniyot</em> before eating. <em>Nishmat Adam</em> ï¿½20 states that one should first permit <em>kitniyot</em> that do not resemble cereal grain,
and only as a last option permit those that resemble grain. MB states that one may certainly be lenient in extenuating circumstances and cites            <em>Hatam Sofer</em> and <em>Hayei Adam</em> that scalding is required before eating. AHS 453:5 states: "They explicitly accepted that if there
            would be famine and the poor would be starving for food, all of the local sages, led by the chief rabbi, would permit <em>kitniyot</em> on that
            Pesah."
