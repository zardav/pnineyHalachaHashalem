        1. The Basis of the Prohibition
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages prohibited moving things that are not fitting for Shabbat and
        that one puts out of his mind (<em>maktzeh mi-da’ato</em>). There are
        two fundamental reasons for this prohibition: 1) to preserve the
        atmosphere of Shabbat as a day of holiness and rest. The idea of rest
        applies to one’s hands as well; they should not move objects or be
        involved with activities that are not connected to Shabbat; 2) to set
        up a safeguard so that one will not come to do <em>melakha</em> on
        Shabbat. We will begin by explaining the first reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited on Shabbat,
        the Torah commands us to rest and relax on Shabbat, as it states: "but
        on the seventh day you shall cease, so that your ox and your donkey may
        rest, and the son of your maidservant and the stranger may be
        refreshed" (Shemot 23:12). Similarly, we read: "Six days shall work be
        done, but on the seventh day there shall be a Shabbat of complete rest,
        holy to the Lord" (Shemot 31:15). In order to fulfill the Torah
        commandment to rest and relax on Shabbat, the Sages established several
        ordinances meant to protect the spirit of Shabbat as a day of sanctity
        and rest. One of them is the prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If moving items unnecessary for Shabbat were permitted, people might
        well spend all of Shabbat cleaning and arranging their homes and
        belongings, thus negating the mitzva to rest. Additionally, the
        prophets instructed the people that the atmosphere of Shabbat should be
        different from that of the weekday - one should walk and talk
        differently. Following this line of thought, the Sages decreed that
        people should not handle objects and implements on Shabbat in the same
        way as during the week. This way Shabbat is truly felt by all,
        including those whose weekday activities do not normally involve any
forbidden <em>melakhot</em>. We see that the prohibition of        <em>muktzeh</em> is rooted in the words of the Torah and the prophets,
        while its precise parameters and details are rabbinic (AHS 308:4-5;
        above, 22:1).
    </p>
    <p>
As we said, the second reason is so that one will not end up doing        <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat. As with all <em>mitzvot</em>, the Sages
        instituted safeguards in order to distance people from sin. The
        prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em> makes it less likely that people will
        carry objects in the public domain or use <em>muktzeh</em> items to
        perform <em>melakha</em> (Rambam and Raavad, MT 24:12-13).

    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em> synchronizes the mind and the
        hands. Any item that one knows is not fit for use on Shabbat will not
        be touched by his hands either.
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. Principles of <em>Muktzeh</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        As a rule, the Sages forbade moving things on Shabbat that are not
        fitting for use on Shabbat and that one puts out of his mind (section
        10 below). There are several types of <em>muktzeh</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
        1) <em>Muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em> (inherently <em>muktzeh</em>) - items
        that are not fitting for any use on Shabbat, such as rocks, trees,
        sand, animals, and inedible food (as explained below, section 3).
    </p>
    <p>
        2) <em>Muktzeh maĥmat ĥesron kis</em> (<em>muktzeh </em>because of
        monetary loss) - valuable objects that one takes care not to handle
        except for their sole designated use, out of concern that they will be
        ruined. Since they have no use on Shabbat, one puts them out of his
        mind (section 4 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        3) <em>Basis le-davar ha-asur</em> (a base for a forbidden object) -
        refers to a case where one places a <em>muktzeh</em> item on an object
        that is not itself <em>muktzeh</em>; since he intends for it to remain
        there on Shabbat, he puts the "base" out of his mind as well, and it
        too becomes <em>muktzeh</em> (sections 5-6 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        4) <em>Kelim she-melakhtam le-isur </em>(implements whose usage is
        forbidden) - have a special status. Since they are designed to perform
        forbidden activities, one puts them out of his mind. On the other hand,
        sometimes they are used for permitted purposes. Therefore, one may not
move them for their own sake (e.g., to protect them,        <em>le-tzorekh atzmam</em>), but one may move them to use them
        permissibly (<em>le-tzorekh gufam</em>) or because one needs the space
        they occupy (<em>le-tzorekh mekomam</em>) (sections 7-9 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a <em>muktzeh</em> item is painfully unpleasant, like a chamber pot
        (<em>graf shel re’i</em>), the Sages permitted removing it (section 12
        below).
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition is to move a <em>muktzeh</em> object manually, but one
        may touch a <em>muktzeh</em> item without moving it. Therefore, one may
        spread a cover over a computer, telephone, or other <em>muktzeh</em>
items on Shabbat. One may also move <em>muktzeh</em> "from the side" (        <em>min ha-tzad</em>). For example, if one needs to pick up an object
        or food, and in so doing a <em>muktzeh</em> item that is next to the
        object or food will be moved indirectly, as long as he does not touch
        the <em>muktzeh</em> item with his hands, it is not prohibited.
        However, if the <em>muktzeh</em> item needs to be moved for its own
        protection, one may not move it even <em>min ha-tzad</em>. As long as
he is using his hands, even if they have no direct contact with the        <em>muktzeh</em> item (for example, if he is using a broom), it is
prohibited. However, one may use any other part of the body (<em>be-gufo</em>); for example, one may move an object that is        <em>muktzeh</em> using his foot or elbow (section 14 below).
    </p>
    <p>
Sometimes it is unclear whether or not a particular item is        <em>muktzeh</em> because we lack facts about the situation. For
        example, if one found fruit under a tree and it is uncertain whether
they fell before Shabbat (and are permitted) or on Shabbat (and are<em>muktzeh</em>), we are stringent and consider it <em>muktzeh</em> (        <em>Beitza</em> 24b; SA 325:5). In contrast, if there is a halakhic
        disagreement about whether an item is <em>muktzeh</em>, the law follows
        the lenient position (<em>Beit Yosef</em> 279:4; SHT 309:24).
    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. <em>Muktzeh Maĥmat Gufo</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
Any item that is unfit for any use on Shabbat is<em>muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em>. This means that it is inherently        <em>muktzeh</em>; because it is of no use on Shabbat, it is put out of
        one’s mind, <em>muktzeh</em>. This category includes rocks, animals,
        coins, straw, dust, trees, leaves, all types of waste, and corpses.
    </p>
    <p>
        This type of <em>muktzeh</em> may not be moved even if one wants to use
        the item for a permissible purpose. For example, one may not pick up a
        rock to use as a door stopper or nutcracker. If one wants to prevent
        the rock from becoming <em>muktzeh</em>, he must either mentally
        designate it for the desired purpose before Shabbat or use it for that
        purpose at least once during the week (SA 308:20, 22).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sand is <em>muktzeh</em> and may not be used to cover up something
        disgusting. If the sand has been put in a particular place specifically
        for this purpose, it is not <em>muktzeh</em> (SA 308:38). Similarly,
        sand in a sandbox for children is not <em>muktzeh</em> (above, 15:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        Food that may not currently be eaten, but that one intends to make
permissible after Shabbat - such as food from which <em>teruma</em> and        <em>ma’aser</em> or <em>ĥ</em><em>alla</em> have not yet been separated
        - are <em>muktzeh</em> on Shabbat (MT 25:19). However, non-kosher meat
that one intends to give to a non-Jew or feed to a dog is not        <em>muktzeh</em> (SA 324:7).
    </p>
    <p>
Foods that can be eaten under pressing circumstances are not        <em>muktzeh</em>. However, if they are not edible at all without being
        cooked or baked - such as flour, potatoes, beans, raw meat, and raw
        fish - they are <em>muktzeh</em>. Even though animals can eat them,
        they are still <em>muktzeh</em>, since normally animals are not given
        food meant for people.
    </p>
    <p>
        In pressing circumstances, such as if a freezer has stopped working and
        the meat and fish inside are likely to spoil, we rely on the opinion
that since a dog would eat these foods raw, they are not        <em>muktzeh</em>. Accordingly, one may move them into a working
        freezer.
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Animals are <em>muktzeh</em> since they serve no purpose on Shabbat. In
        a time of need, one may take hold of them and drag them in order to
        feed or protect them, but one may not pick them up (above 20:3). House
pets, which are normally played with and picked up, are not        <em>muktzeh</em> (above 20:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        Food scraps that dogs or cats can eat are not <em>muktzeh</em>. Even if
        one does not own a cat or dog, there are cats and dogs in town that
        would be happy to have them. Similarly, bones are not <em>muktzeh</em>,
        since dogs and cats eat them. However, food scraps that neither man nor
animal will eat - such as the nutshells, husks, and fish bones - are        <em>muktzeh</em>. Additionally, if food scraps would be eaten by some
        animals but not by any found locally, they are <em>muktzeh</em> (SA
        308:29). Apricot pits that children play with and that were extracted
        on Shabbat are not <em>muktzeh</em> (see SSK ch. 16 n. 33).
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. <em>Muktzeh Maĥmat Ĥesron Kis</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Valuable items that have no use on Shabbat and that people always take
        care not to move except for the specific purpose for which they are
designed (to ensure the items do not get damaged or lost) are        <em>muktzeh ma</em><em>ĥ</em><em>mat ĥesron kis</em>. For example,
knives designed for ritual slaughter or for leatherworking are        <em>muktzeh</em>. Even if one wants to cut his food with them, he may
        not pick them up (<em>Shabbat</em> 123b, 157a; SA 308:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Included in this category of <em>muktzeh</em> are: musical instruments,
        smartphones, radios, tape recorders, expensive or fragile music
        players, cameras, and mixers. These may not be used even for a
        permissible purpose, for example, as a paperweight. Similarly, one may
        not wrap himself in an expensive piece of fabric that has been set
        aside for sewing. In contrast, a valuable or fragile item that is
        frequently used on Shabbat, such as a gold watch, eyeglasses, or a
        magnifying glass for reading, is not <em>muktzeh</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other examples of <em>muktzeh ma</em><em>ĥ</em><em>mat ĥesron kis</em>
        are paper money, important business documents, identity cards, credit
        cards, stamps, bus tickets, parchment to be used by a scribe, and
        stationery paper that is not used for any other purpose (SSK 20:20).
    </p>
    <p>
        Wall clocks and valuable pictures, which people are careful not to move
so as to avoid possible damage, are included in this category of        <em>muktzeh </em>(MB 308:168). Also included are large free-standing
        closets that people are careful not to move without a good reason, for
        fear that they will fall apart (MB 308:8). The prohibition here is
        limited to moving the entire closet; one may open its doors and
        drawers, as they are meant to be used regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
Cups, plates, and clothes that are meant to be sold are        <em>muktzeh</em> <em>ma</em><em>ĥ</em><em>mat ĥesron kis</em>, since
        sellers usually insist that no one use them. If a seller does not
        insist upon this, his wares are not <em>muktzeh</em>. People who sell
        food generally do not insist that no one eat from their merchandise,
        and therefore the food in stores and warehouses is not <em>muktzeh</em>
        (<em>Beit Yosef</em> and Rema 308:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 6-7; SA 310:2;
        MB <em>ad loc.</em> 4).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. <em>Basis Le-davar Ha-asur</em> and Conscious Placement
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a <em>muktzeh</em> item was placed atop a non-<em>muktzeh</em> item
        with the intention that it stay there all of Shabbat, then the
permitted item becomes <em>muktzeh</em>, as it serves as a        <em>basis</em> (base) for a forbidden object. For example, if one
placed money on a table, then even though the table is not in itself        <em>muktzeh</em>, since he placed <em>muktzeh</em> money on it, the
table becomes <em>muktzeh</em> because it is now a <em>basis</em>        <em>le-davar ha-asur</em>. In other words, the decision to place money
        on the table implies consent not to use the table on Shabbat, making
        the table <em>muktzeh</em> just like the money on it. Even if the money
        were to fall off during Shabbat, it would not matter; since the table
was <em>muktzeh</em> during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, it remains        <em>muktzeh</em> all of Shabbat (SA 310:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, if one did not intend for the money to stay on the table
        over Shabbat but simply left it there by mistake, then the table does
not become <em>muktzeh</em>, since he did not decide to make it a<em>basis</em> for something <em>muktzeh</em>. Nevertheless,<em>le-khatĥila</em> one should still not move the table while the        <em>muktzeh </em>item is on it. Rather, he should tilt the table so
        that the money falls off and then move the table wherever he wants.
        However, if the <em>muktzeh</em> item would be damaged if it slid
        offupon falling to the floor, then one may move the table along with
        the <em>muktzeh </em>item to a place where the latter<em> </em>can
safely be slid off without being damaged. For example, if the        <em>muktzeh</em> item is a smartphone, which would likely break if
dropped, one may move the table elsewhere. Similarly, if the        <em>muktzeh</em> item is a stone, and next to the table are fragile
        glass items that would likely break if the stone were to fall on them,
        one may move the table elsewhere (<em>Shabbat</em> 142b; SA 309:4; SA
        277:3; section 14 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        The same applies to a laptop left on top of a book, valuable
        candlesticks left on a tray, valuable knives left in a case, raw
potatoes left in a drawer, or a <em>tzedaka</em> box left on the        <em>bima</em>. If these items were intentionally placed there, then
whatever they are resting upon becomes a        <em>basis le-davar ha-asur</em> and is <em>muktzeh</em>. If they were
        forgotten there, the base does not become <em>muktzeh</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
Sometimes, during the week, one wishes to place something        <em>muktzeh</em> in a closet, but because there is no space he puts it
        on top of clothing in the closet. There is a disagreement whether such
        a placement renders the clothing <em>muktzeh</em>. Some say that since
        ultimately the <em>muktzeh</em> was consciously placed atop the
        clothing, the clothing becomes a <em>basis</em> (<em>Taz</em>). Others
        maintain that since the person did not intend for the <em>muktzeh</em>
        to be there specifically, but it simply ended up there, the item of
        clothing does not become a <em>basis</em> (MA). In practice, when
        necessary one may be lenient (MB 309:18).
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If one finds money or other <em>muktzeh</em> items in his pocket, he
may assume they were forgotten there, so his clothes do not become a<em>basis</em>. However, in order that he not continue to carry around        <em>muktzeh</em> in his pocket, he should try to shake it out. If he is
embarrassed to do so in public, or if he is worried that the        <em>muktzeh</em> item will get lost, he may continue to wear this item
of clothing until he reaches a place where he can shake out the        <em>muktzeh</em> without fear of losing it or embarrassing himself.

        6. More on <em>Basis Le-davar Ha-asur</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
If an assortment of items have been placed on a tray or table, some        <em>muktzeh</em> and some not, the <em>muktzeh</em> status of the tray
depends upon which items one considers to be more important. If the<em>muktzeh</em> items are more important, then the tray becomes a        <em>basis</em>. If the non-<em>muktzeh</em> items are more important,
        the tray does not become a <em>basis</em> and is not <em>muktzeh</em>
        (SA 310:8). For example, let us say the Shabbat candles and the
        challahs are on the table. If the candlesticks are made of clay, the
        challahs are more important, and the table may be moved. However, if
the candlesticks are silver (which makes them <em>muktzeh</em>        <em>ma</em><em>ĥmat</em> <em>ĥesron</em> <em>kis</em>), they are more
        important than the challahs; the table becomes a <em>basis</em> and may
        not be moved.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If one left a <em>muktzeh</em> item on top of something belonging to
        his friend, he has not rendered it a <em>basis</em>; as a general rule,
        one cannot render someone else’s possession forbidden without
        permission. However, if he acted at his friend’s behest or he knows
that his friend wished it to be done, then he has rendered it a        <em>basis</em> (Rema 309:4; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 27).
    </p>
    <p>
Even when the <em>basis</em> is much more expensive than the<em>muktzeh</em> item placed upon it, it still takes on its<em>muktzeh</em> status, since it serves as its base. However, when the<em>muktzeh</em> item is of no importance compared to the        <em>basis</em> on which it was placed, the <em>basis</em> does not
        become <em>muktzeh</em>. Therefore, if one left small change on a table
        or bones on a plate, since the <em>muktzeh </em>item is negligible
        vis-à-vis the table or plate, they do not become a <em>basis</em>.
Similarly, if the main function of the <em>basis</em> is not to be a        <em>basis</em> - for example, if the door of a closet or refrigerator
        is attached to drawers that contain <em>muktzeh</em><em> </em>objects -
        since the main function of the door is to open the closet or
        refrigerator and not to be a <em>basis</em> for what is in the drawers,
        the door does not become a <em>basis</em> (MB 310:31, 277:7; SSK
        20:77).
    </p>
    <p>
        A table that has become a <em>basis</em> may not be moved, but it may
        be used for eating or studying, as long as it is not moved. One may
        also expand the table or shorten it, as long as he does not use his
        hands to move the part of the table that has the <em>muktzeh</em> item
        on it. If the table has drawers, they may be used as well, as long as
        the table itself is not moved (<em>Tehila Le-David</em> 310:7; SSK
        20:61).

        7. <em>Kelim She-melakhtam Le-isur</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em>
        are objects normally used for activities that are prohibited on
        Shabbat. Some examples are hammers, scissors, needles, pliers, and
        phone books. Since they are designed for things that are prohibited on
        Shabbat, they are <em>muktzeh</em>. Nevertheless, since they can be
        used for permissible activities as well, one does not put them out of
        his mind completely over Shabbat. Therefore, the Sages established an
intermediate category for such items. On the one hand, they are        <em>muktzeh</em>, and one may not move them even if they were left in a
        place where they are likely to be damaged or stolen. On the other hand,
one may move them in two cases: <em>le-tzorekh gufam</em><em> </em>or        <em> le-tzorekh mekomam</em> (SA 308:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Le-tzorekh gufo</em></strong>
(pl. "<em>gufam</em>")<em> </em>means using the        <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> to do something permissible, like
        using a hammer to crack nuts, scissors to open a milk bag, a needle to
        remove a thorn, pliers to open and shut a faucet whose handle is
        missing, and a telephone book to look up an address. If the same goal
        can be attained without using a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>, it
        should not be used (MB 308:12).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Le-tzorekh mekomo</em></strong>
(pl. "<em>mekomam</em>")<em> </em>means moving the        <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> to use the space it occupies. Thus,
        if such an object was left on the table one wishes to eat at, the bed
        he wishes to lie in, or a chair he wishes to sit upon, he may move it.
        Similarly, if such an item was left on the floor in a spot where people
        will likely trip over it, one may move it. If the door of a washing
machine was left open and is getting in the way, it may be closed. If a        <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> makes it difficult to open or close a
        window, it may be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
Once the <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> has been picked up, whether        <em>le-tzorekh gufo </em>or<em> le-tzorekh mekomo</em>, one may move it
        to where it will be safe (SA 308:3; section 15 below).

        Other examples of <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em> are: pens,
        pencils, pencil sharpeners, paintbrushes, lined paper, accounting
        forms, sandpaper, carbon paper, candles, matches, nails, and
        cigarettes.

    </p>
    <p>
        Some <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em>, such as an artist’s knives
or a diamond cutter’s tools, are considered        <em>muktzeh maĥmat ĥesron kis</em>, since their owners are careful not
        to use them for other purposes. The laws pertaining to them are
stricter - they may not be moved even <em>le-tzorekh gufam </em>or        <em>le-tzorekh mekomam</em> (see section 4 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Electrical appliances</strong>
        such as fans, washing machines, refrigerators, and other appliances
with no incandescent filament are considered        <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em>. Electrical appliances with a
        heating element or incandescent filament, such as light bulbs, heaters,
        radiators, and warming trays (<em>plata</em><em>s</em>) that were on
        during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> on Friday (when Shabbat started) are
        considered <em>muktzeh maĥmat gufam</em> and may not be moved during
Shabbat even <em>le-tzorekh gufam</em><em> </em>or<em>le-tzorekh mekomam</em>. In contrast, if they were off throughout<em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, they are considered<em>kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em> and may be moved        <em>le-tzorekh gufam </em>or <em>le-tzorekh mekomam</em>.

        8. <em>Kelim </em>with<em> </em>Both Permitted and Prohibited Uses
    </h2>
    <p>
        The status of <em>kelim</em> used for both permissible and forbidden
activities is determined by the majority of their use (        <em>Pri Megadim</em>; MB 308:10). Therefore, a pocket knife with
        scissors is not <em>muktzeh</em>, because most of its blades can be
        used as cutlery for eating and are not <em>muktzeh</em>, and it is only
        the scissors that are used primarily for a forbidden activity.
Similarly, a wristwatch with a built-in calculator is not        <em>muktzeh</em>, because its primary use - telling time - is permitted
        on Shabbat. In contrast, a cell phone (that is not a smart phone) that
        displays the time is a <em>keli she-melakhto le-isur</em>,<em> </em>
        since its main use - as a telephone - is prohibited on Shabbat.
Therefore, it may not be moved for its own sake, but it may be moved        <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em> - in order to see what time it is (however, he
        should not carry it around in his pocket for that purpose). It may also
        be moved <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em>. Thus, if one wants to use the
        place where the phone is resting, it may be moved. Similarly, if the
        phone’s alarm goes off, and the owner wants to move it so the ringing
        will not disturb his rest, he may do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        A pot is a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>, since its primary purpose
        is for cooking. Nevertheless, when there is food in it, the pot is
        secondary to the food, and therefore may be moved. Once the food has
        been removed from the pot, one may remove the pot from the table, even
        if one does not need the space it is occupying. The reason is that the
        food waste at the bottom of the pot renders it disgusting, and a
        disgusting item (<em>graf shel re’i</em>) may be moved (MB 308:20; BHL
        s.v. "kli"; see section 12 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if an oven is used to store baking pans and baked goods, since its
        primary purpose is baking, it is a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>.
        Nevertheless, one may open its door to remove food, since this is
        moving it <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em>. If one wishes to put food in the
        oven and keep it there on Shabbat, he may open the door and close it,
        because this is <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em> (SSK 20:79).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Tefilin</em>
        are considered a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>,<em> </em>since one
        may not wear them on Shabbat and Yom Tov (SA 31:1). Therefore, they may
be moved only <em>le-tzorekh gufam </em>or<em> le-tzorekh mekomam</em>.<em>Le-tzorekh gufam</em> would apply if one wishes to put the        <em>tefilin</em> on, in the hope that they will protect him from
        danger. <em>Le-tzorekh mekomam</em> would apply if they are sitting in
their bag together with a <em>talit</em>, and one wishes to remove the<em>tefilin</em> in order to get to the <em>talit</em> on Shabbat (<em>Taz</em>; MA). Under pressing circumstances, if the        <em>tefilin</em> are in danger of being damaged, they may be moved (MB
        31:2; BHL <em>ad loc.</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        A flower pot is a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>, since it is
        associated with several <em>melakhot</em> - planting, watering, and
        picking. Thus, it may be moved<em> le-tzorekh gufo</em> - to decorate
        the table - or <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em> - to use the place where the
        flower pot is sitting (see above 19:10).

        9. <em>Kelim She-melakhtam Le-heter</em>, Food, and Books
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Kelim</em>
that are used for permitted purposes (        <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-heter</em>), a category that includes
        tables, chairs, beds, pillows, thermoses, clocks, and brooms, may be
        moved for any reason, though one may not move them for no reason at
        all. In Neĥemia’s time, when people failed to observe Shabbat, the
        Sages decreed that no <em>kelim</em> should be moved at all. When
meticulous observance was restored, they permitted moving        <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-heter</em> but left the decree in place for
        moving them for no reason. The idea was for people to pay attention to
what they do with their hands on Shabbat. Making sure not to move        <em>kelim</em> without a reason keeps people aware of Shabbat and makes
        it more likely that they will not end up transgressing any Shabbat
        prohibitions. Furthermore, on Shabbat one aspires to inner peace and
        restfulness. This includes one’s hands as well - they should be at
        rest, not busy moving and carrying things unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, no decree ever limited the movement of food, books,
        clothes, or jewelry. Because they make Shabbat enjoyable, one may move
        them even without a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree regarding <em>kelim</em> that are used
        very frequently, such as cutlery, plates, and cups. According to some,
        these <em>kelim</em> possess the same halakhic status as food and may
        thus be moved for no reason. Others maintain that they have the same
        status as <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-heter</em>, which may not be moved
        without a reason. Since <em>muktzeh</em> is itself a rabbinic law, the
        lenient position is the primary one. <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, though,
        since many <em>poskim</em> are inclined to be stringent, it is
        preferable to take their opinion into account and to avoid moving
        cutlery and dishes for no reason.

10. An Item that was <em>Muktzeh</em> Throughout        <em>Bein Ha-shmashot</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        If an item was <em>muktzeh</em> throughout <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> on
        Friday, it remains <em>muktzeh</em> throughout Shabbat, even if the
        reason it was considered <em>muktzeh</em> no longer applies. Therefore,
if one left money on a table before Shabbat, the table becomes        <em>muktzeh</em> as a <em>basis le-davar ha-asur</em>. Even if the
money falls off the table at some point on Shabbat, the table remains<em>muktzeh</em>, since it was <em>muktzeh</em> during        <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> (SA 310:7; section 5 above). Similarly, if an
        oil lamp or a candle was lit before Shabbat, it may not be moved on
        Shabbat even after it has burned out, and its leftover oil or wax may
not be used. Since it was <em>muktzeh</em> during        <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, it is <em>muktzeh</em> for the whole day (SA
279:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 1). So too, if a valuable item that was        <em>muktzeh maĥmat ĥesron kis </em>broke into usable pieces during
Shabbat, the pieces remain <em>muktzeh</em>, since the item was        <em>muktzeh</em> during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> (MB 308:35 following
        MA 308:19).
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing is <em>muktzeh</em> unless it meets two conditions:
    </p>
    <p>
        1) The object was not fit for use during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> on
        Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
        2) One has put the idea of using it out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Talmud’s classic example is figs and grapes that were left to dry
        on the <em>muktzeh</em> (an open space in a back yard). During the
        drying process, they are inedible because they are fermenting, so one
        puts them out of his mind. Even if the drying process is completed on
Shabbat and they become edible, since they were <em>muktzeh</em> at        <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, they remain <em>muktzeh</em> for all of
        Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
However, if only one of these conditions is met, the item is not        <em>muktzeh</em> for all of Shabbat. For example, one may have left
        wheat on the ground to take root, and has put it out of his mind. Since
        in fact the wheat was still edible during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, it
        does not become <em>muktzeh</em>, and may be picked up on Shabbat and
        eaten (SA 310:2).
    </p>
    <p>
Similarly, if one knows that an item that was unusable during        <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> will become usable on Shabbat, he does not
truly put it out of his mind. Therefore, it does not become        <em>muktzeh</em>. For example, if a pot is on the <em>plata</em> when
        Shabbat starts, even if the food is inedible at that point,
        nevertheless since one knows that it will be ready to eat later, he
        does not put it out of his mind. Similarly, if damp clothes were hung
out to dry before Shabbat, even though they are not wearable during        <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, as long as the climate is such that they
        will definitely dry over the course of Shabbat, one does not put them
out of his mind. Therefore, one may move them once they are dry (        <em>Levushei Serad</em>; SSK 22:11).

    <a name="11"></a><h2>
11<em>. </em>Making an Item Unsuitable for Its Normal Usage on Shabbat        <em></em>
    </h2>
    <p>
One may not cause an object to become unsuitable for its normal usage (        <em>levatel kli me-heikhano</em>) on Shabbat. Doing so is akin to
        demolishing something (<em>Soter</em>) on Shabbat. Therefore, if oil is
        dripping from a lamp, one may not put a container underneath it to
        collect the oil. Since the lamp and its oil are <em>muktzeh</em>, the
        container will become forbidden to move, and thus it will no longer be
        fit for normal use on Shabbat. If one wants to ensure that the dripping
        oil does not make a mess, he should put something under it before
        Shabbat. Similarly, one may not put a container under a chicken in
which it can lay its eggs. Since an egg laid on Shabbat is        <em>muktzeh</em>, the container with an egg in it will become forbidden
        to move (<em>Shabbat</em> 42b; SA 310:6, 265:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there is a way around this problem. Before placing the
        receptacle beneath the lamp or the chicken, one may place an item that
        is more important than the oil or egg. One may then move the container
        for the sake of that non-<em>muktzeh </em>item (MB 265:6).
    </p>
    <p>
If one is worried about sparks flying from a lamp, he may put a        <em>kli</em> underneath it to collect the sparks. Because sparks are
        insubstantial and go out almost immediately, the <em>kli</em> may
        subsequently be moved. It is not rendered unsuitable for its normal
        use. However, he should not put water into the <em>kli</em>, because
        that will extinguish the sparks more quickly (<em>Shabbat</em> 47b; SA
        265:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        Making pillows and blankets wet is forbidden, because doing so makes
        them unsuitable for their normal use (SA 305:19). It is also forbidden
        to make an item of clothing so dirty that it is no longer wearable
        without washing. If liquid spilled on the floor, one may not use
        clothing to mop it up; by doing so, one is making the clothing unfit to
        wear. However, one may use a rag to mop up the spill, since this is the
        intended use of the rag. It is also permissible for many people to dry
        their hands on a towel, even if it will eventually become too wet to
        use any longer. This is because they are not making it unusable;
        rather, they are using it for its intended purpose. Similarly, one may
        put a garbage bag into a garbage can on Shabbat and put garbage in it,
        even though doing so gives the bag the <em>muktzeh</em> status of the
        garbage inside it. This is not considered rendering it unusable, as
        holding garbage is the purpose of the garbage bag (<em>Levush</em>
        265:3; <em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 308:17:7; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2,
        p. 480; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 2:19:329).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may place a box in front of chicks as a step stool so that they can
go back and forth from their coop. Even though animals are        <em>muktzeh</em>, this is not considered making the box unusable, since
        he can shoo the chicks away from it whenever he wants. However, while
        they are on the box, he may not move it (<em>Shabbat</em> 128b; SA
        308:39).

    <a name="12"></a><h2>
12. The Permissibility of Removing Filthy Items - "        <em>Graf Shel Re’i</em>"
    </h2>
    <p>
        Even though a truly disgusting item - such as a <em>graf shel re’i</em>
        (a receptacle that contains excrement), a dead mouse, or food scraps -
        is <em>muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em>, the Sages permitted removing it for
        the sake of human dignity. They did not encumber this removal by
requiring that it be done with a <em>shinui</em> or        <em>min ha-tzad</em>. Rather, one may remove it directly. This is all
        on condition that the item is in a place where it is disturbing people.
        However, if it is in a place where it is not bothering anyone, it may
        not be moved (<em>Beitza</em> 36b; <em>Shabbat</em> 121b; SA 308:34).
    </p>
    <p>
        The details of this law depend on how disgusting the item is and where
        it is located. Inside one’s home, even if an item is only slightly
        dirty - such as a pot with food remnants, a cup with a little wine left
        over, or an oil lamp covered in soot - as long as it causes discomfort,
        it is considered a <em>graf shel re’i</em> and may be removed. This is
        also the case in a yard if people are sitting nearby. However, if there
        are no people nearby, one may not remove it. If there is excrement in
        the street or in a yard where people walk, since it is truly repulsive,
        it may be removed even if no one is sitting nearby. However, if it is
        in a backyard that almost no one walks through, removing it is
        forbidden. If there is a dead animal giving off a horrible stench, then
        even if no one walks by it may be removed (MB 308:131; BHL 308:4 s.v.
        "keli"; Rema 279:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 5).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though shells and pits are <em>muktzeh</em>, one may clear them
        from the table with one’s hands and throw them in the garbage. This may
        even be done in two steps: first piling them on the side of the table,
        then collecting them to deposit in the trash (some say that this is the
        basis for permission to sweep on Shabbat; see n. 14 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who is cracking seeds with his mouth may remove each shell from his
        mouth by hand and either throw it away or pile it on a plate and then
        dispose of it later. However, he should not keep them in his hands in
        order to throw them out later (SSK 20:26). Similarly, one may empty out
        the refuse that accumulates in a sink strainer.
    </p>
    <p>
        A garbage can that has garbage in it is <em>muktzeh.</em> However, if
        it is unpleasant to have a full garbage can, it may be taken out (on
        condition that there is an <em>eruv</em>). If one lives somewhere that
        has a dumpster (as opposed to private garbage cans), the garbage pail
        may be emptied into the dumpster and then brought back inside (SSK
        22:48).

        13. Broken <em>Kelim</em> and Worn-Out Clothing
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen (section 3), any item that is not suitable for Shabbat
        use is <em>muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em>. We must now clarify at what point
        an item is considered unusable and therefore <em>muktzeh</em>. As a
        rule, there are two factors that affect the status of such an object:
        its objective state, and the owner’s subjective attitude toward it. We
        will now explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one threw out perfectly good clothes or <em>kelim</em> before
        Shabbat, they do not become <em>muktzeh</em> even though he is their
        owner. Since his personal attitude differs from that of most people, it
        is disregarded by <em>halakha</em>. Nevertheless, if before Shabbat he
threw out used clothing and <em>kelim</em>, they become        <em>muktzeh</em> even if some people would use such items. Since the
        owner threw them out, and they are used, they become <em>muktzeh</em>
        (SA 308:12; MB <em>ad loc. </em>51; Rema 308:7). But if he threw them
        out on Shabbat, they do not become <em>muktzeh</em>. Since they were
        not <em>muktzeh</em> when Shabbat began (as they were still somewhat
        fit for use), they do not lose their status over the course of Shabbat
        (MB 308:32).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a <em>kli</em> breaks on Shabbat and the broken parts are still
usable, the parts are not <em>muktzeh</em>. The broken pieces are only        <em>muktzeh</em> if there is no possibility of using them.
        Nevertheless, if there is a danger that people may be hurt by the
broken pieces, one may even use his hands to clear them away. If a        <em>kli</em> broke before Shabbat and the owner threw away the broken
pieces, then even if they could be used on Shabbat, they are        <em>muktzeh</em> (SA 308:6-7; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 48; SSK 20:42).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one part of a <em>kli</em> fell off (whether on Shabbat or before
        Shabbat) but it can be reattached, then even though it is not usable
over Shabbat, it is not <em>muktzeh</em>. Just as one may move the        <em>kli</em>, one may move the part that broke off, because it is still
        considered part of the <em>kli</em>. Therefore, if a beaded necklace
broke, since one intends to restring the beads, they are not        <em>muktzeh</em> (on condition that there is no concern that a knot
        will be tied on Shabbat to hold the necklace together). Similarly,
        false teeth or crowns that fall out are not <em>muktzeh</em>, since one
        intends to put them back. A button that falls off an item of clothing
        is not <em>muktzeh</em> either, since it will be replaced. Even though
        a new button is <em>muktzeh</em> since there is no use for it on
        Shabbat, in this case the button is not <em>muktzeh</em>, since it has
        already been part of the item of clothing.
        <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, if an item was attached to the ground and then broke on
        Shabbat, it is <em>muktzeh</em> because nobody plans to move something
        attached to the ground. Therefore, if a door in a house falls off on
Shabbat, one may not move it (<em>Shabbat</em> 122b; SA 308:8-10; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 35).

    <p>
        If disposable dishes have been used but could still be reused, they are
        not <em>muktzeh</em>. However, once they have been thrown into a filthy
        garbage can, they are <em>muktzeh</em>. Even if they have not been
        thrown away, they are <em>muktzeh</em> if they are so dirty that they
        would generally not be reused. However, if they are in a place where
        their filthiness disturbs people, they may be cleared away, as they are
        considered a <em>graf shel re’i</em> (as explained in section 12; SSK
        20:42).

    <p>
        If one dried his hands with paper towels and then put them into the
        paper recycling bin, they are still not <em>muktzeh</em> if people
        sometimes reuse them to wipe up spills. However, if the paper towels
        were deposited in a regular dirty garbage can, from which people
        generally would not retrieve them, they are <em>muktzeh</em>.

        14. The Permissibility of Moving <em>Muktzeh</em> Indirectly or with
        the Body
    </h2>
    <p>
The main prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em> consists of taking a        <em>muktzeh</em> item in one’s hand, the way it is normally moved. The
        more one deviates from the normal manner of taking an object, the more
        lenient the law becomes. There are two types of change (<em>shinui</em>
        ) that can be used: <em>min ha-tzad</em> (indirectly, literally "from
        the side") and <em>be-gufo</em> (using a part of the body besides the
        hand. One may move a <em>muktzeh</em> item indirectly, but only for a
        permitted activity. One may move a <em>muktzeh </em>item with his body
        even for the sake of the <em>muktzeh</em> item or a prohibited
        activity. We will now explain:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Min ha-tzad</em>
        is accomplished by hand, but indirectly. For example, one may pick up
        fruit covered in straw or dirt in a way that causes them to move. Since
        the <em>muktzeh</em> items are moved indirectly, through the permitted
        action of moving the fruit, and the purpose is a permitted activity -
        eating the fruit - there is no prohibition (<em>Shabbat</em> 123a; SA
        311:8-9). Similarly, if one wants to study Torah from a book that has a
        pen lying on it (assuming the pen was forgotten there, so the book is
        not a <em>basis</em>; see section 5 above), he may pick up the book
        even though the pen will then fall off. Likewise, if one accidentally
        left coins on a pillow and he now wants to sleep on it, he may lift up
        the pillow so that the coins will fall off. If one accidentally left a
        rock on top of a barrel and now wants wine from the barrel, he may tip
        the barrel and cause the rock to fall off. If the barrel was packed
        tightly among other barrels so that it cannot be tipped over, or if
        tipping it would break the barrel next to it, he may lift up the barrel
        while the rock is on top of it and move it to where he can slide the
        rock off without causing damage (<em>Shabbat</em> 142b; SA 309:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may pick up a broom and use it to sweep up dust or leaves, which
        are <em>muktzeh</em>. This is because one is doing it indirectly, not
        with his hands but with a broom, for a permitted purpose - so that the
        place will be clean. Similarly, if one wants to use a table, he may use
a knife to move away shells (that do not have the status of<em>graf she re’i</em>)<em> </em>that have been left on the table (        <em>Taz</em> 308:18; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 115).
        <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If one wants to move the <em>muktzeh</em> item for its own sake, to
        protect it, one may not move it even indirectly. For example, if money
        was left on a chair and one is concerned that the money will be stolen,
        he may not tip the chair so that the money will fall off and become
        hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, one may use part of his body to move the money and conceal
        it. For the entire prohibition of moving <em>muktzeh</em> on Shabbat is
        to do so in the normal manner, with one’s hand. The Sages did not
        prohibit moving <em>muktzeh</em> with the body. This includes moving
        with one’s foot, his arm, his breath, or any other limb other than the
        hand (SA 311:8; Rema 308:3). Therefore, if money is lying on the
        ground, one may move it with his foot to conceal it. Similarly, if an
        item is lying on the ground and is at risk of being stepped on and
        broken, he may use his foot to move it out of harm’s way. So, too, if a
        drawer has become a <em>basis</em> but has an item in it which one
        needs, he may open the drawer with part of his body and remove the
        necessary item. One may sit on a stone or on the wood of a construction
        site even though sitting down causes it to move (MB 308:82). Similarly,
        one may lean on a car, on condition that doing so will not set off the
        alarm.
    </p>
    <a name="15"></a><h2>
        15. If One Picked up <em>Muktzeh</em> Permissibly or Mistakenly, and
        the Status of a Minor
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, one may move a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> for a
permitted purpose (<em>le-tzorekh gufo</em>) or for its space (        <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em>). Thus, one may take a hammer to crack nuts.
        After use, one is not required to drop it. Rather, he may return the
        hammer to its proper place. If there were scissors on the table where
        one now wants to eat, he need not drop them as close to the table as
        possible, but may put them away. Since he picked them up in a permitted
        fashion, he may carry them to their proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if one finished eating fruit and is left holding peels or
        pits that are <em>muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em>, he does not need to drop
        them. Since they reached his hand permissibly, he may take them where
        he wants.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, once one has already put down a <em>muktzeh</em> item that
        he had been permitted to hold, it resumes its <em>muktzeh </em>status.
        At that point, even if it is not in its proper place, he may no longer
move it (SA 308:3; MB 506:29). Similarly, if one forgot that an item is        <em>muktzeh</em> and picked it up, he must put it down immediately (MB
        308:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one is carrying a <em>muktzeh</em> item that he had been permitted
        to hold, <em>le-khatĥila</em> he should not shift the object from one
        hand to the other. This is because some maintain that moving the item
        to his other hand is like putting it down, in which case he may no
longer move it. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if he did shift the        <em>muktzeh</em> item to his other hand, he may continue going to the
        place where he wants to put it down.

    </p>
    <p>
        If a child is younger than the age of <em>ĥinukh</em> (see ch. 24), one
may hold his hand and walk with him, even if he is holding something        <em>muktzeh</em> in his other hand. As long as the adult is not
carrying the child, the adult is not considered carrying the        <em>muktzeh</em> item. However, one may not pick up a child who is
        holding something <em>muktzeh</em>. Rather, the adult should first
        shake the <em>muktzeh</em> item out of the child’s hand, and then pick
        him up. This shaking is permitted, because it is <em>min ha-tzad</em>
        for a permitted purpose, i.e., to pick up the child. If the child is
        crying hysterically and will not calm down unless someone picks him up
        along with the <em>muktzeh</em> item he is holding, one may pick him
        up. As we will see (24:6), the Sages permitted transgressing rabbinic
        enactments for the sake of a sick child, and a child who is crying
        hysterically is liable to become weak like a sick person. However, if
        the object the child is holding is valuable, one may not pick him up,
        because we are concerned that if the object falls, the adult will end
        up picking it up and carrying it (<em>Shabbat</em> 141b; SA 309:1).

            AHS 308:4-5 suggests that the prohibitions of <em>muktzeh</em> date
            back to the time of our teacher Moshe. Additionally, the Gemara
            mentions that in the days of Kings David and Shlomo, the
prohibition of <em>muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em> was already in effect (            <em>Shabbat</em> 30b). During the time of Neĥemia, the Sages saw
            that Shabbat desecration was widespread, and they decreed that all
            implements (<em>kelim</em>) would be considered <em>muktzeh</em>.
            There were only three <em>kelim</em>, considered necessary for
            eating, exempted from the prohibition. When the situation improved
            and people were once again careful about Shabbat laws, the Sages
            once again permitted the movement of most <em>kelim</em>, though a
            small number remained banned (<em>Shabbat</em> 123b; SAH 308:17;
            sections 7-9 below). Rashi and <em>She’iltot</em> maintain that the
            prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em> is by Torah law, since Rabba’s
            statement that one must prepare before Shabbat what he needs for
            Shabbat is based on the verse: "But on the sixth day, they shall
            prepare what they have brought in" (Shemot 16:5). The implication
of the verse is that anything that has not been prepared is            <em>muktzeh</em> (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 47b; <em>Beitza</em> 2b).
            However, almost all Rishonim maintain that Rabba changed his mind
            and would agree that the prohibition of <em>muktzeh</em> is
            rabbinic. This is the opinion of <em>Tosafot</em>, Rambam, Ramban,
            and Rashba. One interpretation of Rashi is that only the most
            serious types of <em>muktzeh</em> are prohibited by Torah law,
while the rest are rabbinic (<em>Pnei Yehoshu’a</em>,            <em>Beitza</em> 2b). Alternatively, Ĥatam Sofer explains that Rashi
            means that <em>muktzeh</em> is prohibited by Torah law only in the
            case of food items, as we are commanded to prepare food for
            Shabbat; in contrast, all other <em>muktzeh</em> prohibitions are
            rabbinic (OĤ 79). In any case, as we wrote in 22:1 based on Ramban,
            all the laws connected to the spirit of Shabbat are rooted in the
            Torah, while the Sages established the details of their observance.
            This is also implied by Rambam. See <em>Harĥavot</em> there.

            SA 308:31-32 explains that raw meat is not <em>muktzeh</em> since
            some people eat meat that way. In contrast, raw fish that people
            generally do not eat is <em>muktzeh</em>. According to MA and
others, raw meat that is soft (such as chicken) is not<em>muktzeh</em>, but raw meat that is hard and inedible is            <em>muktzeh</em>. According to <em>Taz</em> (<em>ad loc</em>. 20),
            if fish is edible by dogs, then even if in practice we do not feed
            such fish to dogs, it is not <em>muktzeh</em>. See MB and BHL,
            which incline toward the position of SA. It would seem that
            nowadays, when there are people who feed dogs meat and fish that
            people would eat as well, under pressing circumstances one may rely
            on <em>Taz</em>. This is the opinion of <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol.
            2, p. 359 and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 19:108.

            If one intended to place the <em>muktzeh</em> item on a permitted
            item for only part of Shabbat, according to Rabbeinu Tam it does
            not become a <em>basis</em>, while according to Rashi it does. SA
            309:4 is inclined to be stringent, but in times of necessity one
            may be lenient (MB <em>ad loc.</em> 21). There is a similar
            disagreement about the law if the <em>muktzeh</em> item was placed
            atop an item in the middle of Shabbat (by the owner or with his
consent). According to <em>Tosafot</em>, as long as the            <em>muktzeh</em> item is there, the base is <em>muktzeh</em>;
according to <em>Or Zaru’a</em>, however, it is not            <em>muktzeh</em>. According to Rashba and Ran, if one’s intention
            is that the <em>muktzeh</em> remain there until Shabbat is over,
then as long as the <em>muktzeh</em> item is there, the base is            <em>muktzeh </em>as well. MB 266:26 follows those who are lenient.
            See BHL 310:7 s.v. "mateh."
        </p>
        <p>
            The base becomes a prohibited <em>basis</em> only when it serves
            the <em>muktzeh</em> upon it; but when the <em>muktzeh</em> item
            serves the base, it does not become prohibited. Therefore, if one
            places a rock on a barrel to weigh down its cover and prevent it
            from opening, or if he places pieces of <em>muktzeh</em> wool on a
pot to keep it warm, the barrel or pot does not become            <em>muktzeh</em> (SA 259:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 9).

            If one intended to leave money in his pocket but decided on Shabbat
            that he would like to wear the clothing, what is the status of the
            clothing? If the garment itself is one of the sides of the pocket,
            as is generally the case with a shirt pocket, then the garment
            becomes a <em>basis</em> and may not be moved. In contrast, if the
            pocket is part of a separate lining sewn onto the clothing, as is
the case with most pants pockets, the clothing does not become a            <em>basis</em>, because the pocket is secondary to the whole
            garment. Thus, the pants may be moved. However, when possible, one
            should first shake the <em>muktzeh</em> item out of the pocket,
            taking care not to put one’s hand in the pocket or touch it from
            outside in order to shake the <em>muktzeh</em> item out. This is
because the pocket itself is <em>muktzeh</em> (Rema 310:7; MB            <em>ad loc.</em> 29-30; see SSK ch. 20 n. 275). If a money pouch is
            tied to an item of clothing, since the pouch is not sewn on, it is
not secondary to the clothing, and thus the clothing becomes a            <em>basis</em>.

            Some are lenient even if the candlesticks are silver because, in
their opinion, candlesticks are merely            <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-isur</em> (R. Akiva Eger). One should
            not rely on this opinion, because silver candlesticks are very
expensive and therefore are <em>muktzeh maĥmat ĥesron kis</em> (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 44:13; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, p. 334;            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 279:1). Also see SSK 20:61 with n. 242.
        </p>
        <p>
There is a dispute about the status of the <em>basis </em>of a<em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>. Some maintain that the base of a<em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> assumes the same status as the<em>kli</em> itself. Therefore, one may move it <em>le</em>-<em>tzorekh</em> <em>gufo</em> or <em>le</em>-<em>tzorekh</em>            <em>mekomo </em>(<em>Tehila Le-David</em> 308:1). Others maintain
that since a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> is not completely<em>muktzeh</em>, it does not render the base supporting it a            <em>basis</em> at all (<em>Yeshu’ot Yaakov</em>; see SSK 20:50).
            Since <em>muktzeh</em> is a rabbinic law, the <em>halakha</em>
            follows the more lenient position.

            If a desk or table has a drawer that contains <em>muktzeh</em>
            items of significance, then if the drawer can be completely removed
            from the table, the desk becomes a <em>basis</em> for the drawer
            and may not be moved (similar to the case in the previous note of a
            money pouch tied to clothing). If the drawer cannot be removed from
            the desk, then it is secondary to it (as a pants pocket is
            secondary to the pants), and the <em>muktzeh</em> items in the
            drawer do not render the desk <em>muktzeh</em>. In any case, the
            drawer itself is <em>muktzeh</em> because it is a <em>basis</em>
            (MB 310:31).

            Even though one may not move a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> to
            prevent it from being damaged or stolen, one may use a halakhic
            loophole (<em>ha’arama</em>) to accomplish this goal indirectly. In
other words, one may pick up the <em>kli</em><em> </em>initially            <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em><em> </em>or <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em> and
            then put it down where it is protected from the elements and from

            activity prohibited on Shabbat, such as firewood, kerosene, bar
            soap, thick liquid soap, laundry detergent, and shoe polish - is
            considered <em>muktzeh maĥmat gufo</em>, and thus may not be moved
even <em>le-tzorekh gufo</em><em> </em>or            <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em> (MB 308:34; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
            19:7).

An incandescent filament that was on throughout            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> has the same status as a flame that was
lit throughout <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> - it is absolutely            <em>muktzeh</em>, as explained in SA 279:1. However, some maintain
            that an incandescent filament differs from a flame, because flames
            are not normally moved, whereas devices with incandescent filaments
            are normally moved. Therefore, according to them, the status of the
appliance is that of a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> (            <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 41:16; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 3:50).
            Nevertheless, according to most <em>poskim</em> an incandescent
            filament has the same status as a flame, and the entire appliance
            is considered secondary and a <em>basis</em> to the filament and
thus completely <em>muktzeh</em> (SSK 20:15*;            <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 3:43; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, pp.
            425-426; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 19:181-184). See <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            According to a <em>beraita </em>in <em>Shabbat</em> 123b, in the
            time of Neĥemia, when many failed to keep Shabbat, the Sages
            decreed that all <em>kelim</em> are considered <em>muktzeh</em>
            (except for three; see below). Once the people returned to
meticulous observance, the Sages again permitted moving            <em>kelim </em>in a three-step process. Rava explains that the
Sages permitted moving a <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em> only<em>le-tzorekh gufo </em>and <em>le-tzorekh mekomo</em>, but            <em>kelim she-melakhtam le-heter</em> could be moved even in order
            to prevent their being damaged. According to most Rishonim, this
            permission to move <em>kelim</em> used for permissible things is
            limited to situations where there is a reason to move them (such as
            "from the sun to the shade" to protect them), but one may not move
them unnecessarily. This is the opinion of Ran and            <em>Magid Mishneh</em> (which derives this position from Rambam),
            and Rashba is inclined to be stringent as well. <em>Tur</em> and SA
            308:4 rule accordingly. However, according to Ra’ah and Ritva, when
            the Sages permitted moving <em>kelim</em> from the sun to the
            shade, they also permitted moving them for no reason at all.
            Aĥaronim recommend being stringent here, following SA.
        </p>
        <p>
In contrast, all agree that food and books were never decreed            <em>muktzeh</em> at all and may be moved even for no reason. This
is also the case regarding clothing and jewelry (            <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em> §105, <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan</em> §7 as
            cited in SSK 20:83).
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a disagreement about <em>kelim</em> that are regularly
            used during meals. The first position is that of Rambam (MT
25:1-3), <em>Shlah</em>, <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 66:3, and            <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Miketz 1. According to them, as
            stated in the Mishna (<em>Shabbat</em> 123b), three <em>kelim</em>
            were not included in the decree of <em>muktzeh</em> because they
            were necessary for eating. These three are: a tool for cutting
            pressed-fig cakes, a spoon to remove scum from the surface of soup,
            and a small knife left on the table to cut bread and meat. However,
            other <em>kelim</em> used for eating may not be moved without a
reason. The second approach is that of <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 123b, s.v. "miktzo’a"), Rosh,<em>Shiltei Giborim</em>, <em>Tehila Le-David</em> 308:4,            <em>Ĥesed La-alafim</em>, and MB 308:23. According to them, the
            three <em>kelim</em> mentioned in the <em>mishna</em> are only
            examples of <em>kelim</em> used frequently at meals. In fact, all
            tableware - cutlery, cups, and plates - have the same status and
            are not <em>muktzeh</em> at all. R. Ovadia Yosef rules stringently,
            even forbidding a nervous person from fidgeting with such items in
            order to calm his nerves (<em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, pp.
            452-457). Some who are generally stringent about <em>kelim</em> are
            lenient in this last case. This is the implication of AHS 308:15.
            SSK 20:83 agrees: "It is permitted for one to move an item if he
            finds pleasure in occupying himself with it, even if there is no
            practical purpose." <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 19 n. 108 records a
            similar ruling in the name of <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>. mia man sis for
            it, and therefore, is absolutely muktza (SSK 20:15*; Minhat Yitzhak
            43: Yalkut

            Why are a cooking pot and a burning lamp treated differently? A pot
            does not become <em>muktzeh</em>, because one does not especially
            want the food to cook during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>. He would be
            happy if it had finished cooking beforehand. In contrast, a lamp
            remains <em>muktzeh</em> throughout Shabbat because one does want
            it to give off light during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>. Since he
puts the lamp out of his mind during that time, it stays            <em>muktzeh</em> all of Shabbat (SA 279:1). Interestingly, if one
            has in mind to use the leftover oil after the lamp burns out, then
            since it is clear that the candle will go out, the remaining oil is
            not <em>muktzeh</em> (SA 279:4). However, according to Rema, once
            the lamp became <em>muktzeh</em> during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>,
            it may not be moved all day, and one’s intentions are irrelevant.
        </p>
        <p>
MB 308:63 states that clothes that were wet during            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em> are <em>muktzeh</em> for all of Shabbat.
            Many explain that he is referring to a case where it is not certain
            that they will dry over the course of Shabbat. In contrast, if it
is clear that they will dry, MB would agree that they are not<em>muktzeh</em> (<em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> 1:10:2, n. 4;            <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 1:81). Alternatively, some explain that the
            clothes remain <em>muktzeh</em> because there is a concern that
            people will end up wringing out the clothes to dry them, which is
            prohibited on Shabbat (<em>Az Nidberu</em> 1:5). In any case, in
            practice if it is clear that the clothes will dry on Shabbat, they
            may be moved (<em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §37; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch.
            19 n. 563 in the name of <em>Ĥazon Ish</em>). See <em>Harĥavot</em>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
If pieces of fruit were still attached to their tree during            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, and then fell off during Shabbat, they
            are <em>muktzeh</em> for all of Shabbat because they were not fit
            for use during <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>. It is assumed that one
            puts them out of his mind; had he wanted to use them on Shabbat, he
would have picked them before Shabbat began (SA 322:3; MB            <em>ad loc.</em> 7). Additionally, the Sages made a special decree
            against eating fruits that fall off on Shabbat, to ensure that no
            one would end up picking them on Shabbat (<em>Beitza</em> 3a; MB
            325:22). Therefore, even if it is known before Shabbat that a
            non-Jew is planning to pick the fruit on Shabbat, in which case
            they are not <em>muktzeh</em>, they nevertheless may not be eaten
            because of this decree (SHT <em>ad loc.</em> 26).
        </p>
        <p>
In contrast, if a kosher animal was alive during            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, and was slaughtered on Shabbat to feed a
            dangerously sick person, a healthy person may eat from the fresh
meat. We do not say that it was <em>muktzeh</em> during            <em>bein ha-shmashot</em>, as we do with the fruit. The difference
            is that while anyone can pick fruit (and would have done so before
            Shabbat if they were interested), not everyone knows how to
            slaughter. Thus, even though the owner did not slaughter the
animal, that does not mean he put it out of his mind (SA 318:2; MB            <em>ad loc.</em> 8).

            One may not turn something into a <em>graf shel re’i</em> in order
to make it permissible to move. If he did so, however,            <em>be-di’avad</em> it may be moved. For a great need or to prevent
            loss, one may to turn something into a <em>graf shel re’i</em> in
            order to be permitted to move it (SA 308:36-37). Therefore, if a
            roof is leaking dirty water (which is <em>muktzeh</em> as it is
            unusable even for washing), or if an air conditioner is dripping
            clean water (which is <em>muktzeh</em> as it is <em>nolad</em>, a
            new creation), one may not set out a bucket to collect the water.
            Doing so would make the bucket unusable, since one may not move an
            item that contains a <em>muktzeh</em> item within it. While it is
true that one may remove the dirty water because it is a            <em>graf shel re’i</em>, as we said, <em>le-khatĥila</em> we do not
            turn something into a <em>graf shel re’i </em>to make an item
            disgusting for this purpose (Rambam; SA 338:8; MA <em>ad loc.</em>
            12). Nevertheless, in a case of great need, in order to prevent
            dirtiness or damage, one may rely on those who permit placing a
            bucket to collect the water. Since the water is leaking in any
case, and since one may dump the water out of the bucket because of            <em>graf shel re’i</em>, the bucket has not become unusable.
            Therefore, one may pour the water out of the bucket before it fills
up, in order to avoid dirtying the floor (<em>Tur</em> §338,<em>Taz</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 4; <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>; BHL            <em>ad loc</em>., s.v. "asur").

This is the approach of <em>Minĥat Shabbat</em> 88:2;<em>Az Nidberu</em> 7:46; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:12:40; and            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 19:167. SSK 15:72 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
            vol. 2, p. 394, agree, but conclude that it is good to be stringent
            and avoid carrying a button that fell off because there are
            Rishonim (Me’iri, R. Yonatan of Lunel) who maintain that the only
            reason that one may move the detached door of a <em>kli</em> is
            that it can still be used (to cover something), not that it retains
            its status of part of the <em>kli</em>. If so, a button that cannot
            be used at all on Shabbat is <em>muktzeh</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should add that if there is a concern that one might end up
            taking the part of the <em>kli</em> that fell off on Shabbat and
reattaching it in a permanent way, thus transgressing            <em>Boneh</em>, the Sages forbade moving the broken part. For
            example, if the leg of a bench fell off, one may not move the
            broken bench on Shabbat in order to rest it on a different bench,
            because he may end up fixing it. However, if it would be difficult
            to fix the <em>kli</em>, or if it has already been used in its
            broken state before Shabbat, we are not concerned that anyone will
            forget and fix it on Shabbat, so one may move it, as explained in
            SA 313:8 and Rema 308:16; above, 15:6.

            Other similar examples include a door handle, a faucet handle, or a
            toilet seat that fell off. In each of these cases, the item may
            only be used on Shabbat if two conditions are fulfilled: first, it
            must be possible to replace the broken part in a clearly temporary
            way, so that it can still be used for its designated purpose; and
            second, there must be no reason to be concerned that one will
            reattach it properly on Shabbat. Some further details about a door
handle are explained in 15:3 above. See also <em>Ĥut S</em>            <em>hani</em>, 2:36:4:7, 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example is if the door of a cabinet or closet fell off. If
            the cabinet is small (its volume is less than forty <em>se’ah</em>,
            which is an <em>ama</em> by an <em>ama</em> by three <em>amot</em>
), then if the door will eventually be reattached, it is not            <em>muktzeh</em> (Rema 314:1; SSK 20:45 and n. 164). However, if
            the cabinet or closet is larger than forty <em>se’ah</em>, its door
is considered the same as the door of a house, and it is            <em>muktzeh</em>. <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 19 n. 236 suggests
            that if a piece of furniture is larger than forty <em>se’ah</em>
            but is occasionally moved (like the <em>bima</em> on which the
            Torah scroll is read), when it comes to <em>muktzeh</em> it is
            considered a <em>kli</em> (rather than a house).

            It is true that some are stringent, maintaining that since a broom
            is taken in order to move <em>muktzeh </em>objects, moving with a
broom is considered direct, not <em>min ha-tzad</em> (SAH 308:60;            <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> §67 and <em>Nishmat Adam</em> <em>ad loc.</em>
            6; <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 47:14). Nevertheless, since <em>muktzeh</em>
            is a rabbinic law, the lenient ruling is primary. This is the
            approach of SSK 22:37-38 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, pp.
            326-327. Besides, there are additional reasons to justify leniency
            in the case of sweeping - e.g., because what is being swept is
            considered a <em>graf shel re’i</em> or because it is
            insignificant. See <em>Harĥavot</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
The Aĥaronim disagree whether one may indirectly move something            <em>muktzeh</em> in order to use the <em>muktzeh </em>object itself
            for a permitted activity. For example, may one move a tray with a
            burning lamp on it in order to benefit from the lamplight (assuming
            that the tray also has a non-<em>muktzeh</em> item on it that is
more important than the lamp, and thus the tray is not a            <em>basis</em>, as we explained in section 6)? <em>Beit Meir</em>
            276:3 and <em>Pri Megadim</em> (<em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 308:18)
            are lenient; it is indirect movement for a permitted activity.
            However, SAH 376:10 is stringent; since the primary purpose of
            moving the tray is to use the lamp, the activity is not permitted,
            as it constitutes moving <em>min ha-tzad </em>for the purpose of
            something forbidden. SSK ch. 20 n. 194 states that one who wishes
            to be lenient has an opinion on which to rely.
        </p>
        <p>
            One may move part of a <em>muktzeh</em> item for a permitted
            activity. For example, one may adjust the vents of an air
conditioner or the dials on a wall clock, even though the clock is<em>muktzeh maĥmat ĥesron kis</em>, according to SSK 28:26, n. 55.            <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 19 n. 466, disagrees and prohibits doing
            so.

Those who prohibit continuing to carry after shifting a<em>muktzeh</em> object from one hand to the other include<em>Tosefet Shabbat</em>, introduction to §308;            <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Miketz 3; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>
            308:27; <em>Az Nidberu</em> 9:33; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 1:13:2.
Those who permit include <em>Pri Megadim</em>,            <em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 446:2; <em>Torat Shabbat</em> 308:4; SSK
            ch. 20 n. 27 is inclined this way as well.

According to MA 308:7, if one mistakenly picked up a            <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur</em>, he may put it down wherever he
wants. According to most <em>poskim</em>, though, the status of a            <em>kli she-melakhto le-isur </em>is the same as that of other
            types of <em>muktzeh</em> - he should put it down immediately,
            wherever he is (<em>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</em> 266:12; MB <em>ad loc.</em>
            13; SSK 22:34).

            Some say that one may not even hold the hand of a child and walk
            with him if the child is carrying an expensive <em>muktzeh</em>
            item in his other hand. Others maintain that as long as one does
            not carry the child, it is permitted (Ramban). Under pressing
            circumstances, one may be lenient (BHL 309:1).
