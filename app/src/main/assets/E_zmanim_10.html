    Chapter Ten: The Laws of Tish’a B’Av
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>10.1 – Instituting the Fast of Tish’a B’Av</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    As we already learned (6.1), the prophets instituted four fasts after the destruction of the First Temple, the gravest of which is <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>,
for that is when the Temple was destroyed (for more on the meaning of the fast, see above, 6.4). These fast were instituted along the lines of    <em>Yom Kippur</em>, which lasts an entire day and contains five prohibitions. When the Second Temple was built, these fasts were annulled, and they became
    joyous holidays. And when that Temple was destroyed, the four fasts returned to their original status.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    After the period of harsh decrees ended and a new era began, in which the Temple was still in ruins but evil decrees no longer plagued us, the Sages
    determined that the law of three of the fasts – the tenth of Tevet, the seventeenth of Tammuz, and Tzom Gedalyah – depended on Israel’s will: “If they want
    to fast, they do so; if they do not want [to fast], they do not fast.”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    On <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, however, we are obligated to fast under all circumstances, because many tragedies befell the Jewish people on that day, including
    the destruction of both Temples. Even when times are tranquil, its status is not dependent on Israel’s will. Rather, as long as the Temple sits in ruins,
    we must fast on that day, as the prophets enacted (<em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 18b).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This is the fundamental difference between <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> and the minor fasts. Our obligation to fast on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is based on an
    institution of the prophets; therefore all the laws of the fast apply in their entirety. On the minor fasts, however, our obligation is based on custom –
    because [all of] Israel agreed to fast [on these days], until the Temple is rebuilt – and from the very outset, the accepted custom was to treat them more
    leniently than <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> (as we explained above, 7.1).
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>10.2 – General Rules of the Fasts </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are three halachic differences between <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> and the minor fasts: <strong>1)</strong> <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> lasts an entire day, from
    sunset until the emergence of the stars [the next day], while the minor fasts last only during daylight hours – from daybreak until the emergence of the
    stars. <strong>2)</strong> On <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, we are forbidden to do five things: a) eat and drink, b) wash ourselves, c) anoint our bodies, d) wear
    [leather] shoes, and e) engage in marital relations. On the minor fasts, however, we are only forbidden to eat and drink. <strong>3)</strong> Only sick
    people are exempt from fasting on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, whereas pregnant and nursing women, as well, are exempt from the other fasts.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In general, the fast of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is equal to that of <em>Yom Kippur</em>, for any enactment the Rabbis made regarding <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> was
    modeled after the Torah’s commandments regarding <em>Yom Kippur</em>. Therefore, <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> has the same five prohibitions that are mentioned in
reference to <em>Yom Kippur</em>. Nonetheless, since the fast of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is a Rabbinic enactment, its laws are more lenient in two major ways:    <strong>1)</strong> The Rabbis did not require the sick to fast on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. In contrast, someone who is ill on Yom Kippur must fast, unless
    doing so would put his life in danger. <strong>2)</strong> In situations of doubt, one should act strictly on <em>Yom Kippur</em>, but one may be lenient
    when it comes to <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. For the rule is, when in doubt regarding a Torah law, one should be strict, but when in doubt regarding a Rabbinic
    law, the <em>halachah</em> follows the more lenient opinion.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is more stringent than <em>Yom Kippur</em> in a certain way. On <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, we are obligated to mourn. Therefore,
    we sit on the floor, refrain from greeting one another, darken the room at night, and limit our Torah study to sad topics. On <em>Yom Kippur</em>, in
    contradistinction, we are obligated only to deprive ourselves, but besides the five afflictions, the day is considered a holiday: We wear nice clothing,
    sit on [regular] seats, sing songs, exchange greetings with one another, and of course, engage in Torah study with no limits. (Unrelated to
    self-affliction, one is forbidden to do work on <em>Yom Kippur</em>, in accordance with all the laws of <em>Shabbat</em>.)
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>10.3 – Eating and Drinking and the Laws of Sick People and Postpartum Women</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We already expounded upon the prohibition against eating and drinking vis-à-vis the minor fasts (above, 7.5-7), and we learned that there is a difference
    between them and <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>: the minor fasts begin at daybreak, while <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> begins at sunset. There is no difference, however,
    regarding the fundamental prohibition against eating and drinking.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We also learned that the sick are exempt from fasting on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> (the definition of “sick” is explained above, 7.7); and they need not eat
    less than the minimum measure. Only on <em>Yom Kippur</em>, which is biblically ordained and which even the sick are obligated to keep, must one eat less
    than the minimum measure, when possible, to avoid breaking the fast. On Rabbinically instituted fasts, however, the sick are completely exempt; therefore,
    they need not eat less than the minimum measure or fast for a few hours. Nevertheless, several <em>Acharonim</em> write that, if possible, it is
    appropriate for sick people to act stringently and refrain from eating and drinking on the night of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, in order to join in the
    community’s pain. In the morning, though, they are allowed to eat and drink according to their needs, with no limitations.

<p dir="LTR">
    A woman within thirty days of childbirth is considered ill, because she has not yet sufficiently regained her strength. Therefore, she is exempt from
    fasting (<em>Sh.A</em>. 551:6).
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A woman who has a miscarriage and feels weak has the same status as a woman after childbirth and is exempt from the fast of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, if it
    occurs thirty days after her miscarriage.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Those who are exempt from fasting should be careful to eat only simple foods that are needed for their health, not delicacies and treats for the sake of
    self-gratification. The <em>poskim</em> debate whether or not one [who is permitted to eat] says <em>Nachem</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>10.4 – Pregnant and Nursing Women</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We have learned that one of the differences between the minor fasts and <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is that pregnant and nursing women are exempt from the former
    and obligated in the latter (above 7.8). The reason for this is that only the sick are exempt from fasting on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, and pregnant and
    nursing women – despite their various aches and pains – are not considered sick (<em>Sh.A.</em> 554:5). If, however, they experience extraordinary
    weakness, their status is like that of a sick person, and they are exempt from fasting on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    For example, a pregnant woman who suffers from excessive vomiting or dizziness is considered ill and need not fast. Similarly, a pregnant woman who is
    extremely weak – due to a low blood count, for example (less than 10 grams hemoglobin) – is exempt from fasting. It goes without saying that one should not
    fast if doing so could possibly cause a miscarriage. A woman who is unsure whether or not she is considered ill should begin the fast. Then, if she starts
    feeling very weak, her status changes from that of a regular pregnant woman to that of a sick person, allowing her to eat and drink.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    As we learned, a nursing woman is obligated to fast on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. And even though it is harder for her to fast, because nursing depletes one’s
    liquids, that does not put her in the category of a sick person. The baby doesn’t suffer from the fast either, for if its mother is one of those whose milk
    does not decrease when she fasts, the baby will certainly not feel any difference. And even if the mother’s milk supply decreases when she fasts, she can
    supplement her baby’s diet with sweetened water or hot cereal, such that the baby will not suffer as a result of the fast.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    The best advice for most women whose milk decreases is to skip two feedings in alternating fashion. That is, a woman who nurses every three hours should
    feed her baby at 10:00 a.m., give him a bottle at 1:00 p.m., nurse again at 4:00 p.m., and give him another bottle at 7:00 p.m. This way, she will not
    suffer too much from fasting and her milk will not diminish. A nursing woman may eat and drink if she feels so weak that her status changes from a [mere]
    nursing woman to a sick person.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>10.5 – Washing</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Any form of washing for the sake of pleasure is forbidden on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, whether the water is hot or cold. One may not even wash a small part of
    his body; it is even forbidden to dip one finger in water. But someone who got mud, feces, or blood on himself may wash the soiled area, because his
    intention is not to pamper himself (<em>Sh.A. O.C.</em> 554:9). Similarly, a woman who needs to change her child’s diaper may wash the soiled area, even
    though her hand will get washed in the process. She may even use soap if the filth or odor does not come off with water alone.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A woman who is preparing food with which to break the fast, or for her children, may rinse food items or dishes, because she is not washing for the sake of
    pleasure. And even though some pleasure is derived every time one washes a soiled area of the body, it is not considered washing for the sake of pleasure,
    since her main intent is to remove the filth.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Someone who perspired excessively, to the point where he is very bothered and distressed, may wash the sweaty area, because his intention is not to get
    pleasure (<em>M.B.</em> 613:2, <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In addition, someone who is very sensitive and cannot orientate himself in the morning until he washes his face may do so with [plain] water. One who is
    always accustomed to using water to remove the crusty discharge that builds up in the eyes overnight may do so [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>] (<em>Sh.A.</em>
    554:11, <em>M.B.</em> 22).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is forbidden to rinse one’s mouth on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. Nevertheless, one who will be very distressed if he does not do so, may rinse out his mouth
    and brush his teeth, without toothpaste, on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. On <em>Yom Kippur</em>, however, when the obligation to fast is biblical, one should not
    be lenient on this issue (see above, 7.5, note 6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A bride within the first thirty days of her marriage may wash her face and apply any lotion she needs, to avoid making herself unattractive to her husband
    (<em>M.B.</em> 554:29, <em>Sha’ar HaTz</em>iyun 38).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may take a slightly damp towel and run it across one’s face, hands, and feet, because the prohibition of washing does not apply to such a small amount
    of moisture. The only condition is that the towel not be <em>tofei’ach al menat le’hatpi’ach</em>, meaning, it cannot be so wet that it could moisten one’s
    hand to the extent that his hand could then moisten something else (<em>Rama</em> 554:14, <em>M.B.</em> 27).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>10.6 – Mitzvah-Related Washing</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is permissible to wash one’s hands for the sake of a <em>mitzvah</em>, because it is not for pleasure purposes. Therefore, <em>kohanim</em> (“priests”)
    may wash their hands fully, in preparation for the priestly blessings (<em>Rama</em> 613:3, <em>Sh.A.</em> 128:6). However, one is not permitted to immerse
    in a <em>mikveh</em> on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Upon awakening in the morning, everyone is obligated to wash his or her hands up until the joints connecting the fingers to the palm of the hand, because
    an evil spirit rests on one’s hands after a night’s sleep, and it can cause harm to the orifices of the body. In order to remove this spirit, one must wash
    each hand three times, alternately. After using the bathroom, one should wash his hands again, once, and recite the blessing <em>Al netillat yadayim</em>,
    because the Sages instituted a <em>mitzvah</em> to wash one’s hands, with a blessing, in preparation for the morning prayers (<em>Shacharit</em>). And even
    though we are usually careful to wash the entire hand, on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> one should wash only up to the joints connecting the fingers to the palm,
because according to the letter of the law, that is sufficient both in terms of preparing for <em>Shacharit</em> and in order to remove the evil spirit (    <em>Sh.A.</em> 613:2).
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Throughout the year, one should preferably wash his hands three times before every prayer service. Nevertheless, on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, one should not
    wash his hands before praying, because doing so is not obligatory. However, one who touched filthy parts of his body and wants to recite holy words should
    wash his hands, because he is doing so for the sake of a <em>mitzvah</em>, not in order to derive pleasure (<em>M.B.</em> 613:5-6, <em>K.H.C.</em> 6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is uncertainty regarding the law of someone who relieves himself without touching any part of the body that is usually covered, for perhaps he does
    not need to wash, seeing that he did not touch any filth. In order to avoid the quandary, it is best to touch a usually-covered part of the body – which
    have flecks of sweat – when using the bathroom. This way, everyone would agree that one may wash his hands until the upper knuckles, in order to say the
    blessing of <em>Asher Yatzar</em> in cleanliness (<em>Sh.A.</em> 613:3, <em>M.B.</em> 4).
    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>10.7 – Anointing, Smelling Spices, and Smoking</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is forbidden to apply oil or cream [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>] even to a small area of the body. One is also forbidden to use cosmetics, like powders or
    salves, to beautify the skin or provide a nice fragrance. This prohibition applies specifically to anointing for the sake of pleasure; applying creams for
    medicinal purposes, however, is permitted. Therefore, one may apply Vaseline to dry lips or put on an anti-itch cream (<em>Sh.A.</em> 554:15). One may,
    similarly, put on mosquito repellant.
    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may not smell spices on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because doing so is pleasurable and one should curtail one’s pursuit of pleasures on the day on which our
    Holy Temple was destroyed. Granted, there are [halachic authorities] who rule leniently [on this issue] because [smelling fragrances] is not one of the
five prohibitions (<em>M.A.</em>); nonetheless, most <em>poskim</em> hold that one should act strictly on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em> 559:7,    <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 556:1). See the footnote regarding smoking.
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>10.8 – Wearing Shoes </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    On <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, it is forbidden to wear sandals or shoes made from leather. According to many authorities, only leather shoes are forbidden, while
    those made from other materials, like rubber and plastic, are permissible, even if they are as good as leather shoes (Rif, Rosh).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Others hold that the prohibition applies to any comfortable shoe that keeps its wearer from feeling the roughness of the road (Razah). At the time of    <em>Chazal</em>, only leather shoes were considered good. No one made good shoes from other materials; consequently, the prohibition did not apply to such
    shoes. Today, however, when [manufacturers] make shoes and sandals from other materials, and they are as good as their leather counterparts, one is
forbidden to wear them on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. According to this opinion, one may not wear sneakers, “Source” (<em>Shoresh</em>) sandals, or the like on    <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, but one may walk around in slippers or canvas shoes with a thin sole, for one can feel the roughness of the road in them.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, the accepted ruling is that non-leather footwear is permissible. Nonetheless, one who can, without difficulty, make do with slippers or canvas
    shoes that do not fully protect the feet should act stringently (<em>M.B.</em> 614:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even according to the lenient opinion, one should not walk around in shoes or sandals made from synthetic leather, which look like [the real thing],
    because of <em>mar’it ayin</em> (doing something that appears to be forbidden).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A sick person or a postpartum woman, who are liable to catch a cold if they walk barefoot, may wear leather shoes. Similarly, one who [needs to] walk in a
    place where there is a possible danger of scorpions, or the like, may wear leather shoes. So too, one who [needs to] walk in a muddy place may wear regular
    shoes in order to avoid soiling his feet. A soldier on active duty may wear army boots (<em>Sh.A.</em> 554:17, 614:3-4). [The reason for all these
    leniencies is] because wearing shoes or sandals is prohibited [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>] only if one wears them for the sake of walking or comfort, but when
    there is another reason for wearing them, the prohibition does not apply. However, even when it is halachically permissible to wear shoes, one should not
    wear leather shoes if he can suffice with non-leather ones. After all, one may be lenient only when there is a need, and there is no need to wear leather
    shoes when one has shoes made from some other material.

</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>10.9 – Marital Relations</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The fifth way in which we afflict ourselves [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>] is by refraining from marital relations. In order to avoid stumbling in this matter,
    a couple must act on the night of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> as they do when the wife is a <em>niddah</em> (a menstrual woman). That is, they may not touch each
    other, sleep in the same bed, or pass things to each other from hand to hand, [etc.]. During the day, however, they need not observe all the precautionary
    measures that are in place when a woman is a <em>niddah</em>, but affectionate touching and sleeping in the same bed are still forbidden.
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>10.10 – Torah Study</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
In addition to the five [pleasures] that are forbidden on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, there are [other] prohibitions that are connected to the fact that    <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is a day of mourning. Just as a mourner is forbidden to learn Torah during the seven-day mourning period (<em>shivah</em>), one may
    not learn Torah on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, in order not to divert one’s attention from the mourning. Another reason one may not learn Torah during a period
    of mourning is that Torah study makes one happy, as it says, <em>The commandments of the Lord are upright, rejoicing the heart</em> (<em>Tehillim</em>
    19:9). It is even forbidden to learn Torah in thought, because even that makes one happy. However, it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to learn sad sections of the
    Torah, those that deal with Israel’s suffering and the afflictions that man encounters, for these areas are appropriate for the mood of the day. One should
    not learn them in depth, though, because such study makes one happy. But if one thinks of a novel idea (a <em>chiddush</em>) while studying a matter
    superficially, he need not worry, because that is the nature of learning (<em>A.H.Sh</em>. 554:4). And if he comes up with a significant <em>chiddush</em>
    and is worried that he may forget it by the end of the fast, he may write it down concisely (see <em>K.H.C.</em> 554:110).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One is allowed to learn the following topics: In <em>Tanach</em>, one may study the chapters that describe the <em>churban</em> (destruction), which are
    found in the books of <em>Melachim</em>, <em>Divrei HaYamim</em>, and <em>Megillat Eichah</em>. One may also learn the prophecies of the <em>churban</em>,
    which cover most of the book of <em>Yirmiyah</em>, part of <em>Yechezkel</em>, and small portions of <em>Yeshayah</em> and <em>T’rei Asar</em>. However,
    one should not study the prophecies that predict the destruction of the evil heathens, because they are joyous prophecies from our perspective. It is
    permissible to study the book of <em>Iyov</em>, which deals with suffering, but one should not study the end of the book [which is joyous]. One may also
    study the sections of admonition and calamity in the Torah portions of <em>BeChukotai</em>, <em>Ki Tavo</em>, and <em>Ha’azinu</em>. [In all of these
    cases], one may learn the verses with commentary, in order to understand the simple meaning of the passage, but not in order to delve deeply into it.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Regarding the aggadic sections of the writings of <em>Chazal</em>: one may study the passages dealing with the <em>churban</em> in Tractate <em>Gittin</em>
    (55b-58a) and [most of] <em>Midrash Eichah Rabbah</em>, skipping the sections that deal with consolation. It is also permissible to study the third chapter
    of Tractate <em>Mo’ed Kattan</em>, which deals with the laws of mourning and excommunication, as well as the Gemara at the end of Tractate <em>Ta’anit</em>
    , which discusses the laws of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In terms of halachic topics: one may study the laws of the three weeks and <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 550-561), as well as the
    laws of mourning (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 334-403). If a rabbi receives an urgent question in an area of <em>halachah</em> that one is forbidden to
    study on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, he should answer it without explaining his reasoning (<em>M.B.</em> 554:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may study <em>mussar</em> works [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], even though they quote [biblical] verses and rabbinic statements, because their whole
    purpose is to awaken a person to repent for his sins. Therefore, the regular joy one feels when learning Torah does not exist here.
    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Ideally, one should be careful about these laws starting midday of the eve of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. But we already learned that one who feels that limiting
his learning to these specific topics will curtail his learning should learn whatever his heart desires, until <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> begins (see    <em>Rama</em> 553:2; <em>M.B.</em> 8; above 9.3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
One may not read exciting books or newspapers, or study other disciplines on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, so as not to divert one’s attention from mourning (    <em>A.H.Sh.</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 384:9). It is, however, permissible, and even fitting, to read history books about the <em>churban</em>, the exile, and the
    hardships that have befallen the Jewish people.
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>10.11 – Greeting One Another</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Mourners are forbidden to greet people (lit., “seek the peace of others”) (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 385). Likewise, one may not extend greetings to
    others on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 5554:20). [After all], just as a person who has lost a close relative is not in a state of
    “peace,” no one is in a state of “peace” on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because we are mourning the destruction of our Holy Temple.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In particular, Torah students who know the <em>halachah</em> must be careful in this regard. However, when a person unfamiliar with the <em>halachah</em>
    extends greetings to another, the recipient should return the greeting in a soft voice and serious tone, as one who is preoccupied with thoughts of
    mourning and sorrow, making sure not to insult the person in the slightest. It is preferable to answer, “Good morning,” and avoid saying, “<em>Shalom</em>”
    (“Peace [unto you]”). If the person who initiated the greeting is someone who wants to learn Torah, and there is no concern that he will be insulted, one
    should explain to him that we do not greet each other on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to most <em>poskim</em>, one is even forbidden to say, “Good morning” or “Good evening (<em>M.B.</em> 554:41, <em>K.H.C.</em> 90). Some say that
    only the word “<em>Shalom</em>” is forbidden, while phrases like “Good morning” are permissible (<em>Leket Yosher</em>). We already mentioned that when
    necessary – in order not to insult someone – a person may return a greeting; and since some hold that “Good morning” and “Good evening” are not included in
    the prohibition, it is preferable to use these phrases than to say, “<em>Shalom</em>.”
    <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who meets a friend who just got married or had a child may wish him a “<em>Mazal Tov</em>,” for giving someone a blessing is not included in the
prohibition of extending a greeting (<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 554:19). Similarly, hand shaking is not included in the prohibition (<em>Har Tzvi</em>,    <em>Y.D.</em> 290).

    Just as one may not offer greetings on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, one may not send gifts either (<em>M.B.</em> 554:41). Charity, however, is not considered a
    gift. Therefore, one is permitted, even obligated, to send food to the needy, so they can have something to eat after the fast (see <em>K.H.C.</em>
    554:91).

<a name="12"></a><h2>10.12 – Trips and Visiting the Western Wall (Kotel) </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must avoid taking trips on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because they divert one’s attention from mourning. One should also avoid friendly conversations,
    because they can lead to laughter and lightheadedness (<em>Sh.A.</em> 554:21). It is a good practice to talk about the <em>churban</em>, Israel’s
    tribulations, and the ways of repentance for both the community and the individual.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even those who are accustomed to visiting cemeteries after the recitation of <em>Kinot</em> must be careful not to go in large groups, because they might
    become distracted from mourning (<em>Rama</em> 559:10, <em>M.B.</em> 41).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is obvious that one should not refrain from going to the <em>Kotel</em> out of concern that he might meet friends there and be happy. I heard from my
    father, my teacher, that there is no greater rectification for <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> than going to the Western Wall – the only remnant [of our Temple] left
    standing after the <em>churban</em> – and praying for the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> to be rebuilt speedily in our days. On the contrary, the fact that many
    people assemble there increases the power of the prayers and magnifies God’s glory. My father added that just as one would not say that it is forbidden to
build the Holy Temple during the Nine Days because it is an act of building that entails joy, so too one should not say that it is forbidden to visit the<em>Kotel</em> on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> for fear that one might meet friends there. Rather, if one meets his friends there, he should avoid saying    <em>Shalom</em>, but he may shake their hands lovingly and pray with them for the rebuilding of the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em>.

<a name="13"></a><h2>10.13 – Sitting and Lying on the Ground </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
According to [the letter of] the law, there is no obligation to sleep or lie on the ground on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. For <em>Chazal</em>’s statement – “All    <em>mitzvot</em> that apply to a mourner apply on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>” (<em>Ta’anit</em> 30a) – refers only to those acts that are <em>forbidden</em>
during the [seven-day] mourning period, like washing, anointing, wearing shoes, marital relations, greeting one another, and Torah study. However, the    <em>mitzvot</em> that a mourner must keep, like turning over the beds and sitting on the floor, do not apply on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> according to [the
    letter of] the law (<em>Tur</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 555). Nonetheless, the custom is to exhibit our mourning on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> in the way we lie and sit,
    as well. But since this law is based on custom, it is more lenient [than the other prohibitions are], as we will explain presently.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Lying down: Some people sleep on the ground; others sleep without a pillow; and still others place a stone beneath their heads (<em>Sh.A.</em> 555:2). One
    who finds it difficult to sleep in this manner, may sleep normally (<em>M.B.</em> 555:6). The prevalent custom is to… place one’s mattress on the ground,
    thus precluding the need to remove one’s pillow. It is best to place a stone underneath the mattress. This way, one observes the custom of mourning without
    having much difficulty falling asleep.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sitting: The custom is to sit on the ground like mourners. However, since there is no halachic obligation to do so, we are not strict about this all day
long (<em>Bach</em> 559:1). Ashkenazim [sit on the ground] until midday, while Sefardim [do so] until the <em>Minchah</em> (Afternoon) service    <em>(Sh.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em> 559:3). Thus, one who takes a nap in the afternoon need not place his mattress on the ground.
    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We already learned (above, 9.3) that some have a custom, based on <em>Kabbalah</em>, not to sit on the ground without a piece of cloth or wood to separate
    [between the person and the floor] (<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 555:8). If the floor is tiled, however, many [<em>poskim</em>] maintain that there is no need
    [for a separation], even according to <em>Kabbalah</em>. Some are meticulous to make a separation even on tiled floors, but many people follow the lenient
    custom.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Since there is no halachic obligation to sit on the ground, one may sit on a small cushion or a low bench, but they should preferably be no higher than a<em>tefach</em> (handbreadth) off the ground. If it is difficult to sit so low, one may be lenient and sit on a chair that is less than three    <em>tefachim</em> (24 cm) high. And if even this is difficult, one may sit on a chair that is slightly higher than three <em>tefachim</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sitting on stairs is considered sitting on the ground, because people step on them (<em>Mekor Chayim</em> by the [author of] <em>Chavot Ya’ir</em>). Some
    [authorities] allow one to sit on an overturned <em>stender</em> (lectern), even if it is higher than three <em>tefach</em>im. Since it is not designated
    for sitting, one who sits on it is not considered as one who sits on a chair. Pregnant women, the elderly, the sick, and those who suffer from back aches –
    for whom sitting on a low chair is difficult – may sit on regular chairs (<em>A.H.Sh.</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 387:3).
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>10.14 – Doing Work</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages state, “Anyone who works on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> will never see a sign of blessing” from it (<em>Ta’anit</em> 30b). The reason is that [doing
    work] distracts one from mourning. However, <em>Chazal</em> did not prohibit work on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> explicitly. Rather, some places had a custom to
    forbid it, while others had a custom to permit it. Thus, the Rabbis said that the local custom obligates [each individual]. Therefore, one is forbidden to
    work on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> in a place where the custom is to refrain from doing work (<em>Pesachim</em> 54b). Nowadays, all of Israel has a custom to
    refrain from doing work on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> until midday. It is proper to continue doing so after midday, as well, in order to remain focused on the
    mourning. Therefore, we work after midday only if it is very necessary (see <em>Sh.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em> 554:22, 24; <em>M.B.</em> 49).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The types of work that are forbidden on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> are those that take time to perform and occupy one’s thoughts, like sewing, mending clothing,
    repairing furniture, fixing electrical appliances, and commerce. However, tasks that take little time to complete, like lighting or extinguishing [a
    candle], tying or untying, and traveling for a necessary purpose, are permitted, because they do not distract one’s mind from mourning.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Writing is forbidden, because it is a distraction, but one may transcribe things that are related to <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is permissible to sell food items [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], so that people can have what they need for the meal after the fast. Starting midday, one
    may prepare for that meal. Some women have a custom to toil and clean the house after midday, in anticipation of <em>Mashiach</em>, who is [supposed to be]
    born on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. One should not denounce their actions (<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 559:7).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A Jew may instruct a non-Jew to do work for him on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. However, jobs that are done out in the open, like building a house or doing
    business in a store, are forbidden, because it looks like [the one who commissioned the work] is belittling the communal mourning (<em>M.B.</em> 554:46).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
One may perform a task on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> if delaying it will cause significant [monetary] loss, similar to the law on <em>Chol HaMo’ed</em> (    <em>Sh.A.</em> 554:23).

<a name="15"></a><h2>10.15 – The Reading of Eichah and Dimming the Lights </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We read <em>Eichah</em> after praying <em>Ma’ariv</em>. Many <em>Rishonim</em> hold that a blessing is recited over the reading of <em>Eichah</em>, but
many communities do not follow this practice. Moreover, many [<em>poskim</em>] maintain that even those who require a blessing agree that if<em>Eichah</em> is not written on parchment, like a Torah, no blessing is made. Nevertheless, few communities are careful to write the Scroll of    <em>Eichah</em> on parchment. In practice, [all] Sefardim and many Ashkenazim, including all Chassidm, read <em>Eichah</em> without a blessing; while some
    Ashkenazim – especially those who follow the Vilna Gaon’s practices – read it from a kosher scroll written on parchment and recite a blessing.
    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
It is customary to darken the Synagogue on the night of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, as it says, <em>He has settled me in darkness</em> (<em>Eichah</em> 3:6). The<em>Midrash</em> (<em>Eichah Rabbah</em> 1:1) similarly states that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels at the time of the    <em>churban</em>, “What does a human king do when he is mourning?” They replied, “He extinguishes the lamps.” [God] said to them, “I will do the same,” as
    it says, <em>The sun and moon became blackened</em> (<em>Yo’el</em> 2:10).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Already at the beginning of the night, we turn off some of the lights in the Synagogue, and it is fitting to do the same at home. The main thing to be
    meticulous about is to dim the lights in preparation for the reading of <em>Eichah</em>, because that is when they used to blow out all the candles, except
    for the few that were needed for the reading (<em>Sh.A.</em> 559:3). Now that we use electric lights, some have a custom to turn off all the lights before
    the reading and produce the necessary light with candles alone. Others keep a few electric lights on.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The [Rabbinic] institution to read <em>Eichah</em> in public primarily related to [reading it] at night, as it says (<em>Eichah</em> 1:2),    <em>She weeps sorely in the night</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em> and <em>Rama</em> 559:1-2). However, many people have a custom to read it again during the day,
    after the recitation of <em>Kinot</em>. In a place where the congregation does not read it [publically] during the day, it is proper for each individual to
    read it by himself (<em>M.B.</em> 559:2).
</p>
<a name="16"></a><h2>10.16 – Anneinu, Nacheim, the Priestly Blessings, and Tachanun </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The laws of reciting <em>Anneinu</em> [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>] are the same as those of the other fast days, as we explained above (7.10). As we learned
    [there], Sefardim are accustomed to saying it in all the silent prayers of the fast; therefore, on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, which begins at night, they say it
in <em>Ma’ariv</em>, <em>Shacharit</em>, and <em>Minchah</em>. According to Ashkenazi practice, however, the only silent prayer in which it is said is    <em>Minchah</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    [The Rabbis] instituted that <em>Nacheim</em> be added to the blessing of <em>Boneih Yerushalayim</em> whenever <em>Anneinu</em> is said. The conclusion of
    the blessing is changed, as well: <em>Menachem Tziyon b’vinyan Yerushalayim</em> (Sefardic version) or <em>Menachem Tziyon u’voneih Yerushalayim</em>
    (Ashkenazi and North African version). Indeed, the wording of <em>Nacheim</em> contains phrases that, seemingly, do not coincide with current-day
    Jerusalem, like: “[The city that is…] mournful without her children…desolate without inhabitants. She sits with her head covered, like a barren woman who
    has not given birth. Legions have devoured her and idolaters have taken possession of her.” However, we do not have the power to change the formulation
    that our Sages instituted. Besides which, we can – unfortunately – apply all this to the Temple Mount. Furthermore, compared to what Jerusalem should be –
    the capital of the world, the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the nations – it is considered destroyed and desolate.
    <button type="button" id="1020" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 20</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
One does not say <em>Tachanun</em> on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> or during the <em>Minchah</em> prayer on the eve of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because<em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is called a <em>mo’ed</em> (an appointed time), as it says (<em>Eichah</em> 1:15), <em>He has declared a set time against me</em> (    <em>Sh.A.</em> 559:4). (That is, a <em>mo’ed</em> is a special time; if we are worthy, it will be a holiday; if not, it will be a time of mourning.)
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In some communities, the <em>kohanim</em> (priests) do not spread their hands [to recite the priestly blessings] during <em>Shacharit</em> [of<em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], as it says, <em>When you spread your hands, I will hide My eyes from you</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 1:15). This is similar to [the    <em>halachah</em>] that a <em>kohen</em> who is in mourning does not “spread his hands,” because he is unhappy and [therefore] unable to bless [the
congregants] with peace. Most Ashkenazim and some Sefardim follow this custom. The <em>kohanim</em> of other communities do “spread their hands” during    <em>Shacharit</em>, and this is the custom of the Kabbalists in Jerusalem. Each community should continue following its own custom. According to all
customs, [the <em>kohanim</em>] recite the priestly blessings when praying <em>Minchah</em> towards evening (see <em>K.H.C.</em> 559:30,    <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 10:17, above 7.12).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We customarily pray [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>] like mourners do – patiently, in a soft voice, and without cantillation (<em>Rama</em> 559:1).
</p>
<a name="17"></a><h2>10.17 – Removing the Curtain from Before the Ark; Tallit and Tefillin </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
We remove the curtain from before the Holy Ark prior to the <em>Ma’ariv</em> service, as it says,    <em>The Lord has done what He planned; He has fulfilled His word</em> (<em>Eichah</em> 2:17), which <em>Chazal</em> interpret to mean that HaShem, as it
    were, tore His garment. By doing this, we demonstrate how low we have descended since the Temple was destroyed (<em>Rama</em> 559:2). We return the curtain
    to its proper place before praying <em>Minchah</em> (<em>K.H.C.</em> 19).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Many also have a custom not to wear their prayer shawls (<em>talit gadol</em>) or don their <em>tefillin</em> during <em>Shacharit</em> prayers. Just as    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, as it were, “<em>fulfilled His word</em>” – i.e., tore His garment – so too, we refrain from wearing a <em>talit</em>. And
    just as the verse states, <em>He cast down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel</em> (<em>Eichah</em> 2:1), which refers to God’s <em>tefillin</em>, so
too, we refrain from adorning ourselves with <em>tefillin</em>. However, since most <em>Rishonim</em> hold that the <em>mitzvah</em> of donning    <em>tefillin</em> takes affect on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> as it does on all other days, we wear <em>talit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> at <em>Minchah</em> time.
    [The Rabbis] chose to abstain from these <em>mitzvot</em> during <em>Shacharit</em> because that is when we demonstrate the height of our mourning and pain
    through the recitation of <em>Kinot</em>. By <em>Minchah</em> time, in contrast, we already accept some consolation. The Shulchan Aruch codifies [this
    practice] into law (555:1), and all Ashkenazi communities, as well as many Sefardic ones, follow it. One should wear his <em>talit kattan</em> [the small
    four-cornered garment usually worn under one’s shirt] from the beginning of the day [as usual], but it is uncertain whether a blessing is said when putting
    it on. Therefore, it is preferable to sleep in one’s <em>talit kattan</em> on the night of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>; this way, one will not have to recite the
    blessing in the morning. Only before <em>Minchah</em> will one recite the blessing, upon enwrapping himself in his large <em>talit</em> (prayer shawl).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are some meticulous Jews who do not want to read the <em>Shema</em> without wearing a <em>talit</em> and <em>tefillin</em>. Therefore, they put them
    on at home, before <em>Shacharit</em>, read the <em>Shema</em>, and then go to pray with the congregation, without <em>talit</em> and <em>tefillin</em>.
    Some Sefardic communities wear <em>talit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> during <em>Shacharit</em>, [as usual]. Each community should continue observing its
    custom.

<a name="18"></a><h2>10.18 – Words of Torah in our Prayers and the Blessing of <em>SheAsah Li Kol Tzorki</em> </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Most of the passages that we say in the framework of <em>Korbanot</em> (Sacrifices) are included [in our prayers] for two reasons: 1) [to serve] as a
    substitute for [actual] sacrifices and a preparation for prayer, 2) to give every Jew the opportunity to learn Torah every day – [by reciting] verses from
    Scriptures, <em>Mishnayot</em>, and Talmudic statements. Consequently, on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, when one is forbidden to study Torah, the question arises,
    is it permissible to recite these passages? Many [<em>poskim</em>] hold that the main purpose of any part of our liturgy is prayer-related and one is,
    therefore, allowed to recite it on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. The Sefardim, as well as some Ashkenazim, follow this viewpoint. Other [authorities] maintain that
    on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> one is permitted to say only what he says on a regular basis in his prayers. He should not, however, say that which he does not
    usually say in the section of <em>Korbanot</em>.

    Some people are accustomed to saying several chapters of <em>Tehillim</em> every day, such that they complete the entire book once a month. Some
    [authorities] say that one may recite these daily chapters on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, after midday. Others maintain that it is better to push it off until
    after the fast (<em>M.B.</em> 554:7, <em>K.H.C.</em> 20).

    One of the blessings we say in the morning is <em>SheAsah Li Kol Tzorki</em>, in which we thank God for providing us with shoes to wear. Even though it is
    forbidden to wear leather shoes on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> and <em>Yom Kippur</em>, Ashkenazim and some Sefardim say the blessing, because it is a general
    expression of thanksgiving for the normal way of the world, not for the shoes one wears on any particular day. Moreover, one is permitted to wear
    non-leather shoes on these days. Furthermore, we put on [regular] shoes after the fast is over, and some say that the blessings we say in the morning apply
    to the night, as well. According to the Ari, however, one should not recite this blessing on [these] fast days. Most Sefardim follow this viewpoint.
    <button type="button" id="1024" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 24</button>

<p dir="LTR">
    On the night of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, one is permitted to say the entire order of <em>Kri’at Shema Al HaMittah</em> (the recitation of <em>Shema</em>
    before going to sleep), because the verses included therein are said for the purpose of prayer, not Torah study.
</p>
<a name="19"></a><h2>10.19 – The Laws of the Tenth of Av </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Babylonians conquered the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> on the seventh of Av, setting it ablaze on the ninth of the month, late in the day, and it continued
    burning throughout the tenth of Av. Rabbi Yochanan commented that had he been alive at the time, he would have established the fast on the tenth of Av,
    because most of the Temple burned on that day. Some <em>Amora’im</em> (Talmudic Sages) adopted a stringency to fast on both the ninth and the tenth of Av.
However, the prophets and sages established the fast on the ninth, because everything follows the beginning, and the disaster began on the ninth of Av (    <em>Ta’anit</em> 29a, <em>Yerushalmi Ta’anit</em> 4:6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Nonetheless, since the majority of the Temple actually burned on the tenth of Av, the people of Israel have a custom not to eat meat or drink wine on that
date. According to Sefardic custom, the prohibition lasts the entire day, while Ashkenazim observe this custom only until midday (<em>Sh.A.</em> and    <em>Rama</em> 558:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Most <em>Acharonim</em> maintain that, in addition to refraining from meat and wine, one may not wash clothes, wear freshly laundered garments, take
    haircuts, listen to joyous music, or bathe in hot water on the tenth of Av. One may, however, wash oneself with lukewarm water. Some [authorities] rule
    leniently, prohibiting only the consumption of meat and wine, while permitting bathing, haircutting, and laundering, without limitation. Ideally, one
    should follow the stricter opinion, but one may act leniently under pressing circumstances.
    <button type="button" id="1025" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 25</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Another [prevalent] custom is not to say the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing on the tenth of Av, as is the law during the Three Weeks (<em>Chida</em>,    <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 558:8; see above 8.7-8).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    When the tenth of Av falls out on a Friday, one is allowed to take a haircut, do laundry, and bathe, in preparation for the Sabbath, starting from the
    morning. And if one is pressed for time, he may even start preparing immediately after <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> ends (<em>M.B.</em> 558:3, <em>A.H.S.</em>
    558:2. In the next <em>halachah</em> [10.20], we will discuss the laws of the night after the fast when [the fast] is postponed).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The custom is to postpone <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> (the Blessing of the Moon) until after the fast [of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], because the blessing must be
    recited joyously, and we decrease our joy during the Nine Days. Many people are accustomed to saying it immediately after the <em>Ma’ariv</em> prayer at
    the conclusion of the fast, but it is improper to do so, <em>le’chatchilah</em>. After all, it is difficult to be happy then, when we have yet to drink,
    eat, wash our faces and hands, or put on [regular] shoes. Therefore, [each community] should set a time – an hour or two after the fast – for the
    recitation of <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em>, and in the meantime, everyone will [have a chance to] eat something and wash up. This way, they will be able to
    say the blessing joyously. Where there is concern that pushing off <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> may cause some people to forget to say it, [the congregation]
    may say it immediately after the fast, but it is best to take a drink and wash one’s face beforehand.

<p dir="LTR">
    When <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> falls out on <em>Shabbat</em>, it is postponed until Sunday. On that <em>Shabbat</em>, we show no [outward] signs of mourning;
    rather, we eat and drink like we do on any other <em>Shabbat</em>, even feasting like King Shlomo did in his day (see above 9.4).

<p dir="LTR">
    As we learned above (10.4), pregnant and nursing women must fast on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. On a postponed fast, however, the law is more lenient, and if
    they feel slightly weak or if they experience some type of pain, they are exempt from fasting, even though they are not [actually] ill (<em>B.H.</em>
    559:9, s.v. <em>ve’eino</em>; <em>K.H.C.</em> 75).

<p dir="LTR">
    The main participants of a <em>brit milah</em> [the father, the <em>mohel</em>, and the <em>sandak</em>] must fast on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, but the law is
    more lenient when <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> falls out on <em>Shabbat</em> and the fast is postponed until Sunday. According to most <em>poskim</em>, these
    participants may pray <em>Minchah</em> after midday, perform the circumcision immediately afterwards, and then eat and drink. Some <em>poskim</em> rule

    after the fast, and one is allowed to take a haircut, do laundry, and bathe in hot water once the stars emerge. However, many [authorities] maintain that
    one should refrain from eating meat and drinking wine that night. Since everyone fasted during the day, it is improper to immediately rejoice by consuming
    meat and wine (<em>Rama</em> 558:1, <em>M.B.</em> 4-5, Rav [Mordechai] Eliyahu’s<em> Hilchot Chagim</em> 29:9). Others permit the consumption of meat and

    As is true regarding all other <em>mitzvot</em>, we are commanded to educate our children to keep the <em>mitzvot</em> relating to <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> and
    mourning over the <em>churban</em>. Since children are weak, however, it is impossible to teach them to fast [when they are young]. Therefore, we train
them to fast a few hours, depending on their strength, only starting from age nine. They should not fast the entire day (Rama of Panow 111; see    <em>K.H.C.</em> 554:23). When feeding children [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], one should give them only simple foods, in order to teach them to join with the
    community in mourning (<em>M.B.</em> 550:5). Many people are careful to teach their children who have reached the age of <em>chinuch</em> (education) –
    from around six years old – not to eat or drink on the night of the fast.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    At the age of <em>chinuch</em>… when a child begins to understand the story of the destruction and the [concept of] mourning over it, we teach him or her
    not to wear leather sandals or shoes and not to apply ointments or bathe for the sake of pleasure. Some act strictly in this regard even from the age of
    two or three. Even though children of this age do not understand the concept of mourning, [these acts nonetheless symbolize] a sharing in [the Jewish
    people’s] anguish and demonstrate our grief over the <em>churban</em>, seeing that even small children participate, in some way, in our mourning.

    [As mentioned] above (10.10), one is forbidden to study Torah [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], because it brings a person joy, and one may only learn sad topics
related to the destruction of the Temple and the laws of mourning. The same applies to teaching children: adults may only teach them topics related to the    <em>churban</em> and mourning. Some say that adults may not teach children even those topics and laws related to the <em>churban</em>, because adults feel
    joy when they teach children. [According to these authorities], the only thing one may do is tell them the story of the destruction (<em>M.B.</em> 554:2;
    see <em>K.H.C.</em> 8). Since these two opinions are equally [represented], every person may choose which one he wants to follow. Everyone agrees, however,
    that a minor may learn, on his own, whatever an adult may learn.

See above, 7:1-2, with note 1, [where we explained] that the definition of “peace” is when the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> is built; only then will            <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> be canceled. My assertion that [the obligation to fast on] <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> does not depend on Israel’s will is taken from
            the Ramban’s <em>Torat HaAdam</em>, p. 244. This is also the opinion of Rashi, the Eshkol, the Itur, the Smak, the Maggid Mishnah, and others.
            However, there are those – the Rashba and the Ritva – who hold that in the intermediate situation, [when the Temple is still destroyed, but evil
            decrees have ceased], we are exempt from fasting on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, as well. It’s just that the Jews decided to observe <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>
            as a full fast, in accordance with the original enactment, because of the numerous tragedies that occurred on that day. Nonetheless, the accepted
            practice is to rule like the majority of <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em>, [who hold] that the fast of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is not
            dependent on [anyone’s] will. Rather, it is an obligation instituted by the prophets. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em>, pp. 3-4 and 246, [where the
            author] lists the various opinions [on this issue].

            Some rule stringently on this issue: <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em>, 554:6, quotes [the author of] <em>Pitchei Olam</em> as saying that in a place where
            cholera is not rampant and the doctors say that people must eat in order to avoid catching the disease, one should eat portions that are less that
            the minimum measure on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. We also find several <em>Acharonim</em> who hold that [the sick] should preferably eat less than the
minimum measure, to avoid breaking the fast, so that they can say <em>Anneinu</em> and <em>Nachem</em> (these <em>Acharonim</em> are cited in            <em>S’dei Chemed</em> and in <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>, vol. 10, sec. 25, chap. 16, paragraph 2). Similarly, the Mishnah Berurah (554:14) says in the
            name of the Eliyah Rabbah that a postpartum woman should preferably fast for a few hours, if possible. The Chatam Sofer, <em>O.C.</em> 157,
            concurs, saying that if a sick person can suffice with just drinking, he should not eat, and if eating once will satisfy his needs, he should not
            eat twice. According to Maharil Diskin, <em>Kuntas Acharon</em> 75, there is room to be strict in this matter, not as far as the obligation to fast
            is concerned, but in order to avoid separating from the community.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In practice, though, we rule that sick people need not fast a few hours, nor do they need to eat portions that are less than the minimum measure.
            So writes the Aruch HaShulchan 554:7 (end). Furthermore, when the Bi’ur Halachah said that one should eat less than the minimum measure, he was
            speaking about a person who is not considered sick at all. The authors of <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> (4:554) and <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> (vol. 10,
            25:16) concur. For additional sources, see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 554:9. See also R. Karp’s [work], <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:15, 7:21*.
            However, several <em>poskim</em> write that it is proper not to eat at night, as cited in <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 554:45, 556:21.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In practice: if a sick person wants to be strict on himself and eat portions that are less than the minimum measure, he can say <em>Anneinu</em>
            and <em>Nachem</em> [in the <em>Minchah</em> prayer]. However, according to the law, there is no need to do so. Nevertheless, there are sick people
            who prefer drinking less than the minimum measure, in order to participate in the fast. Sometimes, when there is a question whether someone is sick
            or not, like a pregnant woman who feels weak and is afraid to fast, I instruct him or her to eat and drink portions that are less than the minimum
            measure, in accordance with the words of the Bi’ur Halachah.

            Indeed, the Rama (554:6) writes that a woman should fast seven days after childbirth, unless she is in great pain. And the Mishnah Berurah (554:14)
            quotes the Magen Avraham as saying that she may act leniently only if <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> is postponed [because it fell out on <em>Shabbat</em>].
            Nevertheless, the Aruch HaShulchan (554:7) writes that nowadays a woman should not, God forbid, fast within thirty days of giving birth. Other
Ashkenazi <em>poskim</em> rule this way, as well. A woman who acts leniently in this regard does not forfeit anything. See R. Karp’s [work] 7:6 and            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 554:7. Regarding a woman who has a miscarriage, see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 617:5.

            Many Ashkenazi <em>poskim</em> hold that one says <em>Nachem</em> before the words <em>U’venei Yerushalayim</em> (<em>Rama</em> 557:1). Others
            raise doubts about this, [claiming] that [<em>Chazal</em>] never instituted the saying [of <em>Nachem</em> in <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>] (Gra,
            quoted in <em>M.B.</em> 557:5). Still others say that the best advice is to say it after the [four] blessings [of <em>Birkat HaMazone</em>] are
            finished, together with the <em>HaRachaman</em> prayers (<em>K.H.C.</em> 557:11).

            There are those who rule that if a pregnant woman suffers as a result of extraordinarily hot weather, she is exempt from fasting (Rabbi S. Z.
            Auerbach). Others are even more lenient, exempting all pregnant women [from fasting altogether], either because heat waves [can occur] or because
people in general are weaker nowadays (as cited in <em>Halichot Beitah</em> 25, note 3). Nevertheless, I wrote [above] the practical            <em>halachah</em> according to the letter of the law, as formulated in the <em>Gemara</em> (<em>Pesachim</em> 54b), the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,
and the <em>Acharonim</em>. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 7:3, <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 554:5, <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:4, and            <em>Torat HaYoledet</em> 48:4:6.

            A mother who feeds her baby breast milk alone, and her milk diminishes when she fasts, should stop fasting and feed her baby properly if she is
            unable to get him to drink milk substitutes or sweetened water from a bottle. Similarly, a woman who is concerned that fasting might cause her milk
            to stop altogether, making her unable to nurse anymore, should not fast. The author of <em>Torat HaYoledet</em> (48:4) writes that such a woman
            should drink portions less than the minimum measure, because she is not [really] sick, and the only reason she needs to drink is for her baby.

            The <em>mitzvah</em> for a <em>niddah</em> (menstrual woman) to immerse herself in a <em>mikveh</em> at the first halachically-acceptable
opportunity does not override the prohibition against washing on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. Similarly, a man who is accustomed to immersing in a            <em>mikveh</em> in order to remove <em>keri</em> defilement (caused by the emission of semen) may not immerse on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because a
            pious custom does not override the prohibition against washing (<em>B.Y.</em>, <em>Sh.A.</em> 554:8, 613:11).

            According to most <em>poskim</em>, one need not wash one’s hands more than once after using the bathroom; but some people are accustomed to washing
            three times (see <em>M.B.</em> 4:39). Those who always wash three times may do so on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, as well, because this washing is for the
            sake of purification and a <em>mitzvah</em>, not pleasure. (See <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 8.3-5. Also see note 2, where R.

            Some say that a person who touches a covered part of the body with one finger should wash only that hand until the upper knuckles (<em>Ch.A.</em>
            40:18, <em>M.B.</em> 613:6). Others hold that he must wash both hands (<em>Shelah</em>, <em>Yafeh LaLev</em>; see also <em>K.H.C.</em> 4:86). The
            same authorities dispute a case in which someone touches his shoe – even if it is made of cloth – with one finger. There are many other
            uncertainties regarding these laws. For example, does someone who touches a normally-covered area that [nonetheless] has no sweat particles need to
            wash his hands (see <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 5, note 2)? Furthermore, according to the letter of the law, one who touches body
parts that are usually covered may [simply] rub his hands [on anything that cleans] and then say words of holiness (<em>Sh.A.</em> 4:23,            <em>M.B.</em> 61). Why, then, do we not do so on <em>Yom Kippur</em> and <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>? In practice, it appears that if, in a specific
            situation, one generally acts strictly throughout the year and washes his hands, he should also wash them on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, for he is doing
            so for the sake of a <em>mitzvah</em>. If, however, he sometimes makes do with rubbing his hands on his clothing [or the like], he should do the
            same on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. If someone touches a normally-covered area of his body and now wants to pray, he should wash his hands, because that
            is the <em>halachah</em>, as explained in <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 5.2. One who touches a usually-covered area [of the body]
            with one finger while using the facilities should wash both hands; and it seems that everyone would agree with this. After all, many authorities
hold that one must wash both hands upon leaving a bathroom, even if he did not relieve himself or touch a normally-covered body part (see            <em>B.H.</em> 613:3). One who touches mud with his finger should wash only the soiled area, because there is no evil spirit here that spreads to
            the rest of the hand. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 613:2.

            The Bi’ur Halachah (554:15) explains that there is a distinction between <em>Yom Kippur</em> and <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> regarding the prohibition of
            anointing. On <em>Yom Kippur</em>, the prohibition also includes non-pleasurable anointing, as the <em>Yerushalmi</em> indicates. Therefore, one
            may not apply, on <em>Yom Kippur</em>, a salve for the purpose of removing filth. On <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, however, the prohibition is a function
            of the laws of mourning. Therefore, only anointing for the sake of pleasure is prohibited, while anointing in order to remove filth is permissible.
            The Bi’ur Halachah thus rejects the opinion of the Mateh Yehudah, who equates <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> and <em>Yom Kippur</em> in regard to this
            prohibition.

            The author of <em>Shiyurei Knesset HaGedolah</em> (551, 567) writes that it is forbidden to smoke on fast days, because smoking alleviates the
            anxiety of the <em>churban</em> and generates a feeling of satiation; it even causes a desecration of God’s name, for the Gentiles refrain from
            smoking on their fast days. According to many [other <em>poskim</em>], however, there is no prohibition against smoking, from the perspective of
            the fast day, especially for someone who needs it to relieve agitation. The Mishnah Berurah (555:8) permits smoking after midday, in private, for
one who needs it. Many others allow it even before midday, in private, for one who needs it. [R. Ovadyah Yosef] cites [these <em>poskim</em>] in            <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 1:33. The author of <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> (7:87) writes that the authorities who forbid smoking are not referring to
            cigarettes, but to a type of smoking that entails more pleasure and involvement; see there. However, now that it has become clear that smoking is
            detrimental to a person’s health, it is forbidden to accustom oneself to smoking, and one who is already addicted must do everything he can to
            quit.

            According to Rashi and Rabbeinu Yerucham, the prohibition applies to wooden shoes as well, because their soles are hard and one who walks in them
            does not feel the roughness of the road. R. Zerachyah HaLevi (Razah) holds that any shoe that protects the feet is prohibited, no matter what
            material it is made of. The Talmud’s statement (<em>Yoma</em> 78b) that cork and rubber [shoes] are permissible [does not contradict this], for
            they did not protect the feet like [regular] shoes did. According to these [authorities], one may not wear shoes or sandals in which people
            regularly walk, even if they are made from materials other [than leather]. It is possible to infer from [the words of] other <em>Rishonim</em>, as
            well, that one may not wear good shoes in which the roughness of the road cannot be felt, no matter what material they are made of. However, the
            Beit Yosef writes (614:2) that the Rif and the Rosh hold that the prohibition applies only to leather shoes, as the simple reading of the Gemara
            indicates. This is [his] conclusion in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, as well. The author of <em>Responsa Maharshag</em> (2:113) also explains [the
            matter] this way, as does the Ari [z”l], who explains why leather alone is forbidden: because “it is the secret of the skin garments of Original
            Man (Adam) [which were made from] the skin of the snake” (<em>Pri Etz Chayim</em>, <em>Sha’ar Yom HaKippurim</em>, chap. 4). I would add that
            leather shoes and sandals are considered superior even today. See <em>Hilchot Chag B’Chag</em>, 23:48 and 23:26, where R. Karp is inclined to rule
            strictly. [See] also <em>Ohalah Shel Torah</em>, <em>O.C.</em> 81. R. [Shlomo Zalman] Auerbach permits [shoes made of] other materials, because we
are sensitive [nowadays], but he rules strictly when it comes to synthetic leather (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 5:16-17). R. [Mordechai] Eliyahu (            <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 45:38-39) is also inclined to rule leniently, as is the author of <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (13:10). These authorities rule
            leniently regarding <em>Yom Kippur</em>, which entails a possible Torah [transgression], all the more so regarding <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>.

        <p dir="LTR">
            Wooden shoes that are overlaid with leather are forbidden according to all opinions (<em>Sh.A.</em> 614:2). Many [<em>poskim</em>] hold that there
            is no prohibition [against wearing] sandals that have but one, thin strap of leather on top (<em>K.H.C.</em> 614:10).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
For more on one who needs to wear leather shoes, see R. Eliyahu’s <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 45:41-42; <em>Minchat Shlomo</em> vol. 1, 91:25:8;            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em>, <em>Hilchot Yom HaKippurim</em> 23:55, 58.

            The author of <em>Responsa Chelkat Ya’akov</em> (2:83) permits one who wears orthotics lined with leather to insert them into canvas or rubber
            shoes, provided that the person suffers greatly when walking without orthotics. His reasoning: the orthotics are not part of the shoe, making the
            situation similar to one who stands on a leather cushion, which is permitted (<em>Rama</em> 614:2). Furthermore, since [failure to wear orthotics
            would cause] the person great pain, he can be compared to one who [needs to] walk through mud. See also R. Eliyahu’s <em>Hilchot Chagim</em>
            45:41-42; <em>Minchat Shlomo</em>, vol. 1, 91:25:8; <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em>, <em>Hilchot Yom HaKippurim</em> 23:55, 58.

            <em>Sh.A.</em>
            554:18. Two conjoined beds are considered one. The <em>Acharonim</em> write that one should act stringently on <em>Tish’a B’Av </em>with regard to
            all the precautionary measures [that couples keep] during the <em>niddah</em> period, just as one does on <em>Yom Kippur</em> (<em>Sh.A.</em>
            615:1). According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, one should act stringently both on the day and night of <em>Yom Kippur</em>. The Taz holds
            that one need not be strict during the day of <em>Yom Kippur</em>. When it comes to <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, however, many <em>poskim</em> write that
            one need not be careful during the day, because everyone is mourning and the women do not adorn themselves; therefore, there is no reason to fear
            that [contact between husband and wife] will lead to sexual intercourse (<em>M.B.</em> 554:37, <em>K.H.C.</em> 85). There are those who rule
            strictly even during the day when it comes to touching (<em>Kitzur Sh.A.</em> 124:12, <em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 26:49). Either way, it seems [to me]
            that everyone agrees that affectionate touching is forbidden even during the day, as is sleeping in the same bed.

The source for these <em>halachot</em> is <em>Ta’anit</em> 30a and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 554:1-3. Regarding works of <em>mussar</em>: some [            <em>poskim</em>] say that if a book cites verses and statements of <em>Chazal</em>, one is forbidden to study it (see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em>
554:2). However, the essential ruling is that it is permissible, as the Meiri maintains. The authors of <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (8:18) and            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> (7:57) write likewise in the name of Rabbi Elyashiv. They also explain the different opinions as to what is considered
            in-depth study, which is forbidden. It seems [to me] that one is forbidden [to study] if the goal is to come up with novel interpretations and
            understand the deep meaning [of a passage], but if the purpose is to understand [the matter] on a simple level, it is permissible.

            The <em>Tosefta</em> (Ta’anit 3:11) states, “One may not extend a greeting to <em>Chaveirim</em> (Torah Jews) on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, but [one may
say it] in a soft voice to a simple person.” Some understand [this to mean] that the prohibition applies only to Torah scholars, who are called            <em>Chaveirim</em>. This appears to be the Rambam’s viewpoint, as the Bach understands it. However, the Mordechai (<em>Mo’ed Kattan</em> 895)
            presents a different version of the <em>Tosefta</em>: “One may not extend a greeting to his friend (<em>chaveiro</em>).” The Shulchan Aruch
            (554:20) rules in accordance with this [version], [stating] that one may not extend greetings on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, and that one who is greeted
            by someone unfamiliar with the <em>halachah</em> should answer in a soft voice. Virtually all the <em>Acharonim</em> concur. Nonetheless, we
learned that one should not bring the matter to a simpleton’s attention, for there are those who say that he is not obligated in this [            <em>halachah</em>]. See R. Karp’s work, 7:72. Also see <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 8:22.

            The Maharil sat directly on the ground, but since there is no obligation [to do so], the Magen Avraham (559:2) allows one to sit on a cushion. The
            [Chafetz Chayim], in <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 11 and <em>Sha’ar HaTziyun</em> 9, permits one to sit on a low bench, when necessary. The Ben Ish
            Chai (<em>Devarim</em> 20) writes that it should be no higher than a <em>tefach</em>. Many are lenient up to three <em>tefachim</em>, which is
considered still attached to the ground, and the Chazon Ish permits even more than three <em>tefachim</em>. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 559:4 and            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:65:92. Regarding the Kabbalistic custom [not to sit directly on the ground], see <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 552:39, which
says that there is no obligation to put a separation on tiled floors. However, it is best to act stringently, when possible. See            <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 10:2 and <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:66.

The Shulchan Aruch implies that the custom-based prohibition to do work applies the entire day of <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. [The author of]            <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (8:24) concurs, writing that this is the Sefardic custom. From the wording of the Kaf HaChayim (554:97), however, it does
            not seem that there is a compulsory custom in this regard. I did not get involved in this issue [above] because, anyway, it is proper to refrain
from work in the afternoon. The distinction [I made between various types of work] based on the duration [of the task] is found in            <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> and <em>Rama</em> 554:22, and its logic is that when something takes time [to execute], it causes one to forget that he
            is mourning. This is the criterion upon which every question should be decided. The <em>Acharonim</em> debate whether it is permissible to write
            [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], as the Bi’ur Halachah (s.v. <em>al</em>) and Kaf HaChayim (110) demonstrate. I stated [above, that writing is forbidden]
            based on the rationale behind the <em>halachah</em>, that it all depends on [whether the task causes] a distraction from mourning. If one is
            concerned that he will forget a novel idea [he came up with], he may write it down, in accordance with the law [that permits one to do] work in a
            situation of potential loss.

            Tractate <em>Sofrim</em> (14:3) states clearly that a blessing is recited over the reading of <em>Eichah</em>. Or Zaru’a, Shibolei HaLeket,
            HaManhig, and others concur. The Beit Yosef (559:2) writes that people do not customarily recite a blessing. See also <em>Rama</em>, <em>O.C.</em>

One who forgets to say <em>Nacheim</em> [in its proper place] should say it in the blessing pertaining to the Temple service [<em>Retzeih</em>] (            <em>B.H.</em> 557). If one forgets [to insert it there as well], he should say it in <em>Elokai Netzor</em>. And if one [remembers only after]
            completing the entire <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, he should not pray again in order to say <em>Nacheim</em>.

            According to the Ra’avad, one should not wear <em>tefillin</em> on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, just like a mourner does not wear <em>tefillin</em> on his
            first day of mourning. Others maintain that although there is no obligation to wear <em>tefillin</em> on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, there is also no
            prohibition to do so. The Me’iri quotes this in the name of “a few sages,” and the Maggid Mishnah explains this to be the Rambam’s opinion (in
terms of the head <em>tefillin</em>). The Ramban, Rashba, Rosh, and most of the <em>Rishonim</em> hold that one is obligated to wear<em>tefillin</em> on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. The prevalent custom, as cited in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 555:1, is not to wear them until            <em>Minchah</em>. Similarly, the Maharam of Rotenberg and other <em>Rishonim</em> are quoted as saying that during <em>Shacharit</em> one should
            act as a first-day mourner [and refrain from donning <em>tefillin</em>], but after <em>Minchah</em> time, one must put on his <em>tefillin</em>, as
if it is an ordinary day. Many great Sefardic sages, as well as a few Ashkenazi <em>gedolim</em>, were careful to wear their <em>talit</em> and            <em>tefillin</em> before <em>Shacharit</em> prayers, in order to read the <em>Shema</em> in the best possible way; afterwards, they would go to the
synagogue and pray with the congregation, without <em>talit</em> and <em>tefillin</em>. This was the custom of Maharam Galanti. The Ben Ish Chai (<em>Devarim</em> 25) and R. Chayim Palagi write that everyone should adopt this practice. Some communities prayed together while wearing their<em>talitot</em> and <em>tefillin</em>. The author of <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em> writes that this was the custom in Salonika, and the author of<em>Shulchan Gavo’ah</em> says that this was the custom in Izmir. The Kabbalists of Beit El in Jerusalem also followed this custom, as cited in<em>Kaf HaChayim</em> 555:4. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 10:15, <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:48. If one whose father’s custom is to wear<em>tefillin</em> during <em>Shacharit</em> in the synagogue prays in a <em>minyan</em> where they do not wear them, he should don            <em>tefillin</em> at home, read <em>Shema</em>, and then go to the synagogue and pray with the congregation, without <em>tefillin</em>.

            The Shulchan Aruch (554:3) states that one may say the entire order of daily prayer, even the <em>Midrash</em> of Rabbi Yishma’el. The Aruch
            HaShulchan (554:6) concurs. The Rama (559:4) writes that one should not say <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>. See <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:44, where
            [the author] explains that [the Rama] is referring to the <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> at the end of <em>Shacharit</em>, for not everyone is accustomed
            to saying it. The Mishnah Berurah (554:7), however, implies that [the Rama’s statement] refers to the <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> said before the
            prayer service. Either way, it seems from the Mishnah Berurah that the rule is as follows: whatever people regularly say in their daily prayers may
            be said on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> as well. This is the second opinion I mentioned above. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 554:4, <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em>
            8:19.

            The Taz permits one to recite the daily portion of the <em>parashah</em> – <em>sh’nayim mikra ve’echad targum</em> – [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], and
there are those who rely on his opinion, like Chabad Chassidim with regard to <em>Chitat</em> (<em>Chumash</em>, <em>Tehillim</em>, and            <em>Tanya</em>). However, the overwhelming majority of <em>Acharonim</em> do not accept this viewpoint, as the Sha’ar HaTziyun (554:11) explains.
            Similarly, one should not read the daily portion of <em>Chok LeYisrael</em> or <em>Ma’amadot</em>, as the Birkei Yosef (554:5) and Mishnah Berurah
            (554:7) write. One whose loved one is ill may say <em>Tehillim</em> on his behalf, even before midday, because it [is being said] for a special
            reason (<em>Divrei Malki’el</em> 6:9; <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 8:19, end of note).

            The Rosh, Ran, and Tur (<em>O.C.</em> 613) are of the opinion that one should recite <em>SheAsah Li Kol Tzorki</em> on <em>Yom Kippur</em>, and the
            Mishnah Berurah (554:31) agrees. According to the Rambam, however, one does not recite the blessing, because he holds that one does not recite a
            blessing [on something] unless he derives pleasure from it, as the Beit Yosef (<em>O.C.</em> 613) explains. The Vilna Gaon followed this custom,
            but he would say the blessing after the fast, upon putting on his [regular] shoes (<em>Ma’aseh Rav</em> 9). In general, the Ari’s custom was to
            recite blessings even [upon things] from which one derives no pleasure (see <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 9:3), but he said that one
            should not recite [certain] blessings on fast days, and that is what his followers do in practice, as quoted in <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> (46:17). The
author of <em>Rav Po’alim</em> (2:8) writes that the blessing should not be recited even after the fast is completed. See            <em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em> 7:36. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (10:14) where the author mentions the accepted Sefardic ruling not to recite the
            blessing on fast days, but he adds that those who do say it have [authorities] upon whom to rely. At the end of the footnote, he writes that his
            father, the brilliant R. Ovadyah Yosef, is actually accustomed to saying the blessing.

            The ones who rule strictly are the Maharshal, Bach, Magen Avraham, Eliyah Rabbah, and others. Many people think that the Ashkenazim act stringently
            on this matter while the Sefardim act leniently. However, this is not apparent from the <em>Acharonim</em>. Many Sefardic [<em>poskim</em>]
prohibit laundering, bathing, and haircutting [on the tenth of Av]; these include the Chida (<em>Machazik Berachah</em> 558:1), R. Chayim Palagi (<em>Mo’ed LeChol Chai</em> 10:92), and the Kaf HaChayim (558:6). The authors of <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em> (<em>HaGahot Tur</em> 558) and            <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em> rule leniently. The Bi’ur Halachah writes that one may rely on the lenient opinion under pressing circumstances. This
viewpoint is shared by the majority of <em>poskim</em>. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 558:2. [R. Ovadyah Yosef] rules leniently in            <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em> (5:41), while R. [Mordechai] Eliyahu rules stringently (<em>Hilchot Chagim</em> 29:3), adding that one who refrains from
            laundering, bathing, etc. the entire day of the tenth [of Av] is praiseworthy. The Kaf HaChayim (558:10) concurs.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In general, the status of the tenth of Av is like that of the Nine Days – according to Ashkenazi custom – although slightly more lenient. During
            the Nine Days, the custom is to limit the number of people invited to a <em>mitzvah</em>-oriented meal in which meat and wine are served. On the
            tenth of Av, however, we make no such limits (<em>M.B.</em> 558:2). Some <em>chassidim</em> have a custom to make a <em>siyum</em> on the night
            after <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because hidden deep in the day’s essence is happiness, for the redemption begins then; see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em>
            558:1. [The <em>poskim</em>] also permit one to eat a cooked dish that has the taste of meat after the fast (<em>B.H.</em> 558:2). It is proper to
            refrain from marital relations on the night of the tenth, unless [the wife] immersed in a <em>mikvah</em> that night or [the husband] is going on a
            trip [the next day] (<em>M.B.</em> 558:2, <em>K.H.C.</em> 558:7).

            We already mentioned this <em>halachah</em> above, 1.16. According to the Maharil, <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> should be moved to another day. The
            Rama (426:2) writes that if <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> falls out on a Thursday, <em>Birkat HaLevanah</em> should be postponed until Saturday night, but
            if [the fast] falls out on any other day, [the blessing] should be recited the next night. However, most <em>Acharonim</em> write that one should
            not delay the <em>mitzvah</em>. Rather, one must sanctify the New Moon immediately after <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>. The following works express this
            viewpoint: <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em>, <em>Pri Chadash</em>, <em>Chida</em>, <em>Chayei Adam</em>, and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (426:11). Some add
another reason: we are slightly happy on the night after <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, because [our tradition tells us that] <em>Mashiach</em> is born on            <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>; therefore, it is fitting to sanctify the moon then. Nonetheless, the Mishnah Berurah (ibid.) and other <em>Acharonim</em>
write that it is proper to eat and put on [regular] shoes before [reciting the blessing]. See <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 11:1,            <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 551:31, and above 1.16.

            The Shulchan Aruch (554:19) writes that when <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> coincides with <em>Shabbat</em>, one is permitted to do all [that is ordinarily
            forbidden to be done on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], even marital relations. The Rama, however, says that one should refrain from such relations, for
            [acts that constitute] private mourning remain forbidden [on that <em>Shabbat</em>], because [refraining from them] does not diminish the honor of
            the Sabbath. The Mishnah Berurah (40) writes – based on the Shelah and the Magen Avraham – that if a woman goes to the <em>mikvah</em> [that Friday
            night], thus making it a <em>mitzvah</em> to have marital relations, then even those who [usually] follow the Rama’s customs would rely on the
            Shulchan Aruch’s opinion.

            postponed fast day. Other [<em>poskim</em>] forbid this; see <em>K.H.C.</em> 559:74 and <em>M.A.</em> 559:11. Most authorities, however, hold the
            more lenient opinion; so claim the Mishnah Berurah and [the author of] <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> (2:5). In practice, though, many communities act
            strictly. The author of <em>Knesset HaGedolah</em> writes that the Jews of Turkey acted strictly; the author of <em>Shulchan Gavo’ah</em> writes
            that this was also the custom in Salonika; and <em>Responsa Pe’ulat Tzaddik</em> (3:147) cites this as being the custom in Yemen. The Aruch
            HaShulchan (559:9) writes, “We have never seen or heard of anyone” making a meal on a postponed <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>, or even on one of the minor
            fasts [that was postponed]. See <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 559:9. (Regarding the previous <em>halachah</em>: the author of <em>Yechaveh Da’at</em>,
            3:40, rules leniently… even if [the woman] feels no pain [at all].)

            Actually, with regard to <em>Yom Kippur</em>, the Shulchan Aruch (616:1) rules that children must observe only the prohibition against wearing
            shoes – because doing so does not cause that much pain – while washing and anointing are permitted. Nonetheless, the reason for this leniency is
            that people used to wash and anoint young children in order to foster growth. Today, however, when we do not follow such a practice, it seems that
            washing and anointing are forbidden just like wearing shoes is. <em>Nit’ei Gavri’el</em> 69:2, 73:3 advances this logic. The Chochmat Adam (152:17)
            writes that one need not train children [on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em>], even with relation to wearing shoes, because we educate children [to observe
            these laws] only on <em>Yom Kippur</em>, but on <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> and in cases of personal mourning, there is no need to do so, if it entails
            even a small degree of pain. The Magen Avraham (551:38), however, asserts that we educate children [to keep the laws of] public mourning. The
            Mishnah Berurah (551:81) concurs, adding that there are two reasons why [adults] may not give haircuts [to children during the Nine Days]: 1) for
            educational purposes – accordingly, the prohibition starts at age six; and 2) to generate feelings of sorrow among the adults – in which case the
            prohibition starts even before then. The author of <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> (554:15) concludes that, either way, everyone agrees that there is no
            need to be strict before the age of two or three.

            The Bach, Taz, and others [assert] that children who understand what they learn may study sorrowful topics, and when [our Sages] say that it is
            forbidden to teach children, they mean [it is forbidden to teach them] their regular course of study. The Magen Avraham maintains that [an adult]
            should not teach them even sad topics, but one may tell them stories about the <em>churban</em>. See R. Karp’s [<em>Hilchot Chag BeChag</em>] 7:42
            and <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em> 8:20.
