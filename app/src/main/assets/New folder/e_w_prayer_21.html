        : Some Laws Concerning the Synagogue, Tzitzit, and Tefilin
    </h1>

        <a name="_Toc402175330">1. The Mitzva to Build a Synagogue</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Wherever ten Jews live, they have a mitzva to designate a place for
their prayers. It becomes a small sanctuary (<em>mikdash me</em>’        <em>at</em>) and is called a <em>beit knesset </em>(synagogue) (MT,
        Laws of Prayer 11:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is important to note that a synagogue is not just a place that
        facilitates prayer with a <em>minyan</em>; rather, it has independent
        value as a place designated for <em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>, a place
        where the <em>Shekhina</em> dwells. It is a great mitzva to build a
        synagogue, as the Torah states: "They shall make Me a sanctuary and I
        will live among them" (Shemot 25:8). Although this verse primarily
        comes to teach us about the building of the Temple, an offshoot of that
mitzva is the mitzva to build a synagogue (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Collected Essays I</em>, ch. 1 n. 1). This is what
        the prophet Yeĥezkel meant by "I have been for them a small sanctuary"
        (Yeĥezkel 11:16), as R. Yitzĥak interpreted, "These are the synagogues
        and <em>batei midrash </em>(study halls)" (<em>Megilla</em> 29a).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Especially after the destruction of our Temple and our exile from our
        land - and the exile of the <em>Shekhina </em>along with us - as a
        result of which we are unable to ascend and appear before the Lord, our
        God, the synagogues and study halls serve as places in which we can
        preserve the memory of the <em>Shekhina</em>’s manifestation at the
        Temple. Likewise, the prayers recited in the synagogue were instituted
        to correspond to the sacrificial offerings brought at the Temple.
        Hence, synagogues are constructed for two purposes: to facilitate
        organized prayer, and to serve as a miniature Temple, a commemoration
and extension of the Temple’s sanctity (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Collected Essays I</em>, ch. 6 concerning the laws
        of the synagogue; here we outline the laws that pertain to women).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Since the idea of the synagogue is so important, all members of the
        community must participate in the funding of its construction. If there
        are Jews who are not interested in participating in payments for
        building the synagogue, the leaders of the community may compel them to
        contribute its funding (SA 150:1, which states that it was customary to
        divide the payment according to wealth, though some divided the burden
        on a per capita basis).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It seems to me that the mitzva to build a synagogue applies to women as
        well, and it is good that she share in the payments for its
        construction. Even though women need not pray in the synagogue, they
        are nevertheless considered members of the community, and thus the
        mitzva to build a "small sanctuary" for the community applies to them
        as well. Additionally, it is worth noting that the Israelite women
        donated their jewelry to the <em>Mishkan</em>. Furthermore, women do
        come to pray in the synagogue sometimes; as we learned (above, 20:2),
        there is merit and value in a woman praying in a synagogue.
        Nonetheless, if a woman does not want to help financially support the
        building of the synagogue, it seems that she cannot be compelled to do
        so, since she is not obligated to pray in it.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175331">2. Choosing a Synagogue</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is a mitzva to designate a fixed place for prayer. It is even a
        mitzva for a woman who only comes to the synagogue on Shabbat and
        festivals to choose a regular synagogue. If possible, she should have a
        fixed place in the synagogue (see<em> Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
        3:2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        When one has several synagogues to choose from, she should choose one
in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Sages. A<em>beit midrash</em> (study hall) is holier than a synagogue (SA        <em> </em>90:18). Similarly, a synagogue that offers more Torah classes
        is considered preferable to one with fewer classes. In addition, it is
        better to join the congregation that places greater emphasis on Torah
        study.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If there are two synagogues which offer an equal number of Torah
        classes, the one with a greater number of congregants is preferable,
        for "<em>Be-rov am hadrat Melekh</em>" ("In a multitude of people is a
King’s glory"; MB 90:55). However, if it is difficult to hear the        <em>ĥazan</em> clearly in the larger synagogue, it is better to choose
        a synagogue in which one can properly hear the <em>ĥazan</em> (MB
        90:20). Therefore, as a general rule, it is best that synagogues be as
        big as possible, for this increases God’s glory. Still, there is a
        limit; more than a few hundred congregants makes it impossible to hear
        the <em>ĥazan</em> clearly.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If in one synagogue people regularly chatter during prayer and in
        another they do not, one should opt for the synagogue that shows more
respect for prayer, for he will be able to concentrate better there (        <em>Sefer Ĥasidim</em> §770).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Most importantly, the essence of prayer is<em> kavana</em>. Therefore,
        above all other rules established by the Sages, the place in which one
        personally concentrates better is the appropriate place to choose (see
        Radbaz 3:472).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Similarly, one should preferably pick a synagogue that uses the
        liturgical rite of her ancestors. However, if she knows for certain
        that she will have more <em>kavana </em>in a different synagogue, she
        should prefer that synagogue<em> </em>(see below, 24:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If a man prefers one synagogue and his wife prefers another, and each
        synagogue prays at a different time, the wife should follow her
        husband, for he is more regularly in the synagogue, since he is
        commanded to pray there. Moreover, in all matters concerning customs
        and <em>halakhot</em>, the wife follows her husband, as explained below
        (24:4).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        With every step a woman takes in her walk to the synagogue, she is
        rewarded. Therefore, even if the preferred synagogue is farther away
        from her house, she should not be deterred by the effort of walking,
        for she is credited for each step. This matter was in fact taught to us
        by a woman, as we have learned (above, 20:2; <em>Sota</em> 22a).
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175332">3. The Sanctity of the Synagogue</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is a mitzva to act with reverence in a synagogue, for the Torah
        says: "Revere My temple" (Vayikra 19:30), and the sanctity of the
        synagogue is a reflection of the sanctity of the Temple.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Whoever uses the synagogue for non-holy everyday purposes dishonors its
        holiness, since the synagogue was designated solely for sacred matters:
        Torah, prayer, and strengthening other <em>mitzvot</em>. Therefore, one
        should not discuss business and finances there, and certainly one
        should not joke or gossip there. However, it is permitted to hold
        assemblies for the sake of a mitzva, such as to collect charity for the
        poor or to raise funds for <em>yeshivot</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is a mitzva to honor the synagogue and maintain its cleanliness at
        all times. One who has mud on his shoes must remove it before entering
        the synagogue (SA 151:6-9).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One must not enter a synagogue unless it is for Torah or prayer. Even
        when it is raining outside, one may not take shelter in a synagogue.
        Likewise, one may not enter a synagogue in the summer to take refuge
        from the heat. However, if one intends to learn or pray in the
        synagogue while taking shelter, she may enter.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who must enter the synagogue to get his friend’s attention
        regarding an urgent matter may do so; however, before doing so, he
        should sit a bit and recite a verse, so as not to enter solely for
        personal needs (<em>Megilla</em> 28a; SA 151:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
In a synagogue that does not normally accommodate        <em>se’udot mitzva </em>(festive meals celebrating the fulfillment of a
        mitzva), it is preferable <em>le-khatĥila</em> to follow the stringent
opinion of <em>Magen Avraham</em> and not hold large<em>se’udot mitzva </em>at which wine is served, like those of a<em>brit mila</em>, <em>pidyon ha-ben</em>, bar-mitzva, or        <em>sheva berakhot</em>. However, serving light refreshments there at
        the celebration of a joyous occasion, such as a <em>siyum </em>
        (celebration of the completion of a talmudic tractate) and the like, is
        permissible. If it was customary to hold <em>se’udot mitzva </em>in the
        synagogue from its inception, then all agree that it is permissible to
        do so. This, of course, is all on condition that the congregants are
        extremely careful to preserve the sanctity of the synagogue, that they
        refrain from all idle talk and frivolity, and that they make certain
        not to become intoxicated. They must also ensure that women and men do
        not mingle in the synagogue. Those who wish to follow the lenient
        position may conduct <em>se’udot mitzva </em>even in a synagogue that
did not initially host such events, for that is the opinion of many        <em>poskim</em> (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Collected Essays I</em>, 6:8;
        for further study, read that entire chapter).

            4. One May Not Bring to Synagogue Children Who Are Likely to
            Disrupt
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is forbidden for one praying to seat a baby in front of her, as
        there is concern that the baby will disturb her <em>kavana</em> (MB
        96:4). Certainly during prayer times one may not bring babies and small
        children who do not know how to pray, since they are likely to distract
        the people praying.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one brings a child to prayer services and the child begins to
        disrupt the congregation’s prayers, he must take the child out of the
        synagogue, even if it means he must interrupt his <em>Amida</em>, and
        continue praying outside. This applies to women in the women’s section
        as well (see above, 14:2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Although there is a pious custom to bring babies to the synagogue so
        that they can absorb its holy atmosphere, the custom applies
        specifically to times when prayer services are not being held. In order
        to emphasize the importance of this matter, I will cite <em>Shlah</em>,
        which states in the name of <em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em>:
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Children’s chatter in synagogue is a severe prohibition. Nowadays young
        children come to the synagogue to bring punishment upon those who bring
        them there, for they come to desecrate the sanctity of our God’s house
        and to laugh in it as they do in city streets. They get up to play with
        one another; this one plays with that one and that one hits the other.
        One rejoices, another cries. One talks, another shouts. One runs here,
        the other, there. One relieves himself in the synagogue and everyone
        screams, ‘Water, water!’ Another one is given a book by his father,
        which he throws on the floor or tears it into twelve pieces.
Ultimately, the noise of their shenanigans destroys the        <em>kavana </em>of the worshippers and causes the desecration of God’s
        name. One who brings children to synagogue in this way should not
        expect reward, but punishment. The worst thing is that these children
        will be raised on this bad custom and foreign habit. As they grow
        older, they will increase their contempt for the synagogue and its
        sanctity and they will show no respect for the Torah, since once one
        becomes habituated to a sin, it becomes permitted to him, and even as
        he ages, he will not abandon it. In conclusion, it is proper for one
        not to bring very small children to synagogue, because he will [only]
        lose from it and not gain. However, when the child reaches the age of
        education, on the contrary; the father should bring the child to
        synagogue, teach him to sit in awe and reverence, not let him move from
his seat, and encourage him to answer "amen" and respond to<em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedusha</em> (<em>Shlah</em>,        <em>Masekhet Tamid Ner Mitzva</em>, brought by MB 98:3).

        <a name="_Toc402175334">5. Women and <em>Tzitzit</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>, a time-bound
positive mitzva that applies only during the day, not at night (        <em>Menaĥot </em>43a; SA 17:2; above, 2:7). Women who want to wrap
        themselves in a <em>talit</em> may do so privately. According to
        Ashkenazic practice, they would recite a <em>berakha</em>, and
        according to Sephardic practice, they would not.

        <a name="_Toc402175335">6. Women and <em>Tefilin</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from the mitzva of <em>tefilin</em>, as it is a
        time-bound positive mitzva that applies only on weekdays, not on
        Shabbat or festivals, when it is forbidden (above, 2:7).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
When it comes to other time-bound positive <em>mitzvot</em>, like        <em>lulav </em>and <em>shofar</em>, many women indeed fulfill them,
        since the law is that women are credited with the mitzva if they
        voluntarily fulfill them despite their exemption. Nevertheless, when it
        comes to <em>tefilin</em>, the common practice is that they do not wear
        them. The reason for this is that Jewish custom is very concerned for
        the honor of the <em>tefilin</em>. Even though technically men should
        wear <em>tefilin </em>all day, they only wear them in the morning, and
        only to fulfill their obligation, because there is concern that they
        will have lapses in concentration while wearing <em>tefilin</em> (which
        is forbidden) and thereby disrespect the <em>tefilin</em>. Similarly,
        women, who are not obligated to wear <em>tefilin</em> at all, should
        not put themselves in a situation that would raise concerns for
        disrespecting the <em>tefilin</em>. For this reason, the custom is that
        women do not put on <em>tefilin</em> (MA, AHS).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Therefore, a woman who wants to elevate herself through        <em>mitzvot</em> and asks whether she should wear <em>tefilin </em>
        should be instructed not to do so. If she nevertheless yearns to wear
        them in private, even though numerous authorities wrote that this is
        objectionable, one should not object, because there are opinions upon
        which she may rely. In general, whenever a practice has an authority on
        which to rely, one should not object to it.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
There are women who are not meticulous about the laws of        <em>tzni’ut</em> and many other <em>mitzvot</em>, but they wish to
        boast by wearing <em>talit </em>and <em>tefilin</em>. One should object
        to their agenda of turning the Torah and <em>mitzvot</em> into a site
        of social conflicts, as <em>mitzvot</em> should be performed for God’s
        sake, not as a tool to advance interests of one sort or another.

The law follows R. Shimon, who maintains that the mitzva of            <em>tzitzit</em> is time-bound and that women are therefore exempt
            (<em>Menaĥot </em>43a; Rif and Rosh <em>ad loc</em>.). Simply
            understood, however, if women wish to fulfill this mitzva they may,
            as is the case with other time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>. The only
            question is whether or not they would recite a <em>berakha</em>.
            Rambam (MT, Laws of <em>Tzitzit</em> 3:9) states: "Women and slaves
who wish to wrap themselves in <em>tzitzit</em> do so without a            <em>berakha</em>." So states <em>Sefer Ha-ĥinukh</em> §386. In
            contrast, Rabbeinu Tam and Ran maintain that women who wish to wrap
            themselves in <em>tzitzit</em> may recite the <em>berakha</em>.
They similarly disagree about whether women may recite a<em>berakha </em>on blowing the <em>shofar</em> or taking the            <em>lulav</em>. The practice of most Sephardic women is not to
            recite the <em>berakha</em>, while the practice of Ashkenazic women
            is to recite the <em>berakha</em>, as clarified in SA 589:6 (see
            above, 2:8).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            However, Maharil (<em>New Responsa </em>§7) says that women should
            not wrap themselves in a <em>talit</em>, mentioning several
            reasons, such as that we are concerned about forbidden fabric
            mixtures (<em>sha’atnez</em>), carrying on Shabbat, presumptuous
customs, and arrogance. He also mentions an esoteric reason. In            <em>Minhagei Maharil </em>(<em>Tzitzit </em>4), he writes that
            there were women who wrapped themselves in <em>tzitzit</em>,
            including the wife of Mahari Brin. Even though he was not pleased
            with this practice, he did not object. See also <em>Agur</em>, Laws
of <em>Tzitzit</em> 27, which mentions this practice.            <em>Targum Yonatan </em>of Devarim 22:5 implies that it is
            forbidden for women to wear <em>tzitzit</em> because it is
            forbidden for women to wear men’s clothes. However, none of the
            Rishonim who dealt with the issue mentioned this concern, even
though some Aĥaronim (including <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 1,            <em>Lekh Lekha </em>13) did mention it.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            SA 17:1 rules:
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Women and slaves are exempt, because it is a time-bound positive
            mitzva. Rema: Nevertheless, if they wish to wrap themselves in it
            and recite the <em>berakha</em>, they may do so, just like other
            time-bound positive <em>mitzvot </em>(<em>Tosafot</em>, Rosh, and
            Ran on the second chapter of <em>Rosh Hashana</em> and the first
            chapter of <em>Kiddushin</em>). Yet it appears arrogant, and
            therefore they should not wear <em>tzitzit</em> since it is not an
            obligation that devolves upon the individual (<em>Agur </em>§27),
            that is, one is not required to purchase a garment in order to
            become obligated in <em>tzitzit</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Thus, there is no concern for any halakhic violation, whether out
            of concern for <em>sha’atnez</em> or wearing men’s clothing. Rema
            wrote that women should not wrap themselves in <em>tzitzit</em>
            only because it appears arrogant.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            R. Moshe Feinstein addresses this issue thoroughly and writes that
            if a woman’s purpose in wrapping herself in <em>tzitzit</em> is for
            God’s sake, she may do so and it is a credit to her. She should use
            a garment that looks different from a man’s <em>talit</em> (such as
            by using other colors). According to Ashkenazic custom, she may
            recite the <em>berakha</em>. However, if she wishes to wrap herself
            in <em>tzitzit</em> because of external influence, and her purpose
            is to fight for the cause of feminism, and she wishes to join the
            fray out of resentment and in order to change the laws of the
            Torah, it constitutes a denial of the Torah, and she forfeits her
            share in the next world (<em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 4:49).

Therefore, in my opinion, a woman who wants to wrap herself in            <em>tzitzit</em> for God’s sake may do so in private. There is no
            concern for arrogance, and it is not an expression of resentment
            against <em>halakha</em> and the tradition. If many women do so for
God’s sake and in private, then over time even if they wear            <em>tzitzit</em> in non-private setting it will not be considered
            arrogance or an offense against the traditions of the Torah.
            Nevertheless, in my opinion, even today one should not object to a
            woman whose intentions are for God’s sake and who wraps herself
            publicly in <em>tzitzit</em>, for she has authorities upon whom to
            rely. However, one should object to women who are not meticulous
about many <em>mitzvot</em> but who specifically wear a            <em>talit</em> publicly in order to express their opposition to
            halakhic tradition.

            The <em>mishna </em>on <em>Berakhot </em>20a states that women are
            exempt from <em>tefilin</em> but does not clarify whether women who
            want to wear <em>tefilin</em> may do so just as they may perform
other positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> like <em>lulav </em>and            <em>shofar</em>. <em>Eruvin </em>96a cites a <em>beraita</em> that
states that Michal, the daughter of King Shaul, wore<em>tefilin</em> and that the Sages did not object.<em>Tosafot </em>(<em>ad loc.</em>) state in the name of<em>Pesikta</em> that the Sages indeed objected. Similarly,            <em>y. Berakhot </em>2:3 first cites an anonymous opinion that the
            Sages did not object and then cites R. Ĥizkiya to the effect that
            the Sages did, in fact, object. <em>Tosafot </em>state that
            according to the opinion that the Sages objected even though they
did not object to women performing other time-bound positive            <em>mitzvot</em>, it is because "<em>tefilin</em> require a clean
            body, and women are not zealously careful." (It seems that the
            concern is that they may not wear <em>tefilin</em> while
            menstruating - see Rema 88:1 - and since they do not normally study
            laws that do not pertain to their obligations, they will not be
            careful about this. Perhaps there is also concern that they will
handle a soiled diaper or another filthy household item.)            <em>Kol Bo </em>also states in the name of Maharam that one should
            object to women who wish to wear <em>tefilin</em> because "they do
            not know how to keep themselves clean." <em>Beit Yosef </em>cites
this, and SA 38:3 rules: "Women and slaves are exempt from            <em>tefilin</em> as it is a time-bound positive mitzva. Rema: If
women wish to be stringent upon themselves, we object (            <em>Kol Bo</em>)."

MA explains that if women had been obligated by the Torah to wear            <em>tefilin</em>, the rationale that they are not careful about
            cleanliness would not exempt them from the mitzva. However, since
            they are exempt and there is a concern about cleanliness, their
            wearing <em>tefilin</em> is objectionable. Along these lines, AHS
            states that really men have the same problem; <em>tefilin </em>
require a clean body. However, since men are obligated, they wear            <em>tefilin</em> for <em>Shema</em> and prayers while being as
            careful as possible. Women, though, are exempt, and should not
            subject themselves to this serious concern. For them, the time of
            prayer and reciting <em>Shema</em> are the equivalent of the rest
of the day for men. We therefore do not allow them to wear            <em>tefilin</em>. Even though Michal wore <em>tefilin</em> and the
            Sages did not object, this case is not instructive. Presumably,
            they knew that she was completely righteous and knew how to take
            the proper precautions. Similarly, <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>38:9
            states in the name of <em>Birkei Yosef </em>and other Aĥaronim that
            one should object to women wearing <em>tefilin</em> and cites
            esoteric reasons for this as well.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Yet there are Rishonim who say that one should not object. Indeed,<em>Orĥot Ĥayim</em> challenges Maharam’s strict ruling (cited in            <em>Kol Bo</em>) based on the opinion that the Sages did not object
to Michal wearing <em>tefilin</em>. This is cited in            <em>Beit Yosef</em>, which answers that <em>Kol Bo </em>relied on
the view that the Sages indeed object to Michal.            <em>Olat Tamid </em>(an early commentary on <em>Shulĥan Arukh</em>)
38:3 rejects Maharam’s view: if the prohibition on women wearing<em>tefilin</em> is based on cleanliness, why does            <em>Berakhot </em>20a state that they are exempt because it is a
            time-bound positive mitzva? Moreover, Michal wore <em>tefilin</em>
            and the Sages did not object. Therefore, <em>Olat Tamid </em>
            concludes: "We do not object to an old woman who we know is capable
            of guarding herself, and it is sort of case that they are
            discussing there [ in reference to Michal]." It is also said of
            several righteous women from early and later generations -
including the wife of R. Ĥayim ibn Atar - that they wore            <em>tefilin</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
The practical ruling is that a woman should not wear<em>tefilin</em>, and many authorities - including Rema,            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>, MB, and many others - state that objections
            should be raised against women who wish to wear <em>tefilin</em>.
            Nevertheless, a woman who wishes to wear <em>tefilin</em> has
authorities to rely upon - <em>Orĥot Ĥayim </em>and            <em>Olat Tamid</em> - and AHS also concludes that one should not
            object to one who is renowned as a righteous woman. Therefore, in
            practice, one should not object to this practice. However, a woman
            who wear <em>tefilin</em> should take care not to wear them while
            menstruating (though she may wear <em>tefilin</em> while counting
            her clean days) and should make sure to wear them in private, so
            that it is clear that she is wearing them for God’s sake and so
            that she does not advertise when she is menstruating.
