        <a name="_Toc402175159">1. Men and Women - Mutually Complementary</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As a rule, there is equality between the sexes. Men and women are all
        created in the divine image, and the uniqueness of the Jewish people
        inheres in Jewish women and men alike. The Torah was given to all
        Israel, men and women alike (see below, 7:1). The Sages derive from the
        verse "These are the laws that you must set before them" (Shemot 21:1)
        that "The Torah equated woman to man concerning all the laws in the
        Torah" (<em>Kiddushin</em> 35a).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Nonetheless, it is impossible to ignore the specific differences
        between men and women, whether innate physical and emotional
        differences or halakhic differences like those regarding positive
        time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>. These dissimilarities enable man and woman
        to complement each other.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In order to unveil the divine ideal in this world, revelation must
        occur through two complementary facets. Every individual creature is
        limited, and therefore cannot grasp divine perfection, but the people
        of Israel as a collective allows divine perfection to be manifest in
        the world. This indicates the tremendous importance of a unified
        Israel, because only the Jewish people, in all its components, can
        receive the Torah and with it rectify the world. Just as there is a
        difference between souls, so do the words of the Torah have multiple
        meanings, as it is written: "God said one thing from which I have heard
        two" (Tehilim 62:12) and: "Indeed, My word is like fire, like a hammer
        shattering rock" (Yirmiyahu 23:29). The Sages extrapolate, "Just as
        this hammer fragments into sparks, so too each and every statement that
came from God’s mouth refracts into seventy languages" (        <em>Shabbat</em> 88b). "Just as this hammer is divided into many
fragments, so one verse of scripture generates many meanings (        <em>Sanhedrin</em> 34a). Likewise, it is said about the disagreements
        between Beit Hillel and Beit Shamai, and all other rabbinic disputes,
        "These and those are the words of the living God" (<em>Eruvin</em>
        13b).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The most significant human reciprocal completion is the one between
        male and female, for with it human beings can reveal the divine image
        within them and achieve perfection. Not only concerning humanity, but
        in all of creation, from the sublime realms down to this earth, there
        is a division into male and female; neither sex can exist and endure
        independently, without the completion of the other. This fundamental
        principle is clarified at length in the wisdom of the Kabbala. That is
        what R. Elazar meant when he said: "Every man without a woman is not a
        [complete] person, as it is written: ‘Male and female He created them,
and He blessed them and called them man’ (Bereishit 5:2)" (        <em>Yevamot</em> 63a). Likewise, the Sages teach us: "Every man without
        a woman is inundated by unhappiness, without blessing, without
        goodness…without Torah, without fortification" (<em>Yevamot</em> 62b).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Just as the dissimilarity between men and women enables them to marry
        and have children, so too the spiritual and emotional difference
        between them allows them to unite so that they may complete and enrich
        one another spiritually.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Based on this, it is possible to grasp to some extent the basic reason
        for the halakhic differences between the <em>mitzvot</em> given to men
        and those given to women.

            2. Why Women Are Exempt from Positive Time-Bound <em>Mitzvot</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The simple and conventional reason why women are exempt from positive
        time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> is so that they can fulfill their destiny
        of building the family home. An enormous responsibility is placed upon
        women: to create and sustain the family, upon which our personal and
        national future is founded. This responsibility stems from their innate
        constitution as child-bearers and nursing mothers, as well as from
        their feminine and maternal character, which possesses unique qualities
        suitable for building and nurturing a family. The responsibility of
        managing the house and raising and educating the children often demands
        a devotion that extends to all hours of the day and night. Were women
to be given the responsibility of fulfilling the positive time-bound        <em>mitzvot</em>, which require one to cease all regular activity, they
would be unable to tend to their family's needs properly (based on        <em>Abudraham</em> and <em>Sefer</em> <em>Ĥasidim</em> §1011).<em></em>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        This view can also explain why women are exempt from the mitzva of
        Torah study. Torah study demands a great deal of dedication, both in
        adolescence, when acquiring the tools for Torah study, and subsequently
        throughout one’s entire life, when devoting hours every day to Torah
        study. If women were to be commanded to study Torah, they would not be
        able to devote themselves to building a family. Although women
        undoubtedly must learn Torah in order to live by its guidance, they are
        not obligated to study Torah for the sake of inquiry, theoretical
        profundity, and comprehensive knowledge. Thus, women are relieved of
        the constant pressure that accompanies men, who are commanded to commit
        themselves to continuous advancement in their knowledge of Torah.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        This illustrates the cardinal value of family. In order to foster the
        family, the Torah exempted women from the mitzva of Torah study and the
        positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It must be added that the very law that women are exempt from the
        mitzva of Torah study and time-bound positive <em>mitzvot</em> suggests
        that women, by nature, have less of a need for those <em>mitzvot</em>
        and that they can achieve personal completion without them (as will be
        explained below in section 5; see also <em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>, Shmuel
        §78). Based on this, we can learn that even a woman who does not bear
        the burden of family is exempt from these <em>mitzvot</em>.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175161">3. Intellect and Emotion</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        My teacher, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook, regularly emphasized the principle that
        men and women are equal. However, after positing that key precept, he
        would occasionally dwell on the differences between man and woman: "The
        element of intellect is more discernible in men. By contrast, human
        emotion is more prominent in women" (<em>Siĥot Ha-Ritzya</em>, Bamidbar
        p. 413). Of course, men also have feelings and women are also
        intelligent, but in general men incline more toward the intellect and
        women toward emotion. This approach has recently been reinforced by
        various research studies on the brain and mind, from which it emerges
        that there are two types of intelligence, intellectual (IQ) and
        emotional (EQ).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As a result of this distinction, in certain areas the man is more
        active, whereas the woman is more passive. After the intellect arrives
        at conclusions, it produces and constructs, whereas emotion is
        characterized by perceiving impressions from surrounding events; it
        does not initiate them, rather is impacted by them. Thus, we find that
        the Torah sages of earlier generations described men as being more
        inclined to influence and women as being more apt to receive.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        These two complementary traits allow us to connect wholly to the Divine
        ideal, grow stronger in faith, live a Torah existence, and rectify the
        world under the Almighty’s sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Through the analytical and discerning intellect, we establish the
        principles with which we govern our lives, and via spontaneous, raw
        emotion we are able to better absorb the faith and vitality of the
        Torah.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In the following paragraphs I will attempt to further refine this
        concept based on the words of Rav Kook and his son, R. Zvi Yehuda.

        <a name="_Toc402175162">4. The Virtue of Men and Intellect</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Intelligence is what separates human beings from all other living
        creatures. It enables man to investigate, reach conclusions, plan
        action, and make significant changes in the world. It allows people to
        cooperate, organize themselves as a community, and achieve tremendous
        accomplishments. Thus, it governs humanity and society. With it, the
        core principles and fundamental beliefs upon which human life rests are
        established. From this perspective, intelligence is collective.
        Emotion, however, is individual, consistent with one's personal
        impressions and not in keeping with what general rules and principles
        dictate. Intellect allots every notion an established universal
        definition, and when those ideas are perceived emotionally, they indeed
        refract into innumerable hues, according to each person’s individual
        character. Even within the same person, ideas are perceived in varying
        ways, based on shifting moods.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Based on this, we can understand the virtue of the mitzva of Torah
        study, which is performed by the intellect. Through meticulous and
        methodical study, an intellectual Torah worldview, with which it is
        possible to lead the world and rectify it, takes shape. This is also
        the purpose of the positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>: they champion,
        in a focused manner, important ideas that guide the people of Israel
        with their light. The recitation of <em>Shema</em>, for example,
        reminds us of the fundamentals of Torah and faith; <em>tzitzit</em>
        remind us of all the <em>mitzvot</em> and make us wary of the evil
        inclination; thus, all the time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> highlight Torah
        values that must govern our lives.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Within this framework, we can also understand why leadership tends to
        be placed in the hands of men - kings, rabbinical court judges, judges,
        enforcers, and military men. As the Sages<em> </em>say: "There is no
        more kosher (upright) a woman among women, than a woman who does the
will of her husband" (<em>Eliya Rabba</em> §10;        <em>Yalkut Shimoni, </em>Melakhim 42).
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175163">5. The Superiority of Women and Emotion</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        By contrast, emotion, which receives and is impressed upon, is able to
        grasp faith more naturally and spontaneously. From this standpoint,
        women are closer to the Divine ideal and are more universal. It is
        through the manifestation of the divine universal, which sustains the
        world, that all of the fundamental parameters that the intellect
        discerns and delineates is drawn. This virtue of women is embedded in
        the material from which she was created. Whereas man was created from
        dust, woman was created from a more refined substance - man’s rib.
        Since the substance from which the woman was created is of higher
        quality, she is more capable of naturally perceiving the divine ideal.
        Feminine intuition is closer to faith, and therefore even without the
        intervention of intellectual Torah analysis, and without the mediation
        of specific time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, women can connect profoundly
        to the Torah and its purpose. In contrast, men require the study of
        Torah and the time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> in order to firmly establish
        their connection to faith and Torah.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Likewise, we find that in all the great events which occurred to the
        Jewish people, the great virtue of women was manifested, for they
        preceded men in choosing the path of faith. It seems, then, that
        masculine intellectual analysis is sufficient under normal
        circumstances; however, where additional spirituality and more faith
        are required, it is specifically the feminine attributes which are
        necessary. "R. Akiva preached, ‘In the merit of righteous women, the
        people of Israel left Egypt’" (<em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>,<em> </em>
        Tehilim 795, and see Rashi on<em> </em>Shemot 38:8). At the giving of
        the Torah on Mount Sinai, the women were addressed first (Rashi on
        Shemot 19:3, based on a <em>midrash</em>). Similarly, we learn how to
        honor the Torah from women (below, 7:1). Men even learn Torah in the
        merit of women’s profound insight (see <em>Berakhot</em> 17a and below,
        7:1). Additionally, women did not participate in the sin of the Golden
Calf (<em>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</em> §45) or the sin of the Spies (        <em>Tanĥuma Pinĥas</em> §7). Concerning the future, the Sages say
"Generations are only redeemed in the merit of its righteous women" (        <em>Midrash Zuta</em>, Ruth 4:11).
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Women's%20Prayer%20MASTER%20Corrected.docx#_ftn2"

            [2]
        </a>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The virtue of woman also finds expression in the holy language of
Hebrew. Many universal ideas are expressed in the feminine form:<em>ĥadashot</em> (news), <em>nifla'ot</em> (wonders),        <em>netzurot</em> (secrets), and <em>nisgavot</em> (sublime ideas).
Also, <em>emuna</em> (faith), Torah, mitzva (commandment),<em>tefila</em> (prayer), <em>segula</em> (uniqueness),<em>Yahadut</em> (Judaism), <em>kehuna</em> (priesthood), and        <em>melukha</em> (royalty), are in the feminine form. As noted, this is
because the feminine nature is closer to divinity (        <em>Siĥot Ha-Ritzya</em>, Bereishit p. 77).
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Women's%20Prayer%20MASTER%20Corrected.docx#_ftn3"

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        This same trait that enables women to integrate and accept the divine
        idea also allows them to accept masculine principles and apply them to
        life. Men are more able to define the ideas, but women are better able
        to apply them in life. The conception of a fetus originates with the
        man, but it is the woman who actually develops it in her womb, gives
        birth to it, nurses it, and raises it. Therefore, women constitute the
        essence of the home and it is they who merit managing the grand ideal
        of constructing the family.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175164">6. A Hierarchy of Virtues</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        First there must be an acknowledgment of the value of the Torah and its
        study and an awareness of the virtue of the time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>
        , which illuminate every-day life. It is man’s job to be responsible
for the preservation of the universal values expressed through these        <em>mitzvot</em>, and to declare them publicly at the established
        times, as the Torah commands. By recognizing the value of the male
        role, women can transmit the light within these <em>mitzvot</em> to all
        strata of life.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        At first glance, it seems that the status of men is higher than that of
        women; men rule and influence while women receive and are acted upon.
        However, in the longer term, feminine influence becomes stronger. The
Sages teach (<em>Bereishit Rabba</em> 17:7), "There is a tale of a        <em>ĥasid</em> (pious man) who was married to a certain <em>ĥasida</em>
        (righteous woman), and they did not have any children together. They
        said: ‘We are not helping God at all.’ So they got divorced. The man
        went and married an evil woman who, in turn, made him evil. The woman
        went and married an evil man and she made him righteous. We thus learn
        that everything stems from the woman."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Man’s human aspects are more pronounced; intellect is indeed the
        pinnacle of humanity. Woman’s ability to receive divinity is more
        pronounced. Therefore, even though it is the husband who is commanded
        to learn Torah and establish the values, the general attitude toward
        those values is more affected by woman; her righteousness or wickedness
        radiates onto her husband. In the long term, the broader approach to
        faith is more influential. Therefore, if the woman is righteous and she
        and her husband have a good relationship, it follows that her husband
        will also eventually become a righteous person, and if she is evil, her
        husband will presumably also be wicked.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There are allusions to this idea within the mystical tradition:
        Initially the man's advantage is more apparent, but in the future, the
        advantage of women will be more apparent, as alluded in the verse
        (Yirmiyahu 31:21), " For God has created something new on earth: A
        woman courts a man." In this world, our gaze is external, and therefore
        the advantages of man, the one who learns and leads, are greater than
        those of woman. However, in the future we will gain a more profound
        vision and then the virtue of faith and intuitive perception will be
        revealed, such that the status of men and women will become equal. In
        the World to Come, the virtue of faith and the Divine perception will
        be so evident that the status of woman will be greater than that of
        man. Even then, there will be a place and a need for learning as well
        as for rigorous definitions, yet the feminine emotional aspect will
        take primacy.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It can be said that after Adam's original sin and the introduction of
        the evil inclination into human beings, it is more difficult to rely
        upon one’s intuition and natural emotions; hence, the primary struggle
        with the evil inclination is guided by one's intellect, which must
        control and direct emotion. However, as the world becomes rectified and
        faith and morals become a common legacy, the concern that natural
        emotion will erupt in a misguided and destructive manner lessens. As a
        result, impediments to emotional expression will be removed, its merit
        revealed, and with it, the virtue of women.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        We should not say that the World to Come is so remote from us that it
        has no influence on our lives at all, because even today it is buried
        deeply inside of us. The external soul corresponds to this world, the
        internal spirit corresponds to the future, and the innermost soul
        corresponds to the World to Come. Therefore, even today, the deeper we
        delve, the more we find women’s influence. However, the arrangement is
        such that woman’s humility in accepting man’s virtue and influence
        allows her to express more and more of her own virtue.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is possible to expand upon this topic, but this is not the place. We
        shall only briefly allude to the fact that the relationship between the
        sun which radiates and the moon which receives resembles the
        male/female relationship. Initially, they were both equal, but as a
        result of the moon’s arrogance, it was diminished. However, in truth,
        at the heart of the matter, its virtue is great, for it receives the
        light here in this world. To a certain extent, this is also the
        relationship between the heavens and the earth; at first glance, the
        skies are more exalted, but upon second glance, the purpose of creation
        was for the earth and the final outcome was conceived at the outset.
        This is also the relationship between the tribe of Yehuda and the tribe
        of Yosef. On one hand, Yehuda reigned; however, the most cherished and
        beloved son was Yosef, who was beautiful like a woman, and who was
        capable of revealing all the highest ideals within this world, in
        beauty and splendor.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175165">7. Love and Partnership</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On its own, every attribute is deficient. The discerning, studying
        intellect is liable to lose the vitality that stems from its connection
        to the divine. Likewise, due to its constant involvement in principles
        and rules, it is liable to lose touch with real life. In contrast,
        emotional intuition, when it comes to organize life in the world, is
        likely to get carried away and err, straying from the precise law.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Consequently, the task of setting rules and principles was given to
        men, who are commanded to occupy themselves in Torah and to fulfill
        positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, thereby laying the foundations of
        Jewish life. Women, on the other hand, express the general connection
        to faith and the tangible life of Torah, by virtue of which men connect
        to natural faith and better comprehend the value of the analytic
        principles.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On the surface, it seems that the task of men is more important; on
        account of these virtues, they are worthy of the mitzva of Torah study
        as well as the positive time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, and consequently,
        men are given leadership and authority. After all, one who is occupied
        with Torah principles must lead and guide others. However, looking
        deeper, we see that the value of women is actually greater. Although it
        is true that men are more engaged with principles and leadership, the
        building of a family, which is the most significant element in life,
        was placed in the hands of women. Moreover, the purpose of creation is
        to receive divine illumination within actual life and to experience it
        with the utmost intensity. Women are more attuned to this.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Specifically because of women’s quality of humility, she is able to
        receive the divine and absorb the illumination that stems from Torah
        study and from positive time bound <em>mitzvot</em>. This, in turn,
        enables her to express her great virtues. It is thus no coincidence
        that man’s virtues are more noticeable, while women’s are internal and
        concealed. "The king’s daughter is all glorious within" (Psalms 45:14).
        This also allows us to understand the meaning of the <em>berakha </em>
        of <em>She’asani Ki-rtzono</em> (as explained below, 6:2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        When the uniqueness of each sex is blurred or subjected to struggle and
        hostility, man and woman are unable to make each other more productive.
        Young couples have difficulty building their families, and existing
        family structures deteriorate and collapse.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On the other hand, when we understand the value of each sex, thereby
        allowing for a greater connection and love, the divine Presence dwells
        with the couple (<em>Sota</em> 17a), faith and joy increase in the
        world, and the intellectual and emotional elements develop and
        integrate. The people of Israel, with all its families, thus continues
        to grow, speaking God’s praise in the world.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Based on what we have learned, it is possible to better comprehend the
        significance of women’s prayer. Two elements come into play in prayer,
        one personal and one collective. The personal is the individual’s
        appeal to the source of life, to her God, to petition Him for mercy.
        The collective element gives expression to the permanent connection
        between God and the Jewish people, thereby sanctifying His name in the
        world and drawing blessings down upon His creation. The collective
        element of prayer is the perpetuation of the sacrificial rites in the
        Temple, and therefore the prayers were instituted to correspond to the
        daily <em>Tamid</em> offerings.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Sometimes there is some tension between the personal and collective
        aspects of prayer. From the individual perspective, prayer should
        theoretically be poured out from the heart with no limitations, without
        any fixed formulas or set times, so that it can spontaneously and
        emotionally express one’s yearning and longing to be close to God. That
        is how people prayed during First Temple era. However, the Men of the
        Great Assembly, in their enactments, emphasized the collective element,
        for they understood that without a fixed prayer rite, most people would
        become stuck in their routines and would not recite even a personal
        prayer. Moreover, personal feelings are often flawed and deficient.
        However, when one prays with a community, his prayers are complemented
        and perfected by virtue of the collective. Therefore they instituted
        the recital of prayers at set times, corresponding to the bringing of
        the <em>Tamid </em>offering in the Temple. They established a fixed
        formula for prayer, including in it all the values important to the
        people of Israel as a whole. They composed the prayers in the plural
        and instituted communal prayer - in a synagogue with a <em>minyan</em>
        - for the essence of Israel’s greatness is that they can express
        sanctity publicly, thus revealing God’s name in the world and bringing
        it closer to perfection.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As a result of the emphasis on the collective and fixed aspects of
        prayer, the personal component, with its intense and fervent passion,
        is liable to be pushed aside. This is the meaning of R. Shimon’s
        warning: "Do not make your prayer fixed, but [make it] a plea for mercy
        and supplication before God"(<em>Avot</em> 2:13). Rabbi Eliezer
        similarly said: "If one renders his prayer fixed, his prayer is not
        supplication" (<em>Berakhot</em> 28b).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Nevertheless, the Sages emphasized the collective component in their
        enactment, thereby instituting the fundamentals of faith within life.
        From this standpoint, prayer is a continuation of the Temple service,
        and just as the <em>korbanot</em> expressed the connection that the
        Jewish people and the entire world have with God, so too the prayers
        give public expression to this connection in every Jewish community.
        Even in the Temple Mount precincts, there was a synagogue for prayer in
        the time of the Second Temple. Although this emphasis is likely to
        result in the sidelining of personal feeling, the general impact of
        fixed public prayer on the entire world as well as each individual is
        tremendous. Therefore, the Sages preferred to set a defined framework
        for prayer (see 1:8 above).

        <a name="_Toc402175167">9. Women’s Prayer</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In contradistinction to the aforementioned, in women’s prayer, the
        personal element is more pronounced. Because women are exempt from
time-bound positive <em>mitzvot</em>, they do not need to recite<em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, the <em>Shema </em>and the        <em>berakhot </em>associated with it, or the other passages that men
recite in their prayers. Although women must use the text of        <em>Shemoneh Esrei </em>instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly,
        since their prayer rite is shorter, there is less concern that routine
will erode their <em>kavana</em>. In practice, even with regard to        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, women may decide whether to recite it twice
        daily in accordance with the stringent view, or once daily in
        accordance with the lenient opinion (see above, 2:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Moreover, since a woman need not pray in a synagogue and with a<em>minyan</em>, she may pray when she feels she will be able have more        <em>kavana</em>. Likewise, the pace of her prayer is not dictated by
        that of the communal prayer. It thus emerges that the personal,
        petitionary element is more prominent in a woman's prayer. Furthermore,
        the Sages instituted that men who do not know how to pray may come to
        synagogue and fulfill their obligation by hearing the <em>ĥazan</em>'s
        repetition of the <em>Amida</em> (<em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>), whereas
women who do not know how to pray need not hear        <em>Ĥazarat Ha-shatz</em>. The simple explanation for this is that it
is impossible to burden women with this, but perhaps in women's prayer,        <em>kavana </em>is more prominent and halakhic details less so. Thus, a
        woman who does not know how to recite the fixed liturgy may pray in her
        own words as best as she can, for the essence of women's prayer is to
        ask God for mercy.

            It seems that from the standpoint of the human intellectual virtue,
            men are more universal, whereas from the standpoint of the
            perception of the divine idea and faith, as expressed via intuitive
            vitality, women are more universal. Therefore, women grasp
            momentous historical divine processes to a greater degree.

            Perhaps, therefore, when discussing the principle of Jewish
            tradition, it is said (Mishlei 1:8), "Do not forsake the Torah of
            your mother," for the primary building block of education is the
            construction of the natural universal connection with God and his
            Torah, a quality more prominent in women. In contrast, the father’s
            guidance centers on detailed and prescriptive guidelines, and since
            sometimes it is difficult for one to completely identify with those
            limiting and restricting teachings, it comes with an aspect of
reproof - "Listen, my son, to the rebuke of your father" (            <em>ibid</em>.).

            In recent generations, the greatest Ĥasidic leaders tried to find
ways to reintroduce long-neglected personal feelings and            <em>kavana</em> into prayer, even sacrificing halakhic details to
            this end. Some introduced melodies into prayer, which is not
            halachically problematic whatsoever. Others repeated words over and
            over until they felt that they had enough <em>kavana</em>, a
            practice which poses a halachic problem. Some would shout their
            prayers, which also goes against the Sages’ guidance. Some delayed
            the time of prayers until they felt that they were sufficiently
            prepared to concentrate properly; if in the interim the deadline
            for prayer passes, this goes completely against <em>halakha</em>.
            Still others would pray alone so as to arouse <em>kavana</em> (on
            the value of <em>minyan</em>, see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
            2:1,2, and 5). Consequently, opposition to their practices arose.
            However, they insisted that individual <em>kavana </em>is so
            important that they warrant ignoring halakhic details. In
            actuality, after a few generations, most Ĥasidim returned to
            observance of halakhic rules in accordance with Jewish tradition.

            According to Ramban, women must pray daily to request mercy on
            behalf of themselves. Some say, based on a different version of the
            Gemara, that Rambam agrees. However, the general, public element,
            corresponding to the <em>Tamid </em>offerings and the sanctity of
            the Temple (of which the synagogue is a miniature version) is more
            prominent in the Sages’ enactments for men. Additionally, men must
            recite the <em>Shema </em>and its <em>berakhot</em>. In contrast,
            for women, the first principle of prayer - praise, petition, and
            thanksgiving - remain. We also saw (2:4 above) that women who are
            preoccupied with raising their children are exempt from prayer, as
            they cannot have the proper <em>kavana</em>, though for men in the
            same situation, the <em>poskim</em> are not lenient. Again we find
that regarding women there is more of an emphasis on            <em>kavana</em> and the request for mercy, whereas concerning men,
            preservation of the framework for expression of the divine Presence
            in prayer is preserved.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            This is consistent with what we explained in n. 2, namely, that
            from an intellectual standpoint, women are more private, but from
            the aspect of accepting faith, she is more general. The institution
of prayer services with a <em>minyan</em> corresponding to the            <em>korbanot</em> offers greater expression to the intellectual
            aspect, imparting the fundamentals of faith in the world, to which
            men are more suited. In contrast, <em>kavana</em> is more prominent
            among women and expressed more in personal prayer. This is the
            mitzva of prayer for women, in which the voluntary element is more
            prominent. For this reason, many basic principles of prayer were
learned from the prayer of Ĥana. For further study see            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 2:2, 5 as well as below, ch. 15 n.
1, which notes that women are exempt from reciting the            <em>Tamid</em> passage because the obligation of women to pray
stems from the need to request mercy, not as a replacement of the<em>Tamid</em>. Mabit (<em>Beit Elokim</em>,            <em>Sha'ar He-yesodot </em>ch. 39) explains that until the
            destruction of the Temple, the divine Presence was revealed through
            the Temple service, and the individual's prayer was also heard.
            After the destruction of the First Temple, the Men of the Great
            Assembly instituted prayer with a <em>minyan</em> so that the
            divine Presence would dwell among them, thereby allowing their
            prayer to be accepted.
