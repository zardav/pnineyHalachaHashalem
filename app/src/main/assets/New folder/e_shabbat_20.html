    <h2>
        1. Rest for Animals
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as a Jew is commanded to rest on Shabbat, so too, he is commanded
        to allow his animals to rest. There are two commandments that address
        this issue, one positive (<em>aseh</em>), as the Torah states (Shemot
        23:12): "Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you
shall cease, so that your <strong>ox</strong> and your        <strong>donkey</strong> may rest, and the son of your maidservant and
        the stranger may be refreshed." And one negative (<em>lo ta’aseh</em>),
        as the Torah states (Shemot 20:10): "But the seventh day is a Shabbat
        of the Lord your God; you shall not do any <em>melakha</em> - you, your
son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your        <strong>beast</strong>, or the stranger who is within your
        settlements." The mitzva of allowing animals to rest is not one of the
        39 <em>melakhot</em> but a mitzva in its own right; its violation is
        not punishable by death or lashes (<em>Shabbat</em> 154a; MT 20:1-2).
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though the Torah in those verses mentions beasts, oxen, and
        donkeys, the prohibition applies to all animals, including birds and
        fish (MB 305:1). Therefore, one may not release carrier pigeons on
        Shabbat, and one may not use trained dolphins to pull a boat. The Torah
        specifies the ox and the donkey because they are the beasts of burden
        most commonly used for plowing and carrying heavy loads.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who causes an animal carrying a load to move from one place to
        another on Shabbat, whether by striking, pulling, or ordering it,
transgresses Torah law. This prohibition is referred to as        <em>Meĥamer</em>. Even if the animal belongs to a non-Jew or is
        ownerless, one may not cause it to walk with a burden. If one causes
his own animal to do so, then in addition to transgressing the        <em>lo ta’aseh</em><em> </em>against doing work, he has also violated
the <em>aseh</em><em> </em>of allowing animals to rest (SA 266:1-2; MB        <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 7-8). The latter commandment applies on Yom
        Kippur as well (there is disagreement about whether it applies on Yom
        Tov; see MB 246:19).
    </p>
    <p>
        A Jew may not rent his animal to a non-Jew who will use it to do work
        like plowing or carrying burdens in the public domain on Shabbat. If a
        Jew rents out an animal with the understanding that it will be returned
        before Shabbat, but it is not, he should declare the animal ownerless
        before Shabbat to avoid violating Torah law (SA 246:3). If a Jew and a
        non-Jew are co-owners of an animal, the Jew may not permit the non-Jew
        to work the animal on Shabbat. However, if when they first bought the
        animal they specified that the non-Jew would be the sole owner on
        Shabbat, while the Jew would be the sole owner on a different day of
        the week, then the non-Jew may work the animal on Shabbat, because on
        Shabbat it is his alone (SA 246:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        A Jew may allow a non-Jew to ride his horse or other animal on Shabbat,
in accordance with the principle that "a living being carries itself" (        <em>he-ĥai nosei et atzmo</em>). Therefore, the non-Jew who rides the
        animal is not considered a burden (nor are the clothes he wears, as
        they are secondary to his body). However, the Sages enacted that a Jew
        may not use an animal at all. He may not lean on it, place an object on
        it, or sit in a wagon hitched to it, even if a non-Jew is driving the
        wagon for his own purposes (SA 305:18). The reason for this enactment
        is to avoid burdening the animal on Shabbat (<em>y. Beitza</em> 5:2).
        Another reason is that while riding an animal, one may come to break
off a tree branch in order to goad the animal, thus transgressing        <em>Kotzer</em> (<em>Beitza</em> 36b).
    </p>
    <p>
A Jew may not take another Jew’s animal outside of <em>teĥum</em>        <em>Shabbat</em>. This <em>teĥum</em> is based on the <em>teĥum</em> of
        the animal’s owner (see below, 30:3). If the owner entrusted the animal
        to a shepherd, whether Jew or non-Jew, the <em>teĥum</em> is based on
        that of the shepherd (SA 397:3-5). The prohibition is only for the
        animal to leave the <em>teĥum</em> at the initiative of its owner; it
        is not prohibited for the animal to leave of its own volition or for a
        non-Jewish shepherd to take it outside the <em>teĥum</em> (Rema 305:23;
        MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 79).
    </p>
    <h2>
        2. Animals and Carrying
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, one must allow animals to rest on Shabbat. This
includes making sure that one’s animal does not enter a semipublic (        <em>karmelit</em>) or public domain with a burden on its back. However,
        not everything an animal carries is defined as a burden. Just as one
        may enter a different domain wearing his clothes because they are
        secondary to his body, so too a donkey suffering from the cold may be
        taken outside wearing a pack saddle that is meant to warm it. Other
        animals, though, which do not suffer from the cold, may not be taken
        outside with a saddle (SA 305:7). Similarly, a dog that is wrapped in
        an article of clothing may not be taken outside. Since it does not
        truly need this, the clothing is considered a burden. If one is not
        taking the dog outside, one may dress it, as there is no prohibition to
        carry in a private domain.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may take out an animal that is wearing a bandage to protect an
        injury or a sheep that is wearing a cover designed to keep its wool
        from getting dirty. This is on condition that they are tightly bound to
        the animal, with no possibility that they will fall off, thus ensuring
        that no one will end up carrying them in a semipublic or public domain
        (SA 305:6). One may not take out an animal with a muzzle that is meant
        to prevent the animal from grazing in other people’s fields. This is
        because the muzzle is not worn for the animal’s sake, but for the sake
        of the fields’ owners (SA 305:11).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not lead an animal with a bell around its neck, as doing so
        generates sound, and it is rabbinically prohibited to generate sound
        with an object specifically designed for this purpose, such as a
        musical instrument. However, if the bell is silenced and makes no
        sound, the animal may be led around in a private domain but not a
        public domain. If the animal were to be led around in a public domain,
it would seem like it was being taken to market for sale (        <em>Shabbat</em> 53a and 54b; MB 305:42-43). The bell itself is not
        considered a burden as it is secondary to the animal’s halter.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may take out a horse wearing a bridle or a donkey wearing a halter
        since these items are used to direct the animals and to prevent them
        from running away. However, a donkey may not be taken out wearing a
        bridle, as this would be an excessive precaution, far more than is
        necessary to ensure that the donkey will not run away. The general
        principle is that anything normally used to ensure that an animal will
        not run away is not considered a burden, but anything excessive is
        considered a burden (SA 305:1; MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 8).
    </p>
    <p>
        A dog may be allowed out in a public domain wearing its collar, because
        that is the normal way for it to go out since it allows one to restrain
        the dog if necessary by grabbing its collar or attaching a leash to it
        (SA 305:5; MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 12). The person holding the
        leash is not considered carrying the leash, since it is secondary to
the dog’s body. However, he must take care to grasp the leash within a        <em>tefaĥ</em> of its end. He also must make sure that the leash does
        not droop to within a <em>tefaĥ</em> of the ground at any point. If
        either of these things happens, it looks like he is carrying the leash.
        If the leash is too long, he may wrap it around the dog’s neck so it is
        less likely to droop (SA 305:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        A blind person may enter a public domain with a seeing-eye dog, even
        though he is holding the harness attached to the dog. Since the harness
        is always attached to the dog, it is secondary to its body, and there
        is no problem of carrying. (Although <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 31:17 is
stringent, it seems reasonable to permit, as explained in<em>Harĥavot</em>; this is also the position of<em>Mikveh Ha-mayim</em> 4:39; <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:27:49; and        <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 305:59.)
    </p>
    <p>
        A dog may be taken out into a public domain wearing dog tags connected
        to its collar or ear and on which is engraved the name of the dog’s
        owner. The tags make it clear that the dog has an owner, and thus
        people are more likely to leave it alone.

    <h2>
        3. Feeding Animals
    </h2>
    <p>
        An animal may be led to graze in a grassy area, and it does not
        constitute <em>Kotzer</em> since the animal is eating for its own sake.
        We are not commanded to make sure that animals keep Shabbat, only that
        they do not labor for our benefit (<em>Shabbat</em> 122:1; SA 324:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may provide food and water to animals in his possession that depend
        on him, like cows, chickens, and cats. Food and water may also be
        provided to animals belonging to another Jew. However, one may not feed
        or water self-sufficient animals like bees and doves. Even though
        feeding them is not a <em>melakha</em>, the Sages prohibited it because
        it is seen as requiring excessive effort (SA 324:11; BHL s.v.
        "ve-yonei").
    </p>
    <p>
        One may put food out for hungry animals like stray dogs and cats. As we
        know, God shows mercy to all His creatures, as it is written: "His
        mercy is upon all His works" (Tehilim 145:9). It is proper to emulate
        His ways (AHS 324:2-3; see MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 31).
    </p>
    <p>
        Animals are <em>muktzeh</em>. Therefore, they may not be picked up, nor
        may their limbs be lifted up. However, when it is necessary for their
        well-being (for example, in order to get them to their food), one may
take hold of them and move their limbs to prevent them from suffering (        <em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em>), as long as one does not lift them off
        the ground (SA 308:39-40; MB <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>. 151).
    </p>
    <p>
        If animals have difficulty eating unless the food is placed directly in
        their mouths, one may feed them in this way as long as he does not
        force-feed them. Force-feeding refers to shoving the food so far down
        their throats that they are unable to spit it up. This requires
        excessive effort (<em>Shabbat</em> 155b; SA 324:9-10).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may ask a non-Jew to feed geese that have been force-fed for so
        long that they are unable to eat otherwise and would suffer hunger and
        pain if they were not fed on Shabbat. In such a case, one may ask a
        non-Jew to feed them one time on Shabbat. If there is no non-Jew
        available, the <em>poskim</em> disagree whether a Jew may feed them to
        minimize their suffering (MB 324:27). It is better not to force-feed
        geese at all, as doing so causes them pain and entails multiple
        prohibitions (see BHL <em>ad</em> <em>loc</em>.; SSK 27:26).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may cut up food for animals if they would not be able to readily
        eat it otherwise. This includes cutting up pumpkins that are fed to
        animals and tough carcasses that are fed to dogs and that they have
        trouble eating. However, one may not cut up any food for them that they
        could eat by themselves. Even if cutting makes it easier for them to
        eat, it is excessive effort and thus forbidden on Shabbat (SA 324:3-8).
    </p>
    <h2>
        4. Milking on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Torah law forbids milking a cow or any other animal on Shabbat, as
doing so separates the milk from the cow’s body and constitutes<em>Mefarek </em>(separating something from its source), a        <em>tolada</em> of <em>Dash</em>. Just as one may not separate grain
from its husk, so too, one may not separate milk from its source (        <em>Shabbat</em> 95a).
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is that if a dairy cow, which produces great quantities of
        milk, is not milked on Shabbat, it suffers greatly. Therefore, the
        Sages permitted asking a non-Jew to milk a cow on Shabbat. Even though,
        generally speaking, it is rabbinically prohibited to ask a non-Jew to
        do <em>melakha</em> for us on Shabbat, here they suspended the
        prohibition in order to avoid <em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em>. It is true
        that this milk is <em>muktzeh</em> on Shabbat. However, after Shabbat a
        Jew may drink or sell it (SA 305:20).
    </p>
    <p>
        If there is no non-Jew available, a Jew may milk the cow, as long as
        the milk goes to waste. For example, it may be milked directly onto the
        ground, or into a bucket that contains an agent that will ruin the
        milk. This is because milking to make use of the milk is prohibited by
        Torah law, whereas milking for another reason, in which the milk goes
        to waste, is only rabbinically prohibited. A Torah prohibition may not
        be transgressed in order to prevent animals’ suffering, but the Sages
        suspended their own enactment.
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn2"

    </p>
    <p>
        Nowadays, dairy farming has been modernized, and milking is automated.
        A cup is placed on the teat and connected to a pump via a tube. If
        there is a non-Jew available, one may ask him to turn on the machine
        and place the cups on the cow on Shabbat, because otherwise the cows
        would suffer. If no non-Jew is available, common practice is for a Jew
        to use a timer or a delay mechanism that is set before Shabbat to turn
        on the machine. On Shabbat, before the machine turns on, the cups are
        attached to the cow’s teats, and then the machine turns on and
automatically pumps out the milk. Thus, the Jew has not performed any        <em>melakha</em> directly, for when he attached the cups, the machine
was not on. Even though placing the cups on the teats causes a        <em>melakha</em> to take place, this is not prohibited by Torah law.
        The Torah only forbids direct action, as it states: "You shall not do
        any <em>melakha</em>" (Shemot 20:10). The Sages forbade indirectly
        causing a <em>melakha</em> to be performed. Here, to prevent the cows
from becoming painfully engorged, the Sages permitted acting via        <em>grama</em>. After Shabbat, a Jew may benefit from this milk.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the cups must be attached to the teats while the machine is
        operating, then doing so in order to save the milk violates Torah law.
        Therefore, the milk should spill directly onto the ground, making the
action rabbinically prohibited and thus permissible to prevent        <em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em> (SSK 27:50; for the laws relevant to a
        woman who is engorged, see above 11:17).
    </p>
    <h2>
        5. Carrying Pets and Sick Animals
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we will see later on (23:5), anything that has no practical use on
        Shabbat is <em>muktzeh</em> and may not be carried. Animals are
        included in this category and thus may not be carried on Shabbat. If,
        in order to prevent them from being hurt, it is necessary to move them,
        the Sages permitted pulling them but not picking them up (SA
        308:39-40). At first glance, this would seem to pertain to house pets
like cats and dogs, and indeed, this is the position of        <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> (vol. 2, p. 383) and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
(19:124). However, it seems more reasonable to assume that        <em>muktzeh</em> pertains only to animals with which one does not
        normally play. Pets whose owners play with them and pick them up all
        week long would not be <em>muktzeh</em>, and their owners may thus
        touch them and pick them up on Shabbat. Similarly, seeing-eye dogs are
not <em>muktzeh</em> (<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 5:22:21;<em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 308:74). Although some are stringent,        <em>muktzeh</em> is a rabbinic prohibition so the <em>halakha</em>
        follows those who are lenient.
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn3"

        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        A fish that jumped out of an aquarium and will presumably stay alive if
        it is returned may be put back even though it is <em>muktzeh</em>. This
        is because, when necessary, and when there is no other solution, one
may move a <em>muktzeh</em> object to prevent        <em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em>. Even though some are stringent in this
case, one may rely on the lenient approach (See SA 305:19; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 70; SSK 27:28).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a fish in an aquarium dies, and it is possible that if it is left in
        the aquarium other fish will catch whatever terminal disease it had,
        then even though the dead fish is <em>muktzeh</em>, it may be removed
        from the tank to save the remaining fish. If there is a dog or cat in
        the vicinity, the fish should be fed to them (see SSK 27:29).
    </p>
    <h2>
        6. The <em>Melakha</em> of <em>Tzad</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
Trapping animals was one of the <em>melakhot</em> performed for the        <em>Mishkan</em>. They would trap <em>teĥashim</em> to make curtains
        from their skins and the <em>ĥilazon</em> to produce <em>tekhelet</em>
to dye the curtains (<em>Shabbat</em> 73a; Rashi <em>ad loc</em>.;        <em>Shabbat</em> 75a).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition of <em>Tzad</em> is limited to those animals -
        beasts, birds, or fish - that are normally trapped or hunted for a
        purpose, whether to eat their meat, use their skins, or enjoy their
        beauty (as is the case with parrots). In contrast, one who traps
        species that are not normally hunted, such as flies and other insects,
        violates rabbinic law (<em>Shabbat</em> 106b; SA 316:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        The prohibition of <em>Tzad</em> does not apply to tame animals that do
        not run away from their owners, such as cows, donkeys, and dogs. Since
        in any case they stay with their owners, there is no such thing as
        trapping them (Rema 316:12; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 59). Nevertheless,
        carrying these animals is prohibited, as they are <em>muktzeh</em>.
        When necessary they may be grabbed and dragged into their pen or
        kennel, as long as they are not picked up (SA 308:40; see section 3
        above).
    </p>
    <p>
        If an animal is partially tame in that it runs away when a human tries
        to grab it but returns to its cage at night, its trapping is
        rabbinically prohibited (Rema 316:12: MB <em>ad loc</em>. 57, 59). When
necessary, in order to avoid monetary loss or        <em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em>, one may rely on those who are lenient
        and trap a partially tame animal. (See SA <em>ad loc</em>.; SSK 27:36.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition refers to completely trapping an animal; that is,
        holding it in hand, with ropes, or in a cage such that one can do with
        it as he pleases. Similarly, one who shepherds an animal into an area
        small enough that he can chase and catch it in one motion, he violates
        Torah law. In contrast, if one herds an animal into a large area where
        he would still need to chase it down in order to capture it, he does
        not violate Torah law, as the animal is not well and truly trapped.
        However, this is rabbinically prohibited, because the animal can now be
        more easily trapped. If he subsequently captures it, even though doing
so is easier than usual, he is still violates Torah law, as this is the        <em>Tzad</em><em> </em>that the Torah forbids (<em>Shabbat</em> 106b;
        SA 316:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Hunting with the aid of a dog is forbidden. However, if one commands
        the dog with his voice and does not actually touch it, the prohibition
        is rabbinic. If he takes any action to help with the capture, he
        violates Torah law (Rema 316:2; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 10).
    </p>
    <p>
        A mouse trap may be put out on Friday, since no action is taken on
        Shabbat. However, it is rabbinically prohibited to put out a trap on
        Shabbat. This is not prohibited by Torah law, as it is not certain that
        the trap will succeed in catching anything (MB 316:18).
    </p>
    <p>
        An animal may be freed from a trap on Shabbat. While there is a
        prohibition to trap an animal, there is no prohibition to free an
        animal from a trap on Shabbat (MB 316:25).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who wishes to feed a caged animal or bird whose nature is to try to
        escape must take care not to open the cage even briefly. If he
        mistakenly opened the cage, then if the cage is so small that confining
        the animal or bird to it would be considered <em>Tzad</em><em> </em>by
        Torah law, then the cage may not be closed even <em>be-di’avad</em>. If
        the cage is large enough that confining the animal or bird to it would
        only be rabbinically prohibited, <em>be-di’avad</em> one may close it,
since the animal or bird was inside when Shabbat began (        <em>Pri Megadim</em>; BHL 316:6 s.v. "ve-halakh").
    </p>
    <h2>
        7. Unintentional Trapping
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as one may not chase an animal in order to trap it, so too one may
        not exploit the opportunity to catch an animal that got stuck in a
        confined space. Therefore, if a deer enters a house, the door may not
        be closed behind it. If a bird flies in through a window, the window
        may not be shut behind it (<em>Shabbat</em> 106b; SA 316:5). If one
        wishes to close the door or window in order to protect against thieves
        or the cold, the animal must first be chased out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the household members are having trouble chasing out the animal or
        bird because it is hiding and eluding pursuit, if necessary the door or
        window may be closed. This is because the person doing so does not
        intend to trap the animal or bird, but only to protect the house from
        thieves or the cold. Besides, even after the door or window is closed,
        the animal is not truly trapped, because capturing it is still an
        effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if a window screen has flies on it, and one wishes to close
        the window beyond it in order to prevent the heat or cold from
        entering, he must first chase away the flies so that they are not
        trapped between the window and the screen. If it is difficult to do so,
        the window may be closed even while they are still there, since one
        does not intend to trap the flies, only to protect against the heat or
        cold. Besides, the flies are not truly trapped; even if he wants to
        catch them, he would have to make an effort to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one who wants to close a small box that has flies in it
        should chase them away before closing it. If it is difficult to chase
        them all away, he should leave something between the cover and the box
        in order to create an escape hatch for the flies. If necessary, the box
        may be closed even though a fly will be trapped inside it, since his
        intention is not to trap the fly, but only to close the box. Besides,
        the fly is not truly trapped; even if he wants to catch it, when he
        opens the box it may very well escape.

    <h2>
        8. Slaughtering (<em>Shoĥet</em>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Shoĥet</em>
        <em> </em>
        refers to the <em>melakha </em>of taking the life of a living being.
        For the <em>Mishkan</em>, they slaughtered <em>teĥashim</em> and goats
        in order to use their skins for the curtains (<em>Shabbat</em> 73a,
        75a). <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not only slaughtering that is prohibited. Rather, killing a
        living being in any fashion is forbidden by Torah law. It does not
        matter whether death is brought about by striking, strangling, or any
        other method. One who kills a tiny ant violates Torah law, as does one
        who removes a fish from water, since this kills the fish. Similarly,
        one who reaches his hand into an animal’s womb and aborts its fetus on
        Shabbat violates Torah law (<em>Shabbat</em> 107b).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Torah prohibition applies when the animal is killed for its corpse,
        i.e., to make use of its meat, skin, or blood. In contrast, one who
        kills destructively, such as stamping on ants because he wants them
        dead, transgresses rabbinically.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one is walking and comes across ants, he should jump over them in
        order to avoid killing them and violating a rabbinic prohibition. If
        there is a colony of ants in his path and it is impossible to step
        there without killing ants, he should walk around them. If he is in a
        place where he cannot pass without walking on them, he may continue
        walking, since he does not intend to kill them. It is preferable that
        he walk on the sides of his feet and do his best to avoid killing ants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if there are insects in a toilet and there is a reasonable
        chance that flushing the toilet will kill them, it is preferable, when
        possible, to wait until they fly or crawl away. However, if they do not
        emerge, or if one must flush for the sake of human dignity, he may do
        so.
    </p>
    <p>
        If ants are in a sink and can be blown out of the way, that is best. If
        it is difficult to do so, dishes or hands may still be washed, even
        though this will probably drown the ants. Since the one washing is not
        interested in killing them, and he needs the water, it is not
        prohibited.

    <h2>
        9. Wounding (<em>Ĥovel</em>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as it is prohibited by Torah law to kill any living being, it is
        also prohibited by Torah law to cause a loss of blood. After all,
        "blood is life" (Devarim 12:23). Additionally, with the release of a
        little blood, there is a localized loss of life. This prohibition
        applies even when the blood does not exit the body, but simply
        hemorrhages from blood vessels and accumulates under the skin. This too
        is viewed as a localized loss of life (SA 316:8; BHL s.v. "ve-haĥovel).
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2/Downloads/Shabbat%20II%20MASTER%20FINAL%20(1).docx#_ftn6"

            title=""
        >
            [6]
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Accordingly, if one strikes another person on Shabbat with intent to
        injure and causes a hemorrhage or hematoma, he is not only guilty of an
        interpersonal transgression but also desecrates Shabbat. This is also
        true of one who angrily strikes an animal and causes a hemorrhage or
        hematoma. In addition to violating <em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em>, he
        transgresses the prohibition of <em>Ĥovel</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not do a blood test on Shabbat. Since the goal is to use the
        blood, taking it is prohibited by Torah law. In cases of danger to
        life, of course, it is permitted. It is also forbidden to scratch or
        pick at a scab if doing so will cause it to bleed, or to brush one’s
        teeth in a way that will cause the gums to bleed (as explained in
        14:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        A Jew may administer a shot to one who is ill, even if not dangerously
        so, as long as the injection is into flesh, since this will not
        necessarily cause the sick person to bleed. In contrast, if the shot or
        infusion is done into a vein, it is prohibited for a Jew to administer
        it to one who is not dangerously ill, since there will definitely be at
        least a little blood. However, a non-Jew may be asked to give this
        injection. If the sick person is dangerously ill, even a Jew may give
        the injection (below 28:7).
    </p>
    <h2>
        10. Trapping and Killing Snakes, Scorpions, Mosquitoes, and Other Pests
    </h2>
    <p>
        Danger to life overrides Shabbat. Therefore, animals likely to endanger
        human life may be killed even on Shabbat, like poisonous snakes and
        scorpions. Even if one is unsure whether a particular animal is
        poisonous, he may kill it. Similarly, a dangerous dog or rabid animal
        may be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is prohibited on Shabbat to kill animals whose bites hurt a great
        deal but are not life-threatening. This applies to snakes and scorpions
        that are definitely not poisonous. It is only forbidden to kill them
        the way one would kill them during the week, so one may kill them in
        the course of walking; one walks in their direction and in the course
        of walking steps on them and kills them. The reason for this
        dispensation is that killing an animal in a destructive manner, when
        one does not have any use for the cadaver, is only prohibited
        rabbinically. Thus, in order to avoid great suffering, the Sages
        permitted killing such animals in the course of walking. However, it is
        prohibited to kill them directly, out of concern that people will
        conclude that one may kill animals even when there is no concern that
        they will cause harm. If such animals are chasing a person, they may be
        killed even without a <em>shinui</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if they are not chasing anyone, a receptacle may be placed over
        them in order to neutralize the threat. This does not need to be done
        with a <em>shinui</em>, because the person’s goal is not to trap them,
only to prevent them from stinging or biting (SA 316:7; MB        <em>ad loc</em>. 27).
    </p>
    <p>
        Animals whose stings are not so painful, such as mosquitoes and fleas,
        may not be killed in any manner on Shabbat. If the mosquito or flea is
        clinging to one’s skin and cannot be removed without being grabbed, the
        Sages permitted grabbing it in order to remove it. This is on condition
        that he not kill it or even squeeze it, which might kill it. Even
        though grabbing an animal without intending to use it is rabbinically
        prohibited, the Sages were lenient here since the goal is to avoid
        suffering (SA 316:9). If one wishes to grab a flea and remove it from
        under his clothing rather than from his skin need not be dissuaded from
        doing so (MB 316:37; SHT <em>ad loc</em>. 63).
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are mosquitoes or other pests in a room, one may spray
        insecticide to repel them as long as he does not spray the bugs
        directly and leaves open a window through which they can escape. This
        way he will not necessarily kill any of them. However, one may not
        spray them directly or to spray in a place where they have no means of
        escape, because then he will definitely kill them and transgress a
        prohibition (<em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 3:20; see SSK 25:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may apply liquid mosquito repellent on Shabbat, but not an ointment
        (see above, 14:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may place tablets into a plug-in device that contains a heating
        element that causes the tablets to heat up and release a
        mosquito-repellent vapor. It is proper to place the tablets at a short
        distance from the heating element so that they do not reach the
        temperature of <em>yad soledet bo</em>, which might present a problem
        of <em>Bishul</em> (<em>Ha-ĥashmal Ba-halakha</em> vol. 2, p. 364;
        above 10:4). However, if one is uncertain whether the tablets will
        reach <em>yad soledet bo</em>, he may place them.

            AHS 305:5 forbids taking out a dog wearing dog tags as a sign for
            people to leave it alone. He brings a proof from the rule that
            forbids taking out roosters wearing strings as a similar sign to
            people (SA 305:17). However, SSK ch. 27 n. 34 cites R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach as permitting it, since this sign is for the dog’s
            benefit and protection. In contrast, if the goal is simply to avoid
            paying a fine, the dog tags are prohibited. It would also seem that
            if the sign is permanently attached to the animal’s collar, then it
            is secondary to the collar and is not considered a burden, as
            explained in <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Shabbat</em> 54b, s.v. "mishum";
            MA 305:6; and <em>Eliya Rabba</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Rashi and Ran, one may take out a dog or other animal
            with a collar whose purpose is solely decorative, on condition that
            doing so is the common practice. <em>Tosafot</em> and Rabbeinu
            Yeruĥam maintain that if the collar does not serve a protective
            purpose, it is forbidden. <em>Baĥ</em> rules stringently (MA 305:1;
            MB <em>ad loc. </em>12).

            Even though according to Ramban, milking is only prohibited
            rabbinically, <em>halakha</em> follows the opinion of Rif, Rambam,
            and Rashi that milking is prohibited by Torah law. On account of
            the animals’ suffering, the Sages permitted asking a non-Jew to
milk on Shabbat (most <em>poskim</em> maintain that<em>tza’ar ba’alei ĥayim</em> is Torah law; see<em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Collected Essays</em>            <em> Likutim</em> <em>III</em> 10:6.) If no non-Jew is available, a
            Jew may milk the cows, but in such a way that the milk will go to
waste, since according to Rabbeinu Tam (cited in <em>Tosafot</em>,            <em>Ketubot</em> 6a) one may milk wastefully on Shabbat. Even
            though Ri (cited <em>ad loc.</em>) maintains that one may not milk
            in such a manner, in order to prevent animal suffering we permit it
            (SSK 27:49; <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> 56:4).

            <em>Maharaĥ Or Zaru’a</em>
            §81 permits carrying pet birds in their cage, maintaining that they
            are not <em>muktzeh</em>, albeit while noting that Rosh disagrees
            and maintains that all animals are <em>muktzeh</em>. Indeed, this
            is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> according to MB
            308:146 and SSK 27:27 (<em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 5:26 states that if one
            wishes to move birds in order to prevent their suffering, such as
if the sun is beating down on them, one may rely on            <em>Maharaĥ Or Zaru’a</em>). However, all these discussions relate
            to birds, which are not commonly carried. In contrast, today people
keep house pets and carry them around all week. For this reason,            <em>Igrot Moshe</em> states that birds are <em>muktzeh</em> (OĤ
            4:16) and succinctly that pets are not (OĤ 5:22:21). This is also
the position of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in<em>Shulĥan Shlomo</em> 308:74. Others are stringent (            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, p. 383; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em>
            19:124). As I have written above, the <em>halakha</em> follows
            those who are lenient. Bird cages and aquariums, which are not
            normally carried, are <em>muktzeh</em>. If one normally moves them
            around during the week for decorative purposes, then according to
R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach they are not <em>muktzeh</em> (            <em>Shulĥan</em> <em>Shlomo</em> 308:74:2).

            In order to explain this <em>halakha</em>, we must first point out
            that in all the cases mentioned here, the trapping involved is only
            rabbinically prohibited, for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
            1) The area is large enough that the animals are not truly trapped
            there. (If the box is very small, then <em>Sefer Ha-Teruma</em>
            maintains that the flies are considered trapped, while <em>Tur</em>
            maintains that they are not trapped since they can escape when the
            box is opened.)
        </p>
        <p>
            2) Flies and the like are not species that are hunted. Thus doing
            so is only rabbinically prohibited
        </p>
        <p>
            3) Since the goal is to close the house or box and not to trap
            anything, this is a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>,
            which according to most <em>poskim</em> is only rabbinically
            prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
            In all the cases mentioned above, the intention is not to trap but
simply to close the window. As a result, these are examples of            <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in cases of a double rabbinic
            prohibition. It is generally agreed that in such instances, one can
            be lenient when necessary. In cases of true necessity, we are
            lenient for a <em>psik reisha</em> even if there is only one
            rabbinic prohibition (as explained above in ch. 9 n. 2; see MB
            316:15, SHT <em>ad loc. </em>18, and the upcoming footnote).
            Accordingly, <em>Ĥayei</em> <em>Adam</em> 30:2 and MB 316:5 state
            that if a bird flies into a house and is located in an area large
            enough that trapping the bird would only be rabbinically
            prohibited, one may close a window or door on account of the cold.
            Additionally, one may bring into consideration the following
            opinion of Rashba (<em>Shabbat</em> 107a) based on the Yerushalmi.
            Even though the Sages state: "If a deer enters a house and one
            locks it in, he is liable" (<em>Shabbat</em> 106b), nevertheless
            Rashba writes that as long as his intention in closing the door is
            to protect the house, it is not prohibited. Even though we do not
            follow this Rashba, we can combine his opinion with other
            mitigating factors to support leniency. See <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            Even if it is clear that the ants or other insects will be killed,
            it is a <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> in a case of a double
            rabbinic prohibition, as the act is destructive and is being done
            with a <em>shinui</em>. We saw above (ch. 9 n. 2) that when
            necessary we are lenient in such cases. Even if one insists that
            the killing here is not done with a <em>shinui</em>, it is still a
            case of <em>psik reisha de-lo niĥa lei</em> applying to a rabbinic
            prohibition. In cases of true necessity, we are lenient even in
            such a case (MB 316:5; SHT 321:68, 337:10). Some maintain that we
may be lenient in such a case even <em>le-khatĥila</em> (            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 2:46). If one walks on the sides of his
            feet, then the killing is definitely done with a <em>shinui</em>.
Besides, it is possible that this will not kill them. Even though            <em>Menuĥat Ahava</em> 3:18:10 and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 14:27 are
            stringent, the primary position is the lenient one, as is recorded
in <em>Minĥat Ish</em> 19:9. For a toilet infested with gnats,            <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 10:27 offers additional factors to permit
flushing: human dignity, <em>grama</em>, <em>melakha</em><em>she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>, and maybe even            <em>mitasek</em>. <em>Shevet</em> <em>Ha</em>-<em>Levi</em> 6:94 is
            in agreement.

            <strong>Killing lice</strong>
            : <em>Shabbat</em> 12a records a disagreement about killing lice on
            Shabbat. The conclusion reached there is that killing them involves
            no prohibition, as they spontaneously generate from inanimate
            matter. Now, however, since we know that lice do reproduce, it is
            forbidden to kill them. <em>Halakha</em> is determined in
            accordance with current knowledge. See <em>Harĥavot</em>.

Rashi maintains that <em>Ĥovel</em> is a <em>tolada</em> of            <em>Shoĥet</em>. Several other Rishonim (such as Ran) discuss the
issue but do not make it clear whether <em>Ĥovel</em> is a<em>tolada</em> of <em>Shoĥet</em> or part of the            <em>av melakha</em>. Rambam maintains that <em>Ĥovel</em> is liable
            because of <em>Mefarek</em>, a <em>tolada </em>of <em>Dash</em>.
