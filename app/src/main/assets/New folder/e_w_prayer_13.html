            1. Omissions and Errors in the <em>Amida</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Men of the Great Assembly fixed the prayer formula as a single
        unit, incorporating all main requests, and meticulously established the
        order of the <em>berakhot</em> of the <em>Amida</em>, basing its
        structure on biblical verses (<em>Megilla</em> 17b). Therefore, one who
        skips one of the <em>berakhot</em> of the <em>Amida</em> does not
fulfill the mitzva of prayer. Even if she recites the full        <em>Amida</em>, but rearranges the order of the <em>berakhot</em>, she
        does not fulfill her obligation (SA 119:3).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Additionally, one who errs in one of the <em>berakhot </em>in a way
        that ruins the essence of the <em>berakha</em> - for example, by not
        reciting the <em>berakha</em>’s conclusion or by introducing something
        irrelevant, like a prayer for rain during the summer - is considered
        not to have recited that <em>berakha </em>at all (BHL 119:3). Likewise,
        one who forgets <em>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</em> on Rosh Ĥodesh or on a
        festival must repeat that <em>Amida</em> with<em> Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        These laws are the same for men and women; any situation in which a man
        must repeat his prayer, a woman must as well. Likewise, a circumstance
        in which a man must return to the <em>berakha</em> in which he erred, a
        woman must too (as explained in the next section). Even when a woman
        errs in an <em>Amida</em> she was not obligated to pray, she must
        repeat the <em>Amida</em> correctly. For example, if one who usually
only prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> decides on a certain day to pray<em>Minĥa</em> too, but makes a mistake, she must repeat<em> </em>the<em> Minĥa Amida</em> correctly. Similarly, if one who normally prays<em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> decides one day to pray<em>Ma’ariv</em> as well, but errs, she must repeat the        <em>Ma’ariv</em> <em>Amida</em> correctly. Since she already began to
        pray, she must pray in the manner that the Sages prescribed and if she
        changes their formulations, she must repeat her prayer correctly.

            2. Error and Interruption in the Middle of the <em>Amida</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman who realizes in the middle of the <em>Amida</em> that she
skipped or made a mistake in one of the thirteen middle        <em>berakhot</em> must return to that <em>berakha</em> and continue
        praying from that point on, in the correct order. Even though she
        repeats the <em>berakhot</em> that she already recited, since
        everything after that <em>berakha</em> was not recited in order, it is
        as if she did not say them at all, and she must recite them again in
        their correct sequence (<em>Berakhot</em> 34a according to Rashbam’s
        interpretation; SA 119:3).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If she skips or errs in one of the first three <em>berakhot</em> or one
        of the last three <em>berakhot</em>, either by reciting the wrong words
        in one of these <em>berakhot</em> or by skipping one of them and
        incorrectly starting the next one, she must go back to the beginning of
        the three <em>berakhot</em>. Since the first three <em>berakhot</em>
        possess one theme, as do the last three <em>berakhot</em> (see above,
        12:9), each section is considered one unit. Therefore, anyone who makes
        a mistake in one <em>berakha</em> is considered to have erred in all of
        them and must repeat all three from the beginning (<em>Berakhot</em>
        34a; Rema 114:6; an example of this law appears below in section 8).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who completes the <em>Amida</em> and then remembers that she
omitted or erred in one of the <em>berakhot</em> must repeat the entire        <em>Amida</em>. Even if she has not yet taken three steps back, if she
        finished the prayers of supplication and is about to take steps
        backwards, she must return to the beginning of the <em>Amida</em> (SA
        117:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If one interrupts <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> in the middle, whether
        verbally or silently, and the interruption is brief, she continues
        praying from the point where she stopped. However, if the interruption
is long enough that she could have finished praying the entire        <em>Amida</em> from beginning to end, she returns to the beginning of
        the <em>Amida</em>. Some say that there is no difference between an
        intentional interruption and one due to circumstances beyond one’s
        control. In either case, since there was enough time for her to finish
        the entire <em>Amida</em>, she starts from the beginning (SA 104:5, and
        this is the Sephardic custom). Others maintain that she only returns to
        the beginning of the <em>Amida</em> if the interruption was due to
        circumstances beyond her control; however, if she freely interrupted,
        even for a long time, she returns to the place where she stopped (Rema
        65:1; MB 104:16; this is the Ashkenazic custom). We will explain when
        one may interrupt when necessary below (14:1-2).

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On special days, we add sections to the <em>Amida </em>pertaining to
        the themes of the day. Some additions, if forgotten, prevent one’s
fulfillment of the duty to pray, and other additions must be recited        <em>le-khatĥila</em>, but <em>be-di’avad</em>, if omitted, do not
        preclude one from fulfilling her obligation.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
On <em>Ĥol Ha-mo’ed </em>of Pesaĥ and Sukkot, the        <em>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</em> paragraph is added in <em>Birkat Ha’avoda</em>
        . If one already concluded the <em>Amida</em> but forgot to recite it,
she must repeat the <em>Amida</em>. If she did not yet finish the<em>Amida</em>, she goes back to the beginning of        <em>Birkat Ha’avoda</em>, adds <em>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</em>, and then
continues on until the end of the <em>Amida</em>. We also recite<em>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</em> on Rosh Ĥodesh. If it was omitted in        <em>Shaĥarit</em> or <em>Minĥa</em>, the <em>Amida</em> must be
        repeated. However, if forgotten in <em>Ma’ariv</em> of Rosh Ĥodesh, it
        is not repeated, because when the new month was sanctified in Jerusalem
        based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, there was no sanctification at
night, and so the sanctity of Rosh Ĥodesh does not yet apply at        <em>Ma’ariv </em>(SA 422:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
On <em>Motza’ei Shabbat</em>, we add <em>Havdala</em> (<em>Ata Ĥonantanu</em>)<em> </em>to the <em>berakha </em>of        <em>Ata Ĥonen</em>. If forgotten, it is not repeated, since she will
        fulfill her obligation later with <em>Havdala</em> over wine (SA
        294:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        On Ĥanuka and Purim, <em>Al Ha-nisim</em> is added in <em>Modim</em>.
        If<em> </em>one<em> </em>forgets to recite it, she does not go back,
        since these holidays are rabbinic, and forgetting to mention them does
        not prevent one from fulfilling her obligation (SA 682:1).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
On fast days, individuals add <em>Aneinu</em> in        <em> Shome’a Tefila</em>. Ashkenazim only recite it at <em>Minĥa</em>
        (Rema 565:3), whereas Sephardim recite it throughout the fast: on Tisha
        Be-Av at in <em>Ma’ariv</em>, <em>Shaĥarit</em>, and <em>Minĥa</em>,
and on the other fast days at <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>565:17). Some have the custom to recite it at        <em>Ma’ariv</em> on all fast days (R. Masoud Ĥai Rakaĥ, Maharitz).
        According to all customs, one who forgets to say <em>Aneinu</em> does
        not repeat the <em>Amida</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        During the Ten Days of Repentance from Rosh Hashana through Yom Kippur
        - days of judgment during which God’s dominion is manifest - we
conclude the third <em>berakha</em> of the <em>Amida </em>with "<em>Ha-Melekh ha-kadosh</em>" and <em>Hashiva Shofteinu</em> with "<em>Ha-Melekh ha-mishpat</em>." If one mistakenly says "        <em>Ha-Kel ha-kadosh</em>" in the third <em>berakha</em>, she must
        return to the beginning of the <em>Amida</em> since, as we have
        learned, the first three <em>berakhot</em> are considered one unit, and
        anyone who makes a mistake in one of them must go back to the
beginning. If she corrects herself immediately (        <em>tokh kedei dibur</em>), that is, within the amount of time it takes
        to say three words at a normal pace, she continues praying.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If one accidentally concludes <em>Hashiva Shofteinu</em> as usual (with
"<em>Melekh ohev tzedaka u-mishpat</em>") and does not correct herself        <em>tokh ke-dei dibur</em>, according to the custom of Ashkenazim and
        some Sephardim, she fulfills her obligation <em>be-di’avad</em>,
        because even in the regular formulation the word "<em>Melekh</em>"
        ("King") is used (Rema 118:1; <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>,<em> Nitzavim </em>
        19; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>1). Other Sephardim maintain that she does
        not fulfill her obligation because she did not recite the correct
wording for the Days of Awe. Therefore, if she has not yet finished her        <em>Amida</em>, she must return to <em>Hashiva Shofteinu</em>, conclude
        it appropriately, and continue until the end of the <em>Amida</em>. If
        she already finished the <em>Amida</em>, she must pray again while
        stipulating that if she was not obligated to repeat the prayer, the
        second prayer is considered voluntary (SA 118:1; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em>
        1:57).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There are four other additions made during the Ten Days of Repentance:
"<em>Zokhreinu</em>," "<em>Mi Kamokha</em>," "<em>U-khetov</em>," and "<em>Be-sefer Ĥayim</em>." If any of them are forgotten, the        <em>Amida</em> is not repeated (SA 582:5).

            4. Voluntary Prayer (<em>Tefilat Nedava</em>)
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
As mentioned (above, 1:7), the Sages instituted three daily prayers:<em>Shaĥarit</em> corresponding to the morning<em> Tamid</em> offering;        <em>Minĥa</em> corresponding to the <em>Tamid</em> of the afternoon;
        and <em>Ma’ariv</em> corresponding to the burning of the organs and
        fats upon the altar (above, 2:2-5 we learned which prayers are
        obligatory for women). Just as when the Temple existed every woman was
        permitted to bring voluntary offerings, so too, a woman may recite an
        additional voluntary <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. As R. Yoĥanan states:
        "Would that a person pray all day long" (<em>Berakhot</em> 21a). In
        order for her prayer to be recognized as voluntary, she must add some
sort of special personal request in that prayer. Moreover, just as a        <em>musaf</em> sacrifice may not be offered voluntarily, so too one may
        not pray <em>Musaf</em> voluntarily. And just as voluntary offerings
        are not sacrificed on <em>Shabbatot</em> and festivals, so too there
        are no voluntary prayers on those days (SA 107:1-2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who wishes to recite a voluntary prayer must be certain that she is
        careful and capable enough of having <em>kavana</em> in her prayer from
        beginning to end. If she cannot concentrate well, she is not to recite
        a voluntary prayer at all (SA 107:4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Nowadays, the accepted teaching is that we do not recite voluntary
        prayers because we do not have the proper <em>kavana</em>.
        Nevertheless, a woman who wishes to pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> even though
she is exempt may do so, and her prayer is not considered a        <em>tefilat nedava</em>. Therefore, even if she is not completely sure
that she can have <em>kavana</em> for the whole prayer, she may pray        <em>Ma’ariv</em> and it is a credit to her.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="LTR">
        <a name="_Toc402175257">5. Situations of Uncertainty</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman who prays <em>Shaĥarit</em>, <em>Minĥa</em>, or both on a
        regular basis and is not sure on a particular day whether or not she
        recited one of these prayers, as long as the time for its recitation
        has not yet passed, she recites the prayer and makes mental
        stipulation: "If I already prayed, this prayer is considered a
        voluntary prayer, and if not, this is an obligatory prayer." It is
        unnecessary to introduce any personal requests into that <em>Amida</em>
        , since the fact that she is avoiding <em>safek</em> is itself
        something novel. Even though we do not recite voluntary prayers
        nowadays, we are permitted to do so in order to avoid uncertainty. If,
        in the middle of that <em>Amida</em>, she remembers that she already
        prayed, she continues to recite the <em>Amida</em> until the end and
        adds a personal request to demonstrate that it is, indeed, a voluntary
        prayer.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one starts to pray on the basis that her prayer is obligatory,
        thinking that she did not yet pray, but suddenly remembers in the
        middle of her <em>Amida</em> that she already did, she must stop
        immediately. Her prayer cannot become voluntary, for just like there is
        no offering that is partly obligatory and partly voluntary, so too,
        there is no prayer that begins as obligatory and ends as voluntary (SA
        107:1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who is daydreaming in the middle of her prayer to the point where
        she is unsure what part of the <em>Amida</em> she is reciting, for
instance, one who is pondering whether she is reciting the sixth<em>berakha</em> or the tenth, must return to the sixth        <em>berakha</em> and start to pray from that point on (according to
        most <em>poskim</em>, as cited in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch.
        18 n. 3).

            6. Making Up a Missed Prayer (<em>Tashlumin</em>)
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
A woman who regularly prays once daily and did not manage to pray        <em>Shaĥarit</em> before <em>ĥatzot</em> (as explained above, 8:1) must
wait until half an hour after <em>ĥatzot</em> and then pray        <em>Minĥa</em>. If she does not manage to pray <em>Minĥa</em> before
        sunset, she prays <em>Ma’ariv</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who regularly prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em> every day
        is subject to <em>tashlumin </em>- the enactment of make-up prayers. If
        she forgets <em>Shaĥarit</em>, she prays <em>Minĥa</em> twice, the
first time as <em>Minĥa</em> and the second to make up for the missed        <em>Shaĥarit</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If she forgets <em>Minĥa</em> but regularly prays <em>Ma’ariv</em>, she
        makes up the missed <em>Minĥa</em> after <em>Ma’ariv.</em> If she does
        not usually pray <em>Ma’ariv</em>, she may pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> if she
        wishes and then pray another <em>Amida</em> after that to make up for
        the missed <em>Minĥa</em>. However, she is not obligated to do this
        since she would not normally pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> and thus would not
        normally have the opportunity to make up for the missed <em>Minĥa</em>.
        Nevertheless, one may certainly not make up the missed <em>Minĥa </em>
        after <em>Shaĥarit</em>, for the Sages enacted <em>tashlumin </em>to
        make up for an immediately preceding prayer that was missed. Once the
        time for that subsequent prayer has lapsed, <em>tashlumin</em> is no
        longer an option (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 18:5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one forgets to pray <em>Minĥa</em> on <em>Erev Shabbat</em> and
        wants to make it up after <em>Ma’ariv</em> of Shabbat, the make-up
        prayer follows the text of the Shabbat <em>Amida</em> (<em>ibid.</em>).

        The make-up prayer must be recited after the obligatory one. If one
        intended to recite her first prayer as the make-up and the second one
as the obligation, she has not fulfilled her obligation of<em>tashlumin</em>, and she must pray a third <em>Amida</em> as        <em>tashlumin</em> (<em>ibid</em>.).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One should pause between the two recitations of the <em>Amida</em> for
the amount of time it takes to walk four <em>amot</em>.<em>Be-di’avad</em>, if one was supposed to make up a missed<em>Shaĥarit</em> but forgot to pray <em>tashlumin</em> right after<em>Minĥa</em>, she may make it up as long as the time for        <em>Minĥa</em> did not yet lapse, meaning as long as the sun did not
        yet set (<em>ibid</em>.).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There is no <em>tashlumin </em>for <em>Musaf</em>, since <em>musaf</em>
        offerings are only brought on specific days. Similarly, one who forgot
        to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> on a day that <em>Musaf</em> is recited
        cannot make up <em>Shaĥarit</em> with an extra <em>Musaf</em> and
        instead must make it up after <em>Minĥa</em> (<em>ibid</em>.).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        <em>Tashlumin</em>
        was only instituted for one who was unable to pray due to circumstances

one who intentionally missed one of the prayers may not make it up (        <em>ibid</em>.).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        During the winter season, we mention rain twice in the <em>Amida</em>.
        At the beginning, we invoke rain to praise God, Who causes rain to
        fall; afterwards, we ask God to bless us with dew and rain.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
In the second <em>berakha</em> of the <em>Amida</em>,        <em>Meĥayei Ha-meitim</em>, we praise the One "Who makes the wind blow
        and the rain fall" ("<em>Mashiv ha-ru’aĥ u-morid ha-gashem</em>"). The
        Sages instituted this praise in this particular <em>berakha</em>
        because rain gives life to the world.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In the ninth <em>berakha</em>, <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>, we request
rain. According to Sephardic custom, the entire wording of        <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em> changes from winter to summer. According to
        Ashkenazic custom, the wording of <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em> in the
        summer and in the winter is identical, with the exception of the words
        "<em>ve-ten tal u-matar livrakha</em>" ("give dew and rain as a
        blessing") in the winter and "<em>ve-ten berakha</em>" ("give
        blessing") in the summer. (Yemenite Jews have an altogether different
        text, though the halakhic rule is the same.)
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Although both the invocation and request of rain are recited in the
        winter, there is a difference between them. We invoke rain throughout
        the rainy season, whereas we request it only when we actually wish for
        it to begin falling.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        We begin invoking rain on Shemini Atzeret. Technically, it could be
        invoked from the beginning of Sukkot, which coincides with the
        beginning of the rainy season. However, rain on Sukkot is considered an
        inauspicious omen since it prevents us from fulfilling the mitzva of
        sitting in the <em>sukka</em>. Therefore, we do not invoke rain then.
        The Sages therefore chose <em>Musaf</em> of Shemini Atzeret, when the
        entire community is in the synagogue, as the moment that it is
        announced to everyone that we begin invoking rain. <em>Ma’ariv</em> was
not chosen because not everyone comes to the synagogue for        <em>Ma’ariv</em>, and <em>Shaĥarit </em>was not chosen because the
        announcement may not be made right before the <em>Amida</em>, as we may
not interrupt between redemption and prayer (<em>Beit Yosef </em>and        <em> </em>SA<em> </em>114:1-2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The time to begin <strong>requesting </strong>was postponed for fifteen
        days to allow those who made the pilgrimage from the area of the
        Euphrates River to the Temple in Jerusalem for Sukkot to return home
without being rained upon. Thus, we begin requesting rain at        <em>Ma’ariv </em>on the seventh night of the month of Marĥeshvan (SA
        117:1). Even after the destruction of the Temple, this custom was not
        abolished, since any practice that reminds us of the glory days of the
Temple is cherished. Only after the Temple is rebuilt will the        <em>Sanhedrin</em> be able to determine whether or not to change the
        time that we start requesting rain, taking into consideration
        contemporary means of transportation.

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        We continue to invoke rain until the first day of Pesaĥ, when we still
invoke rain in <em>Shaĥarit</em> but begin invoking dew in        <em>Musaf</em>. Regarding the request for rain, since the request is
        only made on weekdays, the last time we request rain is <em>Minĥa</em>
        of <em>Erev Pesaĥ</em>.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who mistakenly invokes rain in the summer must go back and correct
        her mistake, since there is no praise in mentioning rain at that time.
        If she did not yet finish the <em>berakha</em>, she goes back to the
        beginning of it and says "<em>Morid ha-tal</em>," as should be recited
        in the summer. If she already finished the <em>berakha</em>, she must
        start the <em>Amida</em> over from the beginning in order to recite it
        properly (SA 114:4).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who mistakenly did not invoke rain in the winter but instead
        invoked dew as though it was summer need not repeat it since she
        invoked praise that relates to water. However, if she did not mention
        dew either, she must repeat the <em>Amida</em>, since she omitted such
        important words of praise (<em>ibid. </em>5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who mistakenly <strong>requests</strong> rain in the summer: since
        she made an inappropriate request in <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>, she
must go back and correct it. Therefore, if she did not finish her        <em>Amida</em> yet, she returns to <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>, recites
it properly, and continues in order from there until the end of the        <em>Amida</em>. If she already finished the <em>Amida</em>, she repeats
        the <em>Amida</em> properly from the beginning (<em>ibid. </em>117:3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If, by mistake, one <strong>did not request</strong> rain in the
        winter, it depends how much of the <em>Amida</em> she already recited.
        If she did not yet reach <em>Shome’a Tefila</em>, she continues her
        prayer and when she arrives at <em>Shome’a Tefila</em>, in which one
        may make any request, she requests rain, thereby correcting her
        mistake. However, if she already passed <em>Shome’a Tefila</em>, she
        must return to <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>, recite it in accordance with
        the <em>halakha</em>, and then continue in the proper order, repeating
        all of the <em>berakhot </em>that come after <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>.
        If she already finished the <em>Amida</em> and was about to take three
        steps back, her prayer is considered lacking since she did not request
        rain, and it must be repeated properly in its entirety (<em>ibid. </em>
        4-5).

        <a name="_Toc402175261">9. A Suggestion for Avoiding Mistakes</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The most frequent mistakes made when reciting the <em>Amida</em>
        concern the invocation and request of rain because we grow accustomed
        to a particular text over the course of six months and then abruptly
        shift to a different wording. As we learned, three of the four possible
        errors require one to repeat the <em>Amida</em>. (One must repeat her
        prayer in the following situations: 1. if she requested rain in the
        summer; 2. if she did not request rain in the winter; and 3. if she
        invoked rain in the summer. One does not repeat her prayer if she
        forgot to mention rain in the winter and instead mentioned dew.)
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one is not sure whether she recited the correct words, as long as
        thirty days have not passed since the change in formulation at the
        beginning of the summer or winter, we assume that she most likely
        erred, since she is still in the habit of using the earlier formula. If
the presumed mistake is one that necessitates a repetition of the        <em>Amida</em>, she must do so. However, if thirty days have passed,
        people have become accustomed to the change in wording and we may
        assume that she most likely recited the correct wording. She therefore
        need not repeat the <em>Amida</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In order to avoid uncertainty, due to which it is often necessary to
        repeat the <em>Amida</em>, it is a good idea for one to habituate
        herself to the new wording by repeating it ninety times on the day of
        the change. In that way, even if she is not sure whether she recited
        the proper wording, she may presume that she recited it correctly, and
she need not repeat the <em>Amida</em> (SA 114:8-9;        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 18 n. 4). Therefore, on the night
        of 7 Ĥeshvan, Sephardim should habituate themselves to beginning the
paragraph properly (since they replace the entire paragraph of<em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em>) by reciting the last words of the preceding<em>berakha </em>and the first words of <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em> ("        <em>Rofei ĥolei amo Yisrael</em>,<em> Barekh aleinu</em>") ninety
        times. Ashkenazim should habituate themselves to insert the proper
phrase by repeating "<em>Ve-et kol minei tevu’ata le-tova</em>,<em> ve-ten tal u-matar li-vrakha</em>" ninety times. At<em>Musaf </em>on the first day of Pesaĥ, she says "        <em>Meĥayei meitim Ata rav lehoshi’a</em>,<em> morid ha-tal</em>"
ninety times. Then, before <em>Ma’ariv</em> on the first night of<em>Ĥol Ha-mo’ed</em>, Sephardim would say "        <em>Rofei ĥolei amo Yisrael, barkheinu</em>" ninety times, and
Ashkenazim would say "        <em>ve-et kol minei tevu’ata le-tova, ve-ten berakha</em>" ninety times
        (MB 114:40; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>60). She thereby accustoms herself to
        the new formula, and if a doubt subsequently arises as to whether or
        not she recited the right words, she need not repeat her prayer.

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Sages determined Babylonian Jews begin asking for rain on the
        sixtieth day of the season (calculated to be December 4 or 5). Since
        there is an abundance of water from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, it
        is unnecessary to request rain in Babylonia from the very beginning of
        winter. All Jews living outside of Eretz Yisrael follow the Babylonian
        custom and begin requesting rain on the sixtieth day of the season (SA
        117:1).

        to local custom (<em>Birkei Yosef</em>). In any situation of
        uncertainty, one should request rain in <em>Shome’a Tefila</em> and not

In places that require rain in the spring, the request for rain in        <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em> should not be continued after Pesaĥ. Instead,
        the status of those places resembles the status of individuals: in
        those places, one requests rain in <em>Shome’a Tefila</em> (SA 117:2;

        center of the Jewish world, Jews everywhere follow it and request rain
        when it is winter there. When they must request rain for themselves,
        they do so in <em>Shome’a Tefila</em>. However, people in southern
        locales where summer rain causes damage do not follow the practice
        Eretz Yisrael so as not to request something that is harmful for them.
Instead, all year round they recite the summer formula of        <em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em> and request rain in <em>Shome’a Tefila</em>.
        During their winter they keep their place of residence in mind, and

            repeat and correct an <em>Amida</em> that she was not obligated to
            pray. However, the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that
she must repeat the prayer, just as a man who erred in            <em>Ma’ariv</em> must repeat<em> </em>the<em> Amida</em> even

            <em>Tashlumin </em>
            for women, including the issue of making up Friday <em>Minĥa </em>
            at Shabbat <em>Ma’ariv</em>,<em> </em> is addressed in MB 263:43
            and <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>263:65. <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em>: Prayer,
ch. 13 n. 10 infers from MB that a woman who regularly prays            <em>Minĥa</em>, even if she does not usually pray <em>Ma’ariv</em>,
            must pray <em>Ma’ariv </em>so that afterward she may make up the
            missed <em>Minĥa</em>. Nevertheless, it seems more plausible that
            MB suggests the best course of action but does not regard it as an
obligation. Moreover, perhaps many women were accustomed to praying            <em>Ma’ariv</em> on Shabbat night, and therefore MB recommended
            making up the <em>Minĥa</em> prayer after <em>Ma’ariv</em> without
intending to obligate women to do so. (See            <em>Halikhot Bat Yisrael</em> 2:20 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 30 n.

requesting rain, she continues to do so in<em>Birkat Ha-shanim</em> (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>13, in the name of            <em>Kesher Shel Gudal</em>); 3) If she leaves with her family for
