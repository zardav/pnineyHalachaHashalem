1. Principles Behind the Prohibition of Benefiting from        <em>Melakha</em> Done on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Torah commands us to refrain from <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat. The
Sages added a protective fence by prohibiting deriving benefit from        <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat (<em>ma’aseh Shabbat</em>), as it is
improper to benefit on Shabbat from Shabbat desecration. Whether the        <em>melakha</em> was done knowingly (<em>be</em>-<em>mezid</em>) or
        unknowingly<em> </em>(<em>be-shogeg</em>), it is forbidden for any Jew
        to benefit from the <em>melakha</em><em> </em>for the rest of that
Shabbat. Some maintain that if the <em>melakha </em>was done        <em>be-shogeg</em>, one may<em> </em>benefit from it. Some rely on this
        opinion under pressing circumstances (as explained in the next
        section). For our purposes, <em>shogeg</em> means that one was aware of
        his actions but forgot that it was Shabbat or was unaware that this act
        is a forbidden <em>melakha </em>on Shabbat; we have translated it, here
        and elsewhere, as "unknowing."
    </p>
    <p>
        After Shabbat, anyone may benefit from a <em>melakha</em> that was done
        on Shabbat except for the perpetrator, if he did it <em>be-mezid</em>,
        who may never benefit from it (SA 318:1, as explained in section 7
        below).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a small child performed a <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat on behalf of
        an adult, during Shabbat no one may benefit from it. On Saturday night,
anyone may benefit once enough time has passed that the        <em>melakha</em> could have been completed after Shabbat. If the child
        did the <em>melakha</em> for his own sake, an adult may benefit from it
        on Shabbat (above, 24:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a non-Jew did <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat for a Jew, no Jew may
benefit from it until enough time has elapsed after Shabbat for the<em>melakha</em> to have been completed, so that no one benefits from        <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat and no one profits from work done by a
non-Jew on Shabbat (above, ch. 25 n. 2). If a non-Jew did a        <em>melakha</em> for himself, a Jew may benefit from it on Shabbat
(above, 25:2). In some cases, one may hint to a non-Jew to do        <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat (above 25:3). For the sake of a mitzva, or
        to avoid great loss or suffering, one may ask a non-Jew to do a
        rabbinically prohibited <em>melakha</em> (25:4).
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. The Prohibition of Benefiting from a <em>Melakha</em> Performed on
        Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we have seen, if a Jew knowingly performs a <em>melakha</em> on
        Shabbat, neither he nor any other Jew may benefit from it during
        Shabbat. Even if he did the <em>melakha</em> unknowingly, according to
        most <em>poskim</em> no one may benefit from it, because the Sages did
        not want any Jew to benefit from <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat (SA
        318:1). Others maintain that only if the <em>melakha</em> was done
        knowingly is it forbidden to benefit from it on Shabbat; in contrast,
        if the <em>melakha</em> was done unknowingly, one may benefit from it.
        Some allow one to rely on this opinion when necessary (MB 318:7). A
        non-observant Jew who is aware that it is Shabbat and that the action
        he is taking may be prohibited is considered to be transgressing
        knowingly. Even those who are lenient maintain that one may not benefit
        from his <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat.

    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if a Jew turned on a light on Shabbat, neither he nor any
        other Jew may benefit from the light. As we have already seen, some
        maintain that under pressing circumstances, as long as the light was
        turned on unknowingly, one may benefit from it. Under normal
        circumstances, though, or if the light was turned on knowingly, one may
        not benefit from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, if one could have engaged in a certain activity with
        difficulty even without the light, one may also engage in this activity
        after the light is turned on. For example, if a light in a stairwell
        was turned on on Shabbat, as long as one could have ascended the stairs
        in the dark, one may do so in the light. However, one should not run up
        the stairs, as this would constitute taking advantage of the light. If
        a bathroom light was turned on on Shabbat, one may still use the
        bathroom, since one could have done so without light as well. However,
        if one could not have arranged certain items in one’s home without the
        light, one may not arrange them using the light. If there was
        originally enough light to read, even with difficulty, and then an
        additional light was turned on, one may continue reading even though it
        has become easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a light in a room was on and one knowingly turned it off, one may
        sleep in the room. Even though it is now easier to sleep there, it is
        permitted, since there is no direct benefit from the <em>melakha</em>;
        it simply removed an impediment to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a Jew turned on a radio or music player on Shabbat, one may not
        benefit by listening to it. However, if it would be inconvenient to
        leave the room, he need not do so, since the sound was turned on
        against his wishes, and he does not want to benefit from it. Even if a
        non-Jew turned on such a device, one still may not benefit from it,
        both because it is a weekday activity and because it detracts from the
        honor due Shabbat (above 22:19).
    </p>
    <p>
        One is not obligated to stay out of his room because his roommate
sinned by turning on the heat in their shared room. However,        <em>le-khatĥila</em> he should try to prevent his roommate from
        transgressing. If he was unsuccessful, he should have in mind not to
        benefit from the prohibited action. He should not move toward the
        heater in order to warm up. Rather, he should remain in his usual
        place. If he benefits against his will, he is not transgressing. If he
        can open a window in order to avoid benefiting from the heat, this is
preferable (based on Rema 276:1; AHS<em> ad loc.</em> 4; MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 11-13).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p>
Some maintain that one must not even fulfill a mitzva through a        <em>melakha</em> that was performed on Shabbat. Others maintain that
        since <em>mitzvot</em> were not given for our benefit, doing a mitzva
        cannot be considered deriving benefit from a <em>melakha</em>. In their
        opinion, if a light was turned on during Shabbat, one may study Torah
        or pray by its light. One who wishes to follow this leniency has an
        opinion to rely on. However, if food was cooked on Shabbat, all agree
        that one may not eat it. Even though eating it would fulfill the mitzva
        of <em>oneg Shabbat</em>, since the way one fulfills this mitzva is by
        experiencing pleasure, it would violate the Sages’ decree forbidding
        benefit from a <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat. Similarly, if a light
        was turned on during Shabbat, one may not eat by its light.

    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. Cases In Which Deriving Benefit Is Permitted
    </h2>
    <p>
        The prohibition on deriving benefit on Shabbat from the unknowing
performance of a <em>melakha </em>applies only to a case of a        <em>melakha</em> that is prohibited by Torah law. In contrast, if a
        rabbinically prohibited action was done unknowingly, one may benefit
        from it on Shabbat. Nevertheless, if it was done knowingly, it has the
        same status as a Torah prohibition: one may benefit from it only after
        Shabbat (MB 318:3 and BHL <em>ad loc.</em>; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
318:3). For example, the Sages prohibited separating <em>teruma</em>,<em>ma’aser</em>, and <em>ĥalla</em> on Shabbat, because it resembles        <em>tikun </em>(fixing or improving) of the produce. If one unknowingly
        performed the separation on Shabbat, the "improved" produce may be
        eaten on Shabbat, but if he did this knowingly, it may not be eaten
        until after Shabbat (MB 339:25; above 22:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one unknowingly turned on an electrical appliance without a heating
        element (e.g., a fan, air conditioner, or refrigerator), since some
        maintain that this action is not prohibited by Torah law, one who
        wishes to be lenient and benefit from the appliance has an opinion on
        which to rely. However, if one turned on a heater with metal heating
        coils or a light bulb with an incandescent filament, he has definitely
        transgressed a Torah prohibition. Thus, even if it was done
        unknowingly, he may not benefit from the results of his action on
        Shabbat. In the case of the heater, he should open the window or leave
        the room to avoid benefiting from the <em>melakha</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If one performed a <em>melakha</em> obliviously (<em>mitasek</em>),
there is no prohibition on deriving benefit from it, since the<em>melakha</em><em> </em>had no intent. This is true even if the        <em>melakha</em> is prohibited by Torah law. For example, if one
        absentmindedly brushed his hand or leaned against a light switch and
        turned it on, one may derive benefit from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a difference between <em>shogeg</em> and <em>mitasek</em>. As
        noted, <em>shogeg</em> means that one was aware of his actions but
forgot that it was Shabbat or was unaware that this act is a forbidden<em>melakha </em>on Shabbat. When the Temple stood, one who did a        <em>melakha</em> <em>be-shogeg</em> was obligated to bring a sin
offering. In contrast, <em>mitasek </em>means that one did a        <em>melakha </em>obliviously, without being aware of his actions. Such
an act did not obligate its perpetrator to bring an offering. Since        <em>mitasek</em> is less severe than <em>shogeg</em>, there is no
        prohibition to benefit from what was done obliviously.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if one absentmindedly turned on a light out of habit, as he
does all week long when entering a room, he is considered        <em>shogeg</em>. Even though he was not thinking explicitly about what
        he was doing, nevertheless since the intent of his action was to turn
        on the light, he is considered <em>shogeg </em>and one may not derive
        benefit from his <em>melakha</em>.
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. Benefiting from an Action That Did Not Alter an Item
    </h2>
    <p>
        Some say that if a <em>melakha</em> did not physically alter an object,
        like if it was transported from a public domain to a private domain,
        the item does not become prohibited, and one may benefit from it on
        Shabbat in the private domain (Rabbeinu Yona and Ritva). The same would
        apply to food that was transported via motor vehicle on Shabbat; since
        the food itself underwent no change, it would not be prohibited.
However, others maintain that there is no difference between types of<em>melakhot</em> (<em>Tosafot</em>, Ramban, and Rashba). Even if the        <em>melakha</em> did not alter the food at all, one may not benefit
        from it on Shabbat if it was transported in a prohibited fashion. In
        practice, <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is proper to be stringent, but under
        pressing circumstances one may rely on those who are lenient,
        particularly if the <em>melakha</em> was done unknowingly.
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a <em>melakha</em> that was performed on Shabbat enables an
        additional, permissible action to occur, one may benefit from the
        permissible action. For example, if a hammer was fixed on Shabbat, it
        may not be used, even for permitted purposes like cracking nuts.
        However, if one violated this prohibition and cracked nuts with the
        hammer, he may benefit from the nuts, since the act of cracking the
        nuts is not intrinsically forbidden.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a locked door was unlocked in a forbidden fashion, such as with the
        use of an electronic key card, some say that one may not enter the room
        through that opening, since the door was unlocked in a prohibited
        fashion. Others maintain that one may enter, since unlocking the door
        did not create anything new; it simply removed an impediment to
        entering. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, in a time of need, one may be lenient.
        If a refrigerator door was opened and the refrigerator light went on,
        one may remove food from the refrigerator (see above, 17:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a Jew who does not observe Shabbat approached an automatic door and
        thus caused it to open, one may not enter through it. Only under
        pressing circumstances may one be lenient. If another Jew passed by and
        unintentionally caused the door to open, one may enter through it (see
        above, 17:11).
        <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. If One Did an Action of Disputed Permissibility
    </h2>
    <p>
        The prohibition on benefiting from a <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat
        only applies when the action is clearly prohibited. However, if the
        action is the subject of dispute, even if general practice follows the
stricter opinion, one may benefit <em>be-di’avad</em> from the        <em>melakha</em>. This is because the entire foundation of the
        prohibition on benefiting from work done on Shabbat is rabbinic, and
        since we are lenient whenever there is a uncertainty pertaining to a
        rabbinic rule, we follow the lenient position in the dispute over
        whether this act is prohibited (<em>Pri Megadim</em>; MB 318:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if one cooks raw meat, it is clear that he has
        transgressed, and the food may not be eaten on Shabbat. However, if one
        took partially-cooked food that is edible under pressing circumstances
        and placed it on a fire until it cooked fully, it may be eaten on
        Shabbat. Even though the <em>halakha </em>follows the opinion that
        doing so is prohibited by Torah law (SA 318:4), since there is an
        opinion that if the food was already edible, cooking it further is not
        prohibited (above, ch. 10 n. 1), if one transgressed and cooked such
        food on Shabbat, it may be eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if one took cold soup that had been cooked before Shabbat
        and heated it on a <em>plata</em> on Shabbat, although many maintain
        that he has violated Torah law (SA 318:4), it may be eaten, because
        Rambam allows doing this (above, 10:5-6).
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us say one took a tea bag, put it in a glass, and poured boiling
        water over it directly from an urn, which is a <em>kli rishon</em>.
        Doing so is prohibited because, according to most <em>poskim</em>,
        pouring boiling water from a <em>kli rishon</em> cooks the outer layer
        of the food (above, 10:7-8). Nevertheless, <em>be-di’avad </em>one may
drink the tea, because some maintain that one does not violate        <em>Bishul</em> by pouring hot water over a tea bag, only by placing
        the tea bag directly into a <em>kli rishon</em> (Rashbam, Ramban,
        Rashba).
    </p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. Power Outages
    </h2>
    <p>
        If there is a power outage, whether local or citywide, Jewish
        technicians may do what is necessary to restore power to all the area’s
        residents. This is because many areas have sick people whose lives
        would be at risk without the electric equipment they need. Because of
        the possibility of loss of life, the area’s electricity supply must be
        restored. Moreover, since the restoration is permissible, all residents
        of the neighborhood may benefit from it (above, 17:5). If there was
        food on the <em>plata</em> that cooled down while the electricity was
        off and then warmed up again when the electricity was restored, it may
        be eaten even if the food was not fully cooked beforehand, and only
        finished cooking after the electricity was restored, since it was
        cooked in a permissible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a small area lost electricity and it is clear that there is no risk
        to life involved, one may not restore the electricity. If the
        electricity was nevertheless restored, and as a result a light came on,
        one may not benefit from it. This means that anything that could not
        have been done without the light may not be done using the light (as
        explained in section 2 above). If food warmed up as a result of the
        electricity that was restored impermissibly, one must wait until it
        cools off before eating it. If food finished cooking as a result of
        this transgression, one may not eat it (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach cited
        in SSK ch. 32 n. 182; see above, 10:3).
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Benefiting after Shabbat from a <em>Melakha</em> Performed on
        Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
As we have learned, one who performs a <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat        <em>be-shogeg </em>may benefit from it immediately after Shabbat, as
        may other Jews. If he transgressed <em>be-mezid</em>, he may never
        benefit from it, though others may benefit from it after Shabbat. For
        example, if one knowingly cooked food on Shabbat, he may never eat it.
        Others, including those he cooked for, may eat the food after Shabbat
        (MB 318:5). Similarly, if one built a house on Shabbat, others may
        benefit from it after Shabbat, but he may never use it. However, he may
        sell the house to others (MB 318:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        One who knowingly laundered his clothes on Shabbat may not wear them
even after Shabbat, because one may never benefit from a        <em>melakha </em>that he performed knowingly on Shabbat. A solution in
        such a case is to wash the clothes again during the week, after which
        he may wear them (<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, Year 2, Vayeĥi 19).
    </p>
    <p>
        If a non-observant Jew regularly performs <em>melakha</em> on Shabbat
        for other Jews, they may not benefit from this <em>melakha</em> even
        after Shabbat. Only when a <em>melakha </em>is done occasionally may
        those on whose behalf the <em>melakha </em>was done benefit from it
        after Shabbat, as there is no concern that they will ask him to
        desecrate Shabbat again so that they can benefit after Shabbat.
        However, if he does this <em>melakha</em> regularly, they may never
        benefit from it. For example, one may not buy bread from one who
        regularly bakes it on Shabbat in order to sell it after Shabbat, even
        if all the ingredients are kosher. Eating it encourages him to continue
        desecrating Shabbat, and they would take part in his transgression.
        Similarly, no Jew may eat at a restaurant where a Jewish chef cooks on
        Shabbat for customers who will come after Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not watch sports games or other televised events after Shabbat
        if these events were filmed by Jews on Shabbat. Since the filming
        involved intentional Shabbat desecration on the part of the
        videographers for the sake of their viewers after Shabbat, the viewers
        may not benefit from this Shabbat desecration. The same applies to
        fruits and vegetables brought to market on Sunday. If it is known for
        certain that they were picked by Jews on Shabbat, no Jew may eat them.
        <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        Technically, one may buy dairy products from a dairy farm that
        desecrates Shabbat when milking the cows (see above 20:4), because the
        milk produced on Shabbat is mixed with the milk produced on other days.
        Thus, for any bag of milk that one buys, it is uncertain whether it was
milked on Shabbat. Since the prohibition of benefiting from        <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat is rabbinic, in cases of uncertainty
        we may be lenient. This also applies to a factory that produces paper
        all week long, including Shabbat. Technically, one may buy its paper.
        Nevertheless, it is always preferable to buy products from factories
        and companies that observe Shabbat. If all Shabbat observers were to
        unite in order to strengthen Shabbat observance, it would be possible
        as a temporary measure to forbid any benefit from the products of
        factories that desecrate Shabbat (see <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:72,
        74-5; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 25:57-61).
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. After Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        Starting half an hour after Shabbat ends, one may listen to news
        broadcasts produced by Jews, since sufficient time has elapsed for the
        producers to have collected the material and write the stories after
        Shabbat. However, one who listens to the news immediately after Shabbat
        transgresses the prohibition on benefiting from <em>melakha</em> done
        on Shabbat. Starting fifteen minutes after Shabbat, one may listen to
        other types of programs, because in that amount of time a news program
        can be prepared for broadcast. Even if the technicians and newscasters
        live far from the studio and desecrated Shabbat to travel to the
        studio, since the listeners gain nothing from this desecration, it is
        not forbidden to listen to the broadcast.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Shabbat is over in Israel, one may not listen to broadcasts by
        Jews in America, since Shabbat there ends between seven and ten hours
        later than in Israel. Thus, one who listens in Israel would be
        benefiting from the Shabbat desecration of American Jews. For the same
        reason, one who is in Israel must wait approximately two hours after
        Shabbat ends before listening to Jewish broadcasts from Western Europe.
        In contrast, one may listen to broadcasts produced by non-Jews
        immediately after Shabbat in Israel ends.

        One may travel by bus starting half an hour after Shabbat, as that is a
        reasonable amount of time for the bus driver to reach one’s stop
        without having desecrated Shabbat. If the bus route is so long that it
        is clear that the driver started the route when it was still Shabbat,
some forbid riding the bus (<em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 9:39;<em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 25:62), and others permit (        <em>Mishneh Halakhot</em> 7:50). Many maintain that there is
        technically no prohibition because one who boards the bus half an hour
        after Shabbat does not benefit from the fact that the bus traveled on
        Shabbat; nevertheless, they continue, it is proper to be stringent as a
protective measure (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 13:48; SSK 59:9;        <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:76).

        9. Interacting with Non-Observant Jews and <em>Lifnei Iver</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Torah commands: "Do not put a stumbling block before the blind"
        (Vayikra 19:14), meaning that one may not cause another person to
        transgress (MT, Laws of a Murderer 12:14). This commandment is known as
        "<em>lifnei iver</em>" ("before the blind").<em> </em>If the other
        person would have transgressed even without his aid, many maintain that
        the accessory has not transgressed the Torah prohibition on causing
        others to sin. However, he has transgressed the rabbinic prohibition of
        aiding (<em>mesayei’a</em>) a transgressor. Therefore, one may not
        allow a non-observant Jew to borrow his car or radio on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, one may not give directions to a Jew who is driving on
        Shabbat and stops to ask for directions, even if the driver may
        actually end up spending more time driving without directions. There
        are two reasons for this. First, one may not aid a transgressor.
        Second, one may not speak on Shabbat about things that are prohibited
        on Shabbat (above 22:9). It is proper to apologize to the driver and
        explain that giving him directions is forbidden on Shabbat.

    <p>
        An observant soldier may leave the light on in the bathroom before
        Shabbat, even though he knows that at some point a non-observant
        soldier will turn it off. One does not need to waive his right to leave
        the light on just so that his non-observant friend does not transgress
        by extinguishing the light. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume
        that his non-observant friend would turn the light on and off in any
        case (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach cited in <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em>
        31:5).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may invite a non-observant Jew for an entire Shabbat, even if he
        knows that after Friday night dinner his friend will drive home. This
        is as long as one honestly offers him a place to stay, such that the
        invitation does not necessitate Shabbat desecration. Although some
        forbid this, one may be lenient when one’s intent is to spread love
        among Jews, bringing people closer to Torah and to each other. However,
        sometimes it is proper to be stringent for educational reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are stringent and forbid a synagogue to host the celebration of a
        bar mitzva from a non-observant family when it is clear that some of
        the guests will drive to the synagogue. They maintain that the
        synagogue’s agreement to host the bar mitzva is like accepting and
        aiding Shabbat desecration. Others permit it on the grounds that these
        guests would be desecrating Shabbat in any case. Furthermore, the
        synagogue members did not ask anyone to drive, and in fact they would
        prefer that people come on foot. In practice, as long as the
        non-observant guests are respectful of the synagogue and are careful
        not to desecrate Shabbat inside it, the synagogue may host the bar
        mitzva. Nevertheless, according to many, it is still preferable to
        advise the family to have the boy called up to the Torah on a Monday or
        Thursday during <em>Minĥa</em> instead of on Shabbat.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a similar disagreement about hosting a <em>brit mila</em> on
        Shabbat when it is clear that many family members will desecrate
        Shabbat by driving to the <em>brit</em>. In practice, a <em>mohel</em>
        may perform the <em>brit</em> on Shabbat in this situation.

        10. Keeping Websites and Vending Machines Open on Shabbat
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a Jew owns a vending machine, and most of its users are Jewish, he
        must disable it for Shabbat in order to avoid aiding their desecration
        of Shabbat. If most of the customers are non-Jews, he need not disable
        it (see SSK 29:28-29 and n. 75). The money that the non-Jews put in the
        vending machine is not considered payment for work done on Shabbat,
        since they are paying primarily for the product and not to operate the
        machine itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some maintain that websites designed for a Jewish audience must be
        disabled on Shabbat so that they do not aid transgression. Since this
        is difficult practically, the site owner is not obligated to take them
        down; after all, the site visitors can easily desecrate Shabbat by
        visiting other sites, and as long as the site owner has done nothing to
        promote his site on Shabbat, there is no prohibition. However, if the
        site is primarily commercial, and most prospective customers are Jews,
        it means that the owner of the site benefits from the Shabbat activity,
        so he must make efforts to disable it for Shabbat. If this is very
        difficult, it is not obligatory. Since those who access the site are
        already desecrating Shabbat knowingly and regularly, some maintain that
        the prohibition of aiding someone’s transgression does not apply. In
        contrast, if most of the customers are non-Jews, it is not necessary to
        disable the website for Shabbat. The purchases made on Shabbat are not
        considered payment for work done on Shabbat since the work to set up
        the site was done during the week.

            According to R. Meir, one who cooks on Shabbat unknowingly may eat
            the food on Shabbat, while one who cooks knowingly may eat the food
            only after Shabbat. According to R. Yehuda, if one cooked food on
            Shabbat, whether knowingly or unknowingly, no one may eat from the
            food on Shabbat. After Shabbat, others may always eat the food. The
            one who cooked the food may eat it after Shabbat only if he cooked
it unknowingly, while if he did so knowingly he may never eat it (            <em>Ĥullin</em> 15a). Since there is an accepted principle that in
            a disagreement between R. Meir and R. Yehuda we follow R. Yehuda,
most Rishonim rule that one may not benefit on Shabbat from            <em>melakha</em> that was done unknowingly. This is the opinion of
            Rif, Rambam, Ramban, and many others. This is also the ruling of SA
318:1. Nevertheless, according to a minority of <em>poskim</em> (            <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Ĥullin</em> 15a; <em>Sefer Ha-Teruma</em>;
            Ritva; Vilna Gaon), in this case the <em>halakha</em> follows R.
            Meir, since the Talmud goes on to say that Rav taught his students
            R. Meir’s opinion on the topic. MB<em> </em>states that in a time
            of need, one may benefit from an unknowing violation on Shabbat
            (318:7). However, if one picked fruit unknowingly on Shabbat, even
            those who are lenient concede that one may not benefit from it,
            since it is <em>muktzeh</em>.

This is the ruling in <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 34:1-2 and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:36. It would also seem to be the opinion
            of <em>Har Tzvi</em>, OĤ 1:185. However, the one who turned on the
            light, the heat, or the radio knowingly, as well as the person who
            told him to do so, technically must leave the room in order to
avoid benefiting from the <em>melakha</em> (MB 276:13;            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:14, n. 20).

            See <em>Sdei Ĥemed</em> (<em>Kuntres Ha-klalim, Ma’arekhet Mem</em>

also cited in <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 33:7 and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:18-20. When dealing with a physical
            pleasure such as eating, one should be stringent, as it is not
            clear that any authority would be lenient. See <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>
            62:6 and <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 1:126. When there is no physical
            pleasure involved, then since it is a rabbinic dispute, one who
            wishes to be lenient has an opinion to rely on. This applies even
            more so if the <em>melakha</em> was done unknowingly, as then one
            can take into account the authorities who follow R. Meir and permit
            benefiting from it.

            As we have seen above (17:2 and n. 1), according to many
            contemporary authorities, turning on an electric appliance with no
            incandescent filament or heating element is only rabbinically
            prohibited. Even though in practice we tend to be stringent and
            treat turning on electricity as a Torah prohibition, here we may
            also take into account the opinion of those who follow R. Meir.
            According to him, even if one transgresses a Torah prohibition, as
            long as it was unknowing, one may derive benefit from it. This is
            the approach of <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 318:56.

            Among those who say <em>mitasek</em> does not constitute a
transgression are <em>Leĥem Mishneh</em> (1:5) and<em>Eretz Tzvi</em> §76. Some are stringent and maintain that even            <em>mitasek</em> constitutes a transgression, and therefore one may
            not derive benefit from a <em>melakha </em>done <em>be-mitasek</em>
            (<em>Oneg Yom Tov</em>; <em>Minĥat Barukh</em>). According to R.
Akiva Eger, in some cases <em>mitaskek</em> has the same status as            <em>shogeg</em>. Nevertheless, in practice, one may be lenient in
            all cases of <em>mitasek</em>. First, the prohibition on benefiting
            from <em>melakha</em> done on Shabbat is rabbinic, so in cases of
            uncertainty we are lenient. Second, the <em>poskim</em> who follow
            R. Meir are permissive even in the case of <em>shogeg</em>. This is
also the opinion of <em>Az Nidberu</em> 6:17 and            <em>Yalkut Yosef </em>318:23. See <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 25:4.

            According to Rabbeinu Yona and Ritva, if the object was not
            physically altered, the prohibition of <em>ma’aseh Shabbat</em>
does not apply to it. This is also the opinion of            <em>Korban Netanel</em>. In contrast, <em>Tosafot</em>, Ramban, and
            Rashba as well as <em>Har Tzvi</em> maintain that this is not
            grounds for leniency. In practice, if the <em>melakha</em> was done
            unknowingly, in times of need one may be lenient. (This is the
            implication of <em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 9:11; MB 318:7; and BHL 318:1
            s.v. "aĥat.") Under pressing circumstances, one may be lenient even
            if the <em>melakha</em> was done knowingly, since the prohibition
            of <em>ma’aseh Shabbat</em> is rabbinic. See <em>Yabi’a Omer</em>,
            10:25. This applies when soldiers have been brought food by a
            vehicle on Shabbat: under pressing circumstances, they may eat the
            food. However, if their consumption of the food will cause
additional Shabbat desecration in future, they should not eat it (            <em>Ha-tzava Ka-halakha</em> 35:10). All agree that if fruit was
            knowingly brought from outside the <em>teĥum</em> (at a height of
            under ten <em>tefaĥim</em>), one may not benefit from it, as
            explained in <em>Eruvin</em> 41b and SA 405:9. According to
            Rabbeinu Yona, the reason for this is that the Sages reinforced
            their own safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
Regarding <em>melakha</em> performed by a non-Jew, all agree that            <em>Hotza’ah </em>is just as severe as other <em>melakhot</em>. For
            example, if a non-Jew delivered something to a Jew via an action
            that is prohibited on Shabbat by Torah law, the Jew may not benefit
            from it until enough time has elapsed after Shabbat that the item
            could have been brought after Shabbat. This is to make sure that
            Jews do not ask non-Jews to do <em>melakha </em>for them on
Shabbat. If a non-Jew performed a rabbinically prohibited            <em>melakha</em>, then the Jew for whom the <em>melakha</em> was
            performed may not benefit from it until enough time has elapsed
            after Shabbat that the <em>melakha</em> could have been done. Other
            Jews may benefit from it even on Shabbat (SA 325:10), as explained
            in 25:1 above.

According to <em>Mor</em> <em>U-ketzi’a</em>,            <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em>, and <em>Nehar Shalom</em>, if a fire
            was lit on Yom Tov (which is prohibited) and then used to cook
            food, one may benefit from the food since cooking is not prohibited
            on Yom Tov (in opposition to <em>Taz</em> 502:1, which forbids).
This indicates that one may benefit from a consequence of            <em>ma’aseh</em><em> Shabbat</em>. A key that was transported via a
            public domain is subject, as we saw in the previous note, to a
            disagreement about whether one may benefit from a <em>melakha</em>
            that did not physically alter an object. Under pressing
            circumstances, one may be lenient. In any case, if the door has
            already been unlocked with that key, entering through the doorway
            does not constitute benefiting from the transgression itself, but
            rather from a consequence. As we said, in such a case one may
            benefit. This is the opinion of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R.
            Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (however, <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 2:77
            prohibits; see 2:71 as well).
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, if a door was unlocked in a prohibited fashion, such
            as with an electronic key card, then it would seem that one may not
            benefit by entering, since the very act of unlocking was done in a
            prohibited manner. (As we saw, according to <em>Tosafot</em>,
Ramban, and Rashba, <em>ma’aseh Shabbat</em> applies to            <em>Hotza’ah</em> even though the item is not changed.) This is
            certainly the position of <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, and it seems to be
            that of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach as well. Nevertheless, according
            to R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (cited in <em>Melakhim Omnayikh</em>,
            p. 525), it is permissible because opening the door is simply
            removing an impediment, and this kind of benefit is not prohibited.
            Furthermore, even without this explanation, we saw above in n. 6
            that under pressing circumstances one may rely upon the opinion of
            Rabbeinu Yona. If a refrigerator door was opened and the
            refrigerator light went on, even R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach allows
            removing food from the refrigerator, since the light was turned on
            only incidentally (SSK 10:16 and n. 47). For further discussion of
all these cases, see <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 25:29-32 and §14 in the            <em>Birurim</em> section.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a non-observant Jew opened an electric door by approaching it,
            one should be stringent and avoid taking advantage of his
            transgression, as doing so is a desecration of God’s name. However,
            under pressing circumstances, where there is no choice, one may
            rely on Rabbeinu Yona (as mentioned above in 17:11 and n. 11).

            If a Jew knowingly cooked on Shabbat for his friend, after Shabbat
            only the cook may not enjoy the food; the friend may do so
            immediately after Shabbat, as explained in <em>Beit Yosef</em> and
            MB 318:5. However, <em>Responsa</em> <em>Ketav Sofer</em>, OĤ 50
            limits this law to a case in which the cook is an observant Jew; in
            contrast, if the cook is a <em>mumar</em>, a Jew who regularly
            commits this transgression, then the people for whom he undertook
            the <em>melakha</em> may never benefit, because that would
encourage him to continue desecrating Shabbat.            <em>Responsa Har Tzvi</em>, OĤ 180 is lenient and allows the people
            for whom the <em>melakha</em> was done to benefit after Shabbat, as
            long as the desecration was not done in accordance with their
            wishes. Nevertheless, many Aĥaronim maintain that one should be
            stringent (<em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:30:1; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
            318:6 and 318:71-76; <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 25:8).

            A pot in which a non-observant Jew knowingly cooked kosher food on
            Shabbat, according to MA<em> </em>(following Rashba), has the same
            status as the food he cooked and is therefore prohibited until he
            performs <em>hagala</em>. <em>Pri Megadim</em> and MB 318:4 state
            this as well. Others maintain that only the food is forbidden, not
            the pot. This is the lenient position of Ra’ah and Rosh, who are
not discussing <em>ma’aseh Shabbat </em>but rather            <em> bishul akum</em>,<em> </em>the general prohibition for Jews to
eat food cooked by a non-Jew. The laws of <em>ma’aseh</em><em> Shabbat</em> are not as strict as those of<em>bishul akum</em>. For example, in the case of<em>bishul akum</em> no Jew may ever eat the food, while with            <em>ma’aseh Shabbat</em> the food is forever forbidden only to the
            person who cooked it (and according to R. Meir, even the cook may
            eat it if he cooked the food unknowingly). Accordingly, the lenient
            position of Ra’ah and Rosh in a case of <em>bishul akum</em> should
certainly apply to <em>ma’aseh</em><em> Shabbat</em> as well (            <em>Erekh Ha-shulĥan</em> 318:1; <em>Livyat Ĥen</em> §42). In any
            case, according to all opinions, a pot that was used to cook food
            on Shabbat may be used by anyone besides the cook, the same way
            that they may eat the food itself after Shabbat.

            R. Avigdor Nebenzahl reports in the name of R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach (in the journal <em>Kotlenu</em> vol. 14, pp. 254-255)
            that it is preferable to give the driver directions so as to
minimize his driving on Shabbat. Nevertheless,            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 15:18 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> vol. 2, p.
            180 prohibit doing so. See <em>Re’akha Kamokha</em>, pp. 152-156.
            There is a dispute regarding the nature of the prohibition of
            aiding a Jew to transgress in a situation where he can transgress
even without that aid. Some say that the prohibition is rabbinic (            <em>Tosafot</em>; Rema, YD 151:4); according to others, Rabbeinu
Ĥananel and Rambam maintain that it is prohibited by Torah law (            <em>Melumdei Milĥama</em>, p. 33f); still others maintain that if
            the transgressor is a <em>mumar</em> and sins knowingly, there is
            no prohibition at all (<em>Shakh</em>, YD 151:6). It is generally
            assumed that the prohibition is rabbinic.

            According to <em>Igrot Moshe</em> (OĤ 1:98-99 and 4:71), one may
            not invite a non-observant Jew to a Shabbat event if it is clear
            that he will drive, but if necessary, he may notify the
            non-observant acquaintance of the event. <em>Shevet Ha-Levi </em>
            8:256 states this as well. <em>Shevet Ha-Levi</em> 1:205 and 4:135
            forbid holding a <em>brit</em> on Shabbat if this will lead people
            to desecrate Shabbat by driving to the <em>brit</em> and taking
            pictures. In contrast, R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach says that one may
            invite a non-observant Jew for Shabbat as long as the guest is
            given the opportunity to stay without desecrating Shabbat. This
opinion is cited in <em>Rivevot Ephraim</em> 7:402 and<em>Sho’alin Ve-dorshin </em>vol. 2, pp. 18-19.            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 6:3 states that one may hold a <em>brit</em>
on Shabbat even when this may lead to Shabbat desecration. See            <em>Re’akha Kamokha</em>, pp. 157-163. In the text above, I am
            lenient, since non-observant Jews will desecrate Shabbat in any
            case. Besides, while they are in the synagogue they will not
            desecrate Shabbat, so one is not aiding them in their transgression
            by inviting them but in fact minimizing it. Nevertheless, to ensure
            that a bar mitzva celebration is free of transgression, it is
            preferable to celebrate by having the boy called up to the Torah on
a Monday or Thursday at <em>Minĥa</em>. The guests may form a            <em>minyan</em> for this purpose. Since some of the participants
            will not have heard the Torah reading that normally takes place
every Monday and Thursday morning, they may read the Torah with the<em>berakhot</em> as part of <em>Minĥa</em> (            <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Prayer</em> 22:9). This way, there is
            no problem with traveling or taking pictures of the event. In
            contrast, performing a <em>brit</em> <em>mila</em> on the baby’s
            eighth day is mandated by the Torah; if the eighth day is Shabbat,
            the <em>brit</em> should take place on Shabbat.

            See also <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 22:41. In n. 55, it states that a
            commercial website has the same status as a vending machine. It is
true that some are stringent, as discussed in            <em>Kedushat Ha-Shabbat</em> vol. 2, p. 15f. Nevertheless, what I
            wrote in the main text seems most reasonable. This is also the
            conclusion of <em>Responsa</em> <em>Be-mar’eh Ha-bazak</em>
5:37-40. I will now explain the underlying principles. According to            <em>Responsa Maharil Diskin</em> (<em>Kuntres Aĥaron</em> §145),
one is not obligated to spend money to avoid violating            <em>lifnei iver</em>, even though it is a Torah prohibition.
            According to <em>Atzei Ĥayim</em> (YD 5), one need not spend money
            to avoid <em>mesayei’a</em>, as it is only a rabbinic prohibition
            (though one would need to spend to avoid <em>lifnei iver</em>). In
any case, leaving a website up is certainly no more than            <em>mesayei’a</em>, as there are always alternative websites.
            According to <em>Shakh</em>, there is no prohibition at all of
            aiding a <em>mumar</em>’s violation of <em>halakha</em>. Therefore,
            if it is difficult for one to take down his website for Shabbat, he
            is not obligated to do so. Furthermore, the owner of the website is
            not transgressing the prohibition of buying and selling on Shabbat,
            since he is not doing anything. Rather, what takes place on the
            site is a commitment to complete the transaction. The money is not
            collected from the customer’s account until after Shabbat. If a
            site earns money based on page views or subscriptions, we can say
            that the payment is for setting up the site and publishing content,
            which is how we permit paying rent or for use of a <em>mikveh</em>
            on Shabbat. It is assumed that the payment is for the cleaning and
heating of the premises, which takes place before Shabbat (            <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>,<em> </em>OĤ 2:26; see above, 22:14 and n.
            9). We may also take into account the position of BHL 244:6, which
            permits accepting money for work done on Shabbat if one would
otherwise sustain a major financial loss. One need not worry about            <em>marit ayin</em>, since everyone understands that no Shabbat
            desecration on the part of any Jew is necessary in order to keep a
            website open on Shabbat.
