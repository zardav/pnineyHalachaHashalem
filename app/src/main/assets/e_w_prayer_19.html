The Sages teach (<em>Berakhot</em> 60b), "When going to bed one recites        <em>Shema </em>until <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a </em>(i.e., the first
paragraph of <em>Shema</em>) and says the blessing ‘        <em>Barukh Ha-mapil Ĥevlei Sheina</em>…’ (‘Who brings the bonds of
        slumber down upon my eyes…’)" Likewise, R. Yehoshua b. Levi said, "Even
        if one recited <em>Shema</em> in the synagogue, it is a mitzva to
        recite it on his bed." The Sages support their words with the verse
        (Tehilim 4:5), "Meditate in your hearts [while] on your beds, and be
        silent <em>sela</em>" (<em>Berakhot</em> 4b). There is no difference
        between men and women concerning these laws.

        R. Yehoshua b. Levi would recite two additional psalms before his
sleep: "<em>Yoshev Be-seter Elyon</em>" (Tehilim 91) and "        <em>Hashem Ma Rabu Tzarai</em>" (Tehilim 3), which are effective
        against harmful entities (<em>Shevuot</em> 15b); many have adopted this
        practice. Over the years, additional psalms and verses have been added
        as customary recitations. Since these are late additions, the versions
differ according to community. Some recommend reciting        <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em> as well, and recommend reciting all three
        paragraphs.

        In sum, according to the enactment of the Sages, one must recite the
        first paragraph of <em>Shema</em> and <em>Ha-mapil</em> before going to
        sleep, but the remaining psalms are not required. Nevertheless, many
        follow the custom of R. Yehoshua b. Levi and recite these psalms to
        ward off harmful entities (see MA 239:2).

        Some are careful to recite <em>Ha-mapil</em> right before going to
        sleep, after reciting <em>Shema</em> and all the other verses. However,
according to kabbalistic custom, <em>Ha-mapil</em> precedes        <em>Shema</em> and the other verses. One who is concerned that she will
fall asleep before concluding the prayers should start with        <em>Shema</em> and <em>Ha-mapil</em>, thereby ensuring that she will
have recited passages that the Sages instituted before falling asleep (        <em>ibid</em>.).

    <p dir="LTR">
        Some are concerned that after reciting <em>Ha-mapil</em> they will not
        fall asleep, rendering it a <em>berakha le-vatala</em>. However, the
        fact that the Sages instituted <em>Ha-mapil</em> means that they were
        not concerned about this. <em>Ha-mapil</em> is a <em>berakha</em>
        thanking God for sleep, and even if one does not manage to fall asleep,
        the expression of thanks is not made in vain (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em>
        35:4). Still, the Sages instituted this recitation for those who intend
        to sleep, and therefore one who does not plan sleeping on a given night
        does not recite <em>Ha-mapil</em>.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Ha-mapil</em>
is not recited on daytime sleep, although some recommend reciting        <em>Vi-yhi No’am</em> before taking a daytime nap (MB 239:8 and BHL
        s.v. "Samukh"). <em>Ha-mapil</em> is also not recited on temporary
        sleep at night. However, sleeping in one’s bed for at least half an
hour is considered regular sleep (<em>Eshel Avraham</em> §239;        <em>Beit Barukh</em> 35:10).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who went to sleep at night after reciting <em>Ha-mapil</em>, later
        rose to handle certain matters, and then went back to sleep does not
repeat <em>Ha-mapil</em>, since it is only recited once a night (        <em>Beit Barukh</em> 35:9.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who fell asleep without reciting <em>Ha-mapil</em> and woke up in
        the middle of the night with the intention of falling back asleep
        recites the <em>berakha</em> before going back to sleep. She must rub
        her hands on her blanket before reciting it in case her hands touched
the normally covered parts of her body (SA<em> </em>4:23; MB 61; unlike<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 239:1 which states that        <em>netilat yadayim </em>is required).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Some infer, based on Arizal’s mystical teachings, that only one who
        goes to sleep before <em>ĥatzot </em>recites <em>Ha-mapil</em>. Hence,
        many Sephardim recite <em>Ha-mapil</em> without God’s name when going
to sleep after midnight (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 239:8; see        <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at </em>vol. 4:70). However, according to practice of
        Ashkenazim and some Sephardim<em>,</em> one recites <em>Ha-mapil </em>
        as long as she goes to sleep before dawn.

    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who recited <em>Shema</em> and <em>Ha-mapil</em> and then must
talk, eat, drink, or tend to an urgent matter may do so since        <em>Ha-mapil</em> is not like a <em>Birkat Ha-nehenin </em>concerning
        which one may not interrupt between the <em>berakha</em> and the
        benefit derived. Rather, it is a <em>berakha</em> of praise for the
        night’s sleep. However, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, it is best to recite the
bedtime <em>Shema</em> immediately before sleep (see Rema 239:1;<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 7:27; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:70;<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 239:3; however MB 239:4 is stringent after        <em>Ha-mapil</em>).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One may recite the bedtime <em>Shema</em> while lying down, but the
Sages teach that a man must take care to lean on his side (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 26:3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The <em>Ba’alei Mussar</em> (Jewish moralists, especially of nineteenth
        and twentieth-century Europe) recommend a nightly detailed
        introspection. If one remembers sinning, she should confess her sin and
        resolve not to perpetrate that sin again. It is also proper that before
        one goes to sleep one forgives anyone who sinned against her or caused
        her harm so that no one is punished because of her. By doing so, she
        merits long life (MB 239:9).

Although MA (239:2) states that women do not customarily recite            <em>Ha-mapil</em> because it is a time-bound commandment, still,
            the remaining <em>poskim</em> (SHT 239:16; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em>
            239:3; <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 13:22) maintain that since the
            recitation of <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Ha-mapil</em> serve as
            protection, and women need protection just as much as men, women,
            too, must recite <em>Shema</em> and say <em>Ha-mapil</em>.

The Sages only instituted the recitation of the first paragraph of            <em>Shema</em> before going to sleep, as Rif (<em>Berakhot </em>3a
            in the Rif pages), Rambam<em>,</em> and Rosh (<em>Berakhot </em>
            1:6) write. However, in 9:23, Rosh cites Rabbeinu Ĥananel, who
            maintains that <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em> is recited as well.
Perhaps Rabbeinu Ĥananel understood the Gemara’s words "until            <em>Ve-haya im Shamo’a</em>" to be inclusive of the second
            paragraph<em>.</em> <em>Divrei Ĥamudot</em> (<em>ad loc. </em>7)
interprets Rosh’s opinion to refer to a locale where            <em>Ma’ariv </em>was recited before <em>tzeit ha-kokhavim</em> ,
making it necessary to recite the first two paragraphs of            <em>Shema </em>before going to sleep. Rabbeinu Yeruĥam (3:2) and
            Rabbeinu Yona in <em>Sefer Ha-yir’a</em> state that all three
            paragraphs are recited, for together they contain 248 words, and
            saying them provides a special protection against harmful entities.

            <em>Berakhot</em>
            5a states: "R. Naĥman says: A Torah scholar recite <em>Shema</em>
            on his bed (for his learning protects him). Abaye says: Even a
            Torah scholar must recite one verse invoking God’s mercy, such as,
            ‘Into Your hand I entrust my spirit. You redeem me, Lord, God of
            truth’ (Tehilim 31:6)." Rif and Rosh mention that a Torah scholar
            is not obligated to repeat <em>Shema</em>, but Rambam and SA do not
            mention this, implying that according to them, a Torah scholar must
also repeat it. Perhaps the source for their opinion is            <em>y. Berakhot </em>1:1<em>,</em> which discusses Torah scholars
            who recited <em>Shema</em> several times in order to fall asleep
            while saying<em> Shema</em>. Nevertheless, regarding the other
            verses, the recitation of which is not obligatory, it seems that a
            Torah scholar may opt to fall asleep while learning from a book or
            while deep in thought. However, <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 239:1 states
            that by reciting Arizal’s formula for the bedtime <em>Shema</em>,
            one effects a <em>tikun</em>, and therefore even a Torah scholar
            must recite it.

According to <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, <em>Pekudei</em> (Year 1) 12,<em>Ha-mapil</em> is not recited with God’s Name (            <em>Shem U-malkhut</em>), lest the one saying it interrupt by
talking or does not fall asleep. Nonetheless, according to most            <em>poskim</em>, it is recited with God’s name because talking does
            not render the <em>berakha</em> invalid, and there is no need to be
            concerned that the person reciting it will not fall asleep.
