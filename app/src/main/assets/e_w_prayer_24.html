    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Following their exile and dispersion, Jews of different communities
        developed varying prayer rites. The fundamentals of prayer – the
elements instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly – such as        <em>Birkhot Keri’at</em> <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Amida</em>, the
differences are very slight. Even the primary elements of        <em>Korbanot</em> and <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, which were established
        during the time of the Talmud and the Ge’onim, have only minor
        variations. The modifications are more noticeable, however, in the
        additions that accreted during the period of the Rishonim, such as in
        the full routine of <em>Korbanot</em> and in the concluding sections of
        the prayer service, differ greatly from one community to the next. What
        was added to the Sephardic liturgy was not necessarily accepted in
        Ashkenaz, and vice versa. This is especially apparent with regard to
        the liturgical poems composed during the time of the Ge’onim and
        Rishonim and which were incorporated into the prayer service of the
        Days of Awe and festivals. Hence, we find major differences between the
        different prayer rites when it comes to the liturgical poems recited on
        the Days of Awe.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        There are also differences between various ethnic communities when it
        comes to pronunciation of both Hebrew consonants like <em>tzadi</em>
        and <em>kuf</em> and vowels like <em>kamatz</em> and <em>ĥolam</em>. It
        is best that every Jew continue in her family’s custom, for every
extant Jewish tradition for pronunciation is valid for prayer (<em>Igrot Moshe </em>OĤ 3:5; additionally, even the formula of the        <em>ĥalitza </em>ceremony, in which, according to all opinions, every
        letter must be enunciated, any community’s pronunciation scheme is
        valid).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Arizal explains the different prayer rites with a tradition that the
        heavens have twelve portals, corresponding to the twelve tribes of
        Israel. The prayers of each tribe ascended through its unique portal.
        This is the esoteric meaning of the twelve gates mentioned at the end
        of the book of Yeĥezkel (<em>Sha’ar Ha-kavanot</em> p. 50, 4). This is
        the practical <em>halakha </em>as well: every Jew must follow the
        custom of her forebears (MA 68:1; MB 68:4; below we will learn of the
        cases in which one may change one’s <em>nusaĥ</em>).

            2. No <em>Nusaĥ</em> should be Considered Better than Another
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
Ĥida writes in the name of Arizal that prayer recited the Sephardic        <em> nusaĥ</em> ascends through any of the twelve gates. Therefore, in
his opinion, Ashkenazim may switch to the Sephardic <em>nusaĥ</em> (see        <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 6:10; <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 3:6). In contrast,
Ĥasidim claim that their <em>nusaĥ</em> (called "        <em>Nusaĥ Sepharad</em>" even though it was developed as the liturgy of
        Eastern European Ĥasidic communities and was not practiced in Sephardic
        communities) is superior. They maintain that the greatest Ĥasidim
        investigated and examined numerous versions of the liturgy based on
        kabbalistic meanings and halakhic considerations and and selected the
        best among them. The Yemenites, too, claim that their <em>nusaĥ</em> is
        most precise, for the Jews of Yemen, in all their years of exile, did
        not wander. Rather, in response to Arab persecution of Yemenite Jews,
        these communities intensified their dogged and meticulous preservation
        of their customs. Indeed, Yemenite Torah have been found to be closest
        in their precision to the Aleppo Codex, the standard of precision for
the Torah text. Of course, those who pray in the Ashkenazic        <em>nusaĥ</em> also assert that their custom is the most meticulous,
        transmitted from person to person as far back as Shimon Ha-Pekuli.
        Furthermore, the basis for Sephardic custom lies with the Amora'im and
        Ge’onim of Babylonia, whereas Ashkenazic custom originates with the
Amora'im and Ge’onim of Eretz Yisrael, who were more proficient in        <em>aggada</em>, esoteric wisdom, and liturgy. Incidentally, the reason
        for certain similarities between the Ashkenazic and the original
        Yemenite <em>nusaĥ</em> (Baladi), is that both were influenced by the
        Ge’onim<em> </em>of Eretz Yisrael.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In general, every rite has advantages, and it is not in our power to
determine which one is superior. As states in        <em>Responsa Ĥatam Sofer</em> (1:15), every <em>nusaĥ</em> is equal,
and the fact that Arizal offered mystical interpretations of        <em>Nusaĥ</em> <em>Sephard</em> is because he was accustomed to praying
        in that <em>nusaĥ</em>. Had he been accustomed to praying in the
Ashkenazic <em>Nusaĥ</em>, he would have composed mystical        <em>kavanot </em>for that rite.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even if we were to know that a particular custom is more precise, it
        would still be proper for everyone to continue practicing their
        received customs, for continuing ancestral traditions is a strong basis
        for faith. Moreover, even less accurate rites certainly have specific
        points in their favor that we must be careful to preserve. Only after
        the <em>Sanhedrin</em> is established will we be able to institute a
uniform <em>nusaĥ</em>, which will incorporate the benefits of each        <em>nusaĥ</em>. Yet even then, there will be room for different
        emphases in supplementary prayers and distinct melodies, corresponding
        to the twelve gates; each community according to its ways.

        <a name="_Toc402175363">3. Immigrants and Communities That Migrated</a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In the past, when the distance between communities was great,
        Ashkenazim lived in Ashkenaz (Germany), Sephardim in Sepharad (Iberia),
        and Yemenites in Yemen. Anyone who moved elsewhere would adopt the
        halakhic and liturgical customs of the new locale, since it is
        important that every individual community have a uniform custom and
avoid the sort of factionalism that constitutes the prohibition of "        <em>lo titgodedu</em>" (Devarim 14:1; the verse literally prohibits
cutting oneself in mourning for the dead, but the Sages [        <em>Yevamot </em>13b] interpreted the prohibition to include becoming
        fragmented into different factions ["<em>agudot agudot</em>"]). As the
        Sages teach, this prohibition mandates that a single rabbinical court
        may not have some judges who follow the rulings of Beit Shammai and
        others who follow the rulings of Beit Hillel, so that the Torah is not
        made into two Torahs<em> </em>(<em>ibid. </em>14a, according to Rif and
        Rosh).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Thus, immigrants would adopt fixed local customs. This is why we find
        people with the name "Ashkenazi" – denoting German origins – following
        Sephardic custom and families with the name "Frank" – indicating
        Sephardic origins – following Ashkenazic practice.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even if, over time, immigrants become the majority of a given
        community, as long as they arrived as individuals, they assimilate into
the existing community and must practice according to its customs (SA        <em> </em>YD 214:2; OĤ<em> </em>468:4; MB<em> </em>14). In fact, it is
        possible that most Ashkenazim descend from Sephardic immigrants.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When an entire community migrates, it remains an independent community
        and does not become subsumed into the local community. Its members need
        not change their customs (BHL 468:4). Even if the pre-existing
        community constitutes the majority, as long as the newcomers associate
        as an independent community, they should continue practicing their
        initial customs. This applies to Eretz Yisrael, where, by the grace of
        God, the Ingatherer of scattered Jews, entire communities, led by Torah
        scholars, have migrated in recent centuries. Because they arrived as
        full-fledged communities, they were not assimilated into pre-existing
        communities, so they established synagogues to preserve their customs.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who must pray regularly in a <em>minyan</em> conducted in a
        different <em>nusaĥ</em> – for example, one who moves to a place where
        the only <em>minyan</em> prays in a different <em>nusaĥ</em> – may
        decide how to act. One option is that she prays in the <em>nusaĥ</em>
        of that <em>minyan</em> whenever she prays with it. The second option
        is that she adheres to her ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> while reciting
        those parts of the service that are said aloud in the custom of that
        congregation.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
When one who habitually prays in one <em>nusaĥ</em> attends a        <em>minyan </em>that prays in another <em>nusaĥ</em> on an occasional
        basis, the accepted ruling is that all passages recited aloud are
        prayed in the local <em>nusaĥ</em>, and all silent passages are recited
        in one’s ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
        6:5).

            4. The Status of a Woman who Married a Man from a Different
            Community
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The status of a woman who married a man from a different ethnic
        community is similar to that of one who migrates to a place where local
        custom differs from what he is accustomed to: if he intends to live
        there forever, he must cease practicing his earlier customs and accept
        the local custom (based on SA YD 214:2; OĤ 468:4; MB 14). Likewise, a
        woman who marries a member of a different ethnic community is
        considered to be moving into his home permanently, and she must adopt
        his customs. For instance, if the custom of her husband’s community is
        to eat <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesaĥ, she eats them too, and if it is not
        to eat them, she may not. If they wait six hours between meat and milk,
        she waits six, and if they wait an hour, she waits an hour. As R.
        Shimon b. Tzemaĥ Duran (<em>Tashbetz</em> 3:179) writes, it is
        inconceivable that they regularly eat at the same table, and what is
        permitted to one is forbidden to the other. Therefore, a woman must
        follow her husband’s customs, for one’s wife is like himself. <em></em>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A widow who had a child from her husband continues to follow her late
        husband’s customs. However, if they did not have children, she returns
        to her ancestral customs.
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Similarly, a woman must recite prayers and <em>berakhot</em> according
        to her husband’s <em>nusaĥ</em>, so that there will not be two
        different sets of customs in the same household. However, if it does
not upset her husband, and it is difficult for her to change her<em>nusaĥ</em>, she may continue praying silently in her own        <em>nusaĥ</em>, but she may not pray or recite a <em>berakha </em>aloud
        in a <em>nusaĥ</em> other than that of her husband. When her children
        reach the age of education, she must teach them to pray in her
        husband’s <em>nusaĥ</em>. Therefore, even if her husband agrees that
        she may praying and recite <em>berakhot</em> in the <em>nusaĥ</em> to
        which she is accustomed, when her children reach the age of education
        she should preferably switch to her husband’s <em>nusaĥ</em> so that it
is easier for her to teach her children how to recite prayers and        <em>berakhot</em>.

            5. In What Cases may one Change her <em>Nusaĥ</em>?
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        As we have learned, one must maintain her ancestral custom. The Sages
        based this statement on the verse, "<em>Al titosh torat imekha</em>"
        ("Do not abandon your mother’s teachings"; Mishlei 1:8). However,
        custom is not more important than other laws, and therefore it is
        occasionally superseded. For example, if one knows for certain that she
        will have less <em>kavana</em> praying in a synagogue that conducts
        services in her ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> than in a synagogue where
        services are conducted in a different <em>nusaĥ</em>, she should choose
        the place more conducive to <em>kavana</em>, for this is the essence of
        prayer (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 6 n. 2). However, in a
case of uncertainty, she should preferably pray in her ancestral        <em>nusaĥ,</em> because in the long term it seems that she will have
        more <em>kavana</em> praying in this way. Sometimes young people do not
        properly value their connections to ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> but
        discover deep attachment to it over time and regret having changed it.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one has a choice of two synagogues, one where prayer is conducted in
        her ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> but where there are no Torah classes, and
another that provides Torah study but conducts prayers in a different        <em>nusaĥ</em>, she should evaluate the situation as follows: If she
        estimates that praying in the synagogue with more Torah classes will
        lead her to greater Torah study, it is better that she pray there even
        though the service is not conducted in her ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em>;
        despite the importance of preserving customs, Torah study is of
        paramount importance. Likewise, when choosing a yeshiva or other
learning environment, one should not base the decision on the        <em>nusaĥ</em> of the prayers there. Rather, she should choose the
institution that will best teach her Torah, character, and        <em>mitzvot</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If one has a choice between two synagogues, one where the congregation
        prays in her ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> but where she is concerned that
        she will not be able to connect with its congregants, whether because
        they are too old, too young, too few in number, or any other reason,
        and another where they do not pray in her family’s <em>nusaĥ</em> but
        there is a stronger community where she can better connect to the
        congregants, she must make a judgment. If she feels that praying in the
        latter synagogue will strengthen her connection to the Jewish religious
        community and raise or at least sustain her spiritual level, she should
pray there, even though they do not pray in her ancestral        <em>nusaĥ</em>.

            6. Preserving Customs vs. Strengthening the Community
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In addition to maintaining the <em>nusaĥ</em> of prayer, preservation
        of customs entails upholding traditional pronunciation schemes. Each
        community – Yemenites, Sephardim, and Ashkenazim – pronounces the
        prayers according to its own particular scheme. Indeed, each ethnic
        community should ideally continue to pray with its traditional chants
        (see Rema<em> </em>619:1). Of course, it is allowed to introduce new
        melodies, but the upshot of this ruling is that the main part of the
        prayer should preserve the traditional tune that was sanctified over
        the course of generations. For that reason, one must ideally pray in a
synagogue that uses his ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 6 n. 5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Judaism contains a great variety of different customs. The Sephardic        <em>nusaĥ</em> itself breaks down into numerous different sets of
        customs. Concerning matters of <em>halakha</em>, the key differences
        are between those who follow <em>Shulĥan Arukh </em>and those who
        follow <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>. Moreover, North Africans have their own
        distinct <em>nusaĥ</em> that is quite similar to the Syrian and Iraqi
        rites in terms of <em>halakha </em>and liturgical text but differs
        greatly in terms of the traditional chants and tunes. Even among North
        Africans there are differences in melody. To Moroccans, Algerians sound
        dissonant, and vice versa. To Libyans, both Algerians and Moroccans
        sound off. To perfectly preserve customs, there would need to be
        special synagogues for Libyans, Tunisians, Algerians, and Moroccans in
        addition to those for Iraqi, Syrian, Farsi, Turkish, and Caucasian
        Jews.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Ashkenazim also have a variety of customs. The main difference is
        between Ĥasidim and other Ashkenazim, but there are other significant
        differences in pronunciation and melody between Western Europeans and
        Lithuanians. Regarding pronunciation, there are at least four variants
        from Eastern Europe: those of Greater Hungary, Greater Lithuania,
        Galicia, and Poland. Ĥasidic sects each has distinct customs and
        melodies. Among Yemenites, there are two main liturgical rites: Baladi
        and Shami<em>.</em>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If meticulous preservation of customs will lead to the breakup of the
        community, it is preferable to forgo the preservation of customs. In
        general, when a community is unified, coordinates Torah study for men,
        women, and children, and engages in communal acts of kindness and care,
        it connects all its members to Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>. In contrast,
        when a community is weak, its members lose heart, and this adversely
        affects the children.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Therefore, even though ideally it is best for everyone to follow
        ancestral custom, if doing so requires the establishment of dozens of
        small synagogues that can barely gather a <em>minyan</em> and cannot
        sustain Torah classes, then it is preferable for members of communities
        with similar customs unite to form a stronger community. For example,
        all people from North Africa should pray together, and if that is not
        sufficient, then all who pray in the Sephardic<em> nusaĥ</em> should
        pray together.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is therefore necessary that each locale weigh all the values of
        preserving customs against the value of a strong, solid community. When
        enough families from one ethnic community live in one place and can
        establish a large synagogue while preserving their traditions, all the
        better. But when the numbers are insufficient, it is best that they
        join similar ethnic community to form a strong congregation. If the
        consolidation of similar ethnic communities will not suffice to form a
        strong community, it is best that the members of all communities –
        Sephardim, Ashkenazim, and Yemenites – form a single congregation.
        Sometimes it is necessary to instruct the <em>ĥazan</em> and lead the
        prayers according to his ancestral <em>nusaĥ</em> so that each ethnic
        community is given space. This must be considered with appropriate
        gravitas, and to the local rabbi must render such decisions together
        with the congregation’s leaders (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
        6:9).

            We see a similar principle in the Torah: if a woman who is not from
a family of <em>Kohanim</em> marries a <em>Kohen</em>, she may eat            <em>teruma </em>like a <em>Kohen</em>. If her husband dies and she
            has a child from him, she continues eating <em>teruma</em>. If she
subsequently marries a non-<em>Kohen</em>, she may no longer eat            <em>teruma</em>. <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 1:158 further demonstrates
            that this principle derives from the Torah, as the Torah exempts a
            married woman from the mitzva of honoring her parents since this
            mitzva entails going to dress them and feed them if necessary.
            Since a woman’s obligation to the household she and her husband are
            establishing takes precedence, the Torah exempts her from this
            obligation (SA<em> </em>YD 240:17). Thus, the Torah views a woman’s
            place as her husband’s house. (When there is no clash, a married
            woman has a mitzva honor her parents.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <em>Igrot Moshe </em>
further states that a married woman does need not perform            <em>hatarat nedarim</em> (annulment of vows) in order to take on
            her husband’s customs. This is implicit in MB 468:14 as well, which
            states that since <em>halakha </em>mandates that one who moves from
            one location to another must adopt the practices of the new
community, he does not require <em>hatarat nedarim</em>. So states<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 468:43. Though some say that she requires<em>hatarat nedarim</em> (see <em>Peninei Halakha:</em><em>Pesaĥ</em>, chapter 9 n. 1), in practice, we do not require it,            <em> </em>because when she first started practicing her parents’
            customs, it was clear that if she marries someone from a different
            ethnic community she would adopt his customs. Hence, it was clear
            that she did not intend to follow her parents’ customs all her
            life, as brought by <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em>: Prayer, ch. 1 n. 8.

            As we learned, the prohibition on multiple prayers rites being used
            in one place is intended to avoid disputes. Since the custom of the
            home is determined by the husband, this issue depends on him, and
            he may agree that his wife may continue praying according to her
            ancestral custom. <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em>: Prayer 1:7 states that
            a husband may allow his wife to follow her ancestral customs and
            that it is accepted in many households that the husband agrees that
            his wife continues praying according to her ancestral rite. It
            further states that if a wife follows her ancestral custom at the
            beginning of her marriage and later wishes to switch to her
            husband’s custom, she must perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em>.
            Nevertheless, in matters of <em>kashrut </em>it seems that there
            are no grounds to tolerate divergent customs within a single
            household, as the divergence would be obvious and constitutes a
            violation of "<em>lo titgodedu</em>." Moreover, such practices can
            disturb domestic harmony. I therefore wrote that a woman must not
            pray or recite <em>berakhot </em>aloud in a <em>nusaĥ</em> that
            differs from her husband’s. See <em>Tefila Ke-hilkhata</em>, 4 n.
            4, which states in the name of R. Elyashiv that technically she
            must switch to her husband’s <em>nusaĥ</em>, but she cannot be
            obligated to do so immediately, since she is already accustomed to
            her own <em>nusaĥ</em>. Nevertheless, she must try to switch to her
            husband’s <em>nusaĥ</em> before the children reach the age where
            they begin learning to pray.

            Although these laws primarily pertain to men, who are commanded to
            pray in a synagogue, it is still important for women to know them
            too because often women help their husbands make these decisions.
            These laws also pertain to single women, divorcees, and widows who
            pray in the synagogue.

            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
            6:3 explains that the reason that Ĥasidim switched from the
Ashkenazic <em>nusaĥ </em>to the Ĥasidic <em>nusaĥ </em>known as            <em>Nusaĥ Sepharad</em> was in order to use Arizal’s special
            intentions (<em>kavanot</em>) in their prayers. It also presents
            the view of those who opposed this change. Sections 6 and 7 of that
            chapter discuss one whose parents pray in <em>Nusaĥ Sepharad </em>
            but who has grown accustomed to the Ashkenazic <em>nusaĥ</em>. Must
            they pray in <em>Nusaĥ Sepharad </em>like their parents, or may
            they pray in the familiar Ashkenazic <em>nusaĥ</em>, which was
            indeed the ancestral <em>nusaĥ </em>until 200 years ago? In
            practice, one who is uncertain regarding this matter should ask his
            rabbi. <em>Ibid. </em>8 also explains that Ashkenazim who have
            grown accustomed to praying with the Sephardic pronunciation need
            not return to the Ashkenazic pronunciation according to the
            accepted ruling.

            Additionally, even though ideally everyone should preserve her
            customs and melodies, there is, <em>be-di’avad</em> a positive
            element in the merging of the Diaspora communities. Since one does
            not choose a place to live based on ethnic community, similar
            liturgical rites tend to consolidate. Today most Ashkenazim
            practice that way; people with different traditions pray together.
