    <strong>Editor's Introduction</strong>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The commandment to learn and study the words of the Torah is the most important mitzvah given to the Jewish people (<em>Yerushalmi Peah</em> 1:1;<em>Bavli Moed Katan</em> 9b). This mitzvah obligates us to understand all the fundamentals of the Torah. This is explained by<em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em> (<em>Hilchot Talmud Torah</em> 1:5-7) and summarized in <em>Peninei Halachah</em> (<em>Likutim I</em>,    <em> Hilchot Talmud Torah</em> 3): "The mitzvah to learn Torah requires every Jew to know all the fundamental principles of the Torah so that he will know
    how to act and how to relate to the events of his life according to the Torah's guidance. Indeed, in essence, the Torah knows no bounds. From every letter
    in the Torah it is possible to learn numerous laws and allusions, and in every rabbinic Midrash countless ideas and explanations are concealed. As is
    written (Job 11:9) 'Its measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.' For the root of the Torah lies in eternity, and it is therefore clear
    that there is no limit to the profundity of its ideas. Nevertheless, to the fundamental Torah principles, meaning the written Torah, the halachah (law),
    and its reasons, there are boundaries; it is possible to learn and grasp them."
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    For one learning Torah today, at first glance, this definition seems difficult to comprehend. Is it truly possible for one to know <em>all</em> the
    fundamental principles of the Torah? Hundreds of years ago, when people were engrossed in learning mainly the Bible, Mishnah, and the Talmud, it was
    possible to fulfill this mitzvah, but today, the Torah has become an infinite and endless sea of ideas and details. The following verses of the Torah
    (Deuteronomy 30:11-14), "This mandate that I am prescribing to you today is not too mysterious or remote from you. It is not in heaven... It is something that
    is very close to you. It is in your mouth and in your heart so that you can keep it" seem to refer to aspirations for the future.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Indeed opinions and commentaries on the Torah have multiplied exponentially. The Torah has expanded so much that a person who wishes to truly study a
    certain topic to its fullest is required to learn from many different books, study tens of <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> and then read various
    responsa in order to comprehend and contend with the halachic questions which arise from that topic. As a result, in recent generations, an array of
    halachic books have been written which provide detailed outlines and summarize an entire topic from all its aspects. Each book provides its own advantage;
some are expansive and thoroughly assemble all that is written on the topic, others organize their commentary according to the order of the    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and some are based on meticulously expounding upon the words of the prominent <em>Acharonim</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, the main objective of the commandment to learn Torah - learning all of the fundamentals of the Torah - has become seemingly distant and far from
    reach. The majority of halachic writings today do not emphasize clarifying the principles and general rules that arise from a topic and when a person
    learns from these books alone, the halachic topic may become difficult to grasp. The extensive details seem never-ending and the task of memorizing
    tremendous amounts of minutiae within the halachah seems daunting and almost impossible.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Elucidating the principles and providing halachic clarity are the primary goals of my rabbi and teacher Hagaon HaRav Eliezer Melamed, <em>shlita</em>, in
    his series of books, <em>Peninei Halachah. </em> The aim of this series is to allow the mitzvah of Torah learning to be fulfilled by all and make Torah
    knowledge accessible to every Jew. Each halachah is summarized and concisely reviewed from its source, along with the rationale behind it, so that one may
    review the topic quickly and still encompass the fundamentals of Torah within a short time. Moreover, the books were written to accommodate people on all
    different levels of learning; a person who is not familiar with a topic or halachah can easily understand the books' clear language and grasp the practical
    halachah. At the same time, even one who has learned the <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> on a topic will find the concise halachic summary and
    precise review presented in <em>Peninei Halachah</em> enlightening.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>Peninei Halachah</em>
    is also unique in its approach to halachic rulings from different ethnic groups. In places where the Ashkenazic, Sephardic and Yemenite customs differ, the
    halachah is detailed separately, but in the overall halachic calculation, poskim from all the different ethnic groups are taken into consideration. As Rav
    Melamed explains in the introduction to <em>Peninei Halachah</em> - <em>Berachot</em>, "Although in the past, due to the distance between the Diaspora
    communities, the rabbis took into consideration primarily the rabbis who lived in their surrounding areas, in their generation or in the generations before
    them; today when we live and learn together among the different tribes of Israel, all the <em>poskim</em> from all the ethnic groups must be taken into
    consideration."
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Baruch Hashem, the <em>Peninei Halachah</em> series is being learned by people all over Israel and gaining popularity daily. The books' unique and
    captivating method of teaching halachah has garnered praise and admiration and currently, with God's help, over 200,000 Hebrew copies have been sold. With
    the aim to make <em>Peninei Halachah</em> accessible to more people, it is currently being translated into other languages, among them, French, Czech and
    Braille. This book is the first of the series to be translated into English.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The translation of this book was no small feat. As its name suggests, <em>Peninei Halachah</em> is a halachic work, which necessitates a particularly
    meticulous and accurate translation so that no mistake would be made regarding the practical halachah. At the same time, in <em>Peninei Halachah </em>an
    emphasis is put on a concise synopsis as well as lucidity and flowing language. Much care went into trying to preserve the succinct yet eloquent language
    without sacrificing precision in halachic detail. We hope that we succeeded in providing those who learn this book with the best possible product, although
    it is inevitable that in every translation some of the character and language of the original is diminished or lost. Any and all mistakes in translation
    are the full responsibility of the editor alone and not the author.<em></em>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    First and foremost, I wish to thank Hashem for all the acts of kindness He has bestowed upon me, especially for the tremendous privilege to learn and teach
in the Yeshiva at Har Berachah, enabling me to study <em>Torat Eretz Yisrael</em> and partake in the work of the important and influential books,    <em>Peninei Halachah</em> and their translation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    From the bottom of my heart I am indebted to my Rabbi and teacher Harav Hagaon Rav Eliezer Melamed, <em>shlita</em>, the Rosh yeshiva of Har Berachah and
    the rabbi of the community. It is an enormous privilege to learn from his profound, clear and enlightening teaching. His wonderful vivid writings,
    enjoyable to all who read them, pave the way for learned Torah scholars and laypeople alike to effectively learn the principles of halachah along with
    their spiritual rationale.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Additionally, it is a great privilege to thank my righteous, honest and wise parents, who are constantly engaged in Torah and <em>chessed</em> and in whose
    hearts the love of Torah is deeply entrenched. Above all, I must thank them for their fateful decision to take a giant leap of faith and leave behind the
    earnings and temptations of the Diaspora in order to bring us to the holy land, "the land constantly under God's scrutiny." (Deuteronomy 11:12). Had they
    not done so, it is difficult to imagine where we would be today. Additionally, I must express tremendous gratitude to my parents for instilling within us
    the fundamental principles of ethics, kindness, justice and love of Torah. Today, my family and I still receive tremendous help and support, both spiritual
    and material, from my beloved parents. They were kind enough to take time out from their busy schedules to look over this book and offer important comments
    and clarifications. May it be God's will that they merit seeing grandchildren and great-grandchildren settle in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, engrossed in Torah
    and work for the sake of Heaven.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    I would like to additionally thank my distinguished sister, Atira, who translated this book in its entirety, from the Holy Tongue into the English
    language. She did not spare her time, diligence, thoroughness and effort for all the questions, demands, and requests I made of her in the course of our
    work together. Her incredible work ethic greatly enhanced this book. May it be Hashem's will that she merit raising her five children with her husband,
    Rabbi Yossela, and instill within them Torah, fear of Heaven, integrity and <em>derech eretz</em>, and that they merit seeing their children and
    grandchildren engrossed in <em>Torat Eretz Yisrael</em>. I am honored to thank, as well, our sister Dalit, a full-time doctor, who took the time to
    intensively proofread this book. Her corrections and comments were tremendously helpful.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    I would also like to thank Mrs. Devora Rein and R' Tzvi Fishman who both invested much time in the literary and stylistic editing of this book. Thank you
    as well to R' David Wetzner, Yonatan Heiman, Yaron Cohen, Aharon Freidman and Yitzchak Shilat who proofread the book and made clever comments and
    insightful corrections. Kudos to R' Yonatan Behar, whose original idea it was to translate <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, may he be blessed for setting the
    project in motion. I am also grateful to Rav Yonadav Zar, Yaakov Weinberger, my brother Shalev and all others who were involved in the publication and
    printing of this book. A special thank you goes to my wife, Orit, who devotes her time and energy into raising our children and taking care of our home so
    that I may immerse myself in Torah. Without her, the editing of this book would not have been possible.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    May it be God's will that this translation become an important tool for Torah learning in English and may those who read it grow in their desire to learn,
    meticulously observe and comprehend the halachah, its origins and rationales.

    מצווה מיוחדת נצטווה עם ישראל לקראת כניסתו לארץ, שביום עוברו את הירדן יקים אבנים גדולות ויעשה מהם מזבח, ויכתוב עליהם את כל דברי התורה באר היטב (דברים כז,
    א-ח). ואמרו חכמים שהכוונה לכתוב עליהם את התורה בשבעים לשון (סוטה לב, א). בעוד אנו בחוץ לארץ עיקר מאמצנו מופנים להישרדות, כדי שלא נשכח מהיכן יצאנו ולהיכן
    נשוב. אולם בארץ ישראל אנו צריכים לזכור שתפקידנו הוא להאיר את העולם כולו, ולכן עלינו לכתוב את התורה בשבעים לשון, כדי שתתבאר היטב בכל הבחינות ותאיר לכל
    העמים. יהי רצון שתרגום "פניני הלכה" יהיה נדבך בגילוי הארת התורה לעולם.

    בראש ובראשונה ספר זה מוקדש לכל היהודים הצדיקים שוויתרו על מגוריהם בארצות השפע, על מעמד וממון, ועלו לארץ זבת חלב ודבש, ארץ התורה והנבואה, ארץ הקודש והמקדש,
    ארץ אשר אבניה ברזל, ומלחמות קשות, מפנים ומאחור, נדרשות כדי להתיישב בה. השפה האנגלית היתה שגורה על פיהם, שפה בינלאומית שפתחה לפניהם שערים בכל העולם, ועלו
    לארץ אבותינו, לדבר בשפתנו הקדושה והעתיקה. מאנשים שידעו להתבטא ברהיטות, בדייקנות וברגש, הפכו לעלגי לשון שצריכים לעיתים את עזרת ילדיהם כדי להסתדר בארץ. ומי
    יודע אם אנו, שאבותינו נולדו בארץ, היינו יכולים לעלות בהר ה' כמותם. זכות גדולה נפלה בחלקם של המתרגמים 'פניני הלכה' לאנגלית, לסייע לאנשים היקרים והצדיקים
    הללו ללמוד דברי תורה מתורת ארץ ישראל בנחת ובנעימות, בשפה השגורה על לשונם.
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
    ספר זה גם מוקדש לכל היהודים האהובים שעוד נותרו בגלות, שהננו מתפללים ומקווים לעלייתם לארץ במהרה. תפקיד חשוב נועד ליהודי אמריקה, יהדות זו שגילתה כשרונות
    עצומים ומגוונים, ובחריצות אין קץ הצליחה לתרום תרומה מכרעת להעלאתה של ארצות הברית למעמדה הנכבד כיום, אם יתקשרו בכל אותם הכשרונות והחריצות למורשת אבות, וליבם
    ומוחם יהיה נתון ליעוד המיוחד של עמנו, יוכלו להאיר את העולם באור התורה, לרפאו מחוליו ולהחיש את גאולתו. הכשרון העצום שגילו בתחומים השונים, והתרבות העולמית
    והשפה האנגלית השגורה על פיהם, יהיו כלים חשובים לתיקון עולם. ואותם הצדיקים שעלו לארץ ומדברים עברית במבטא המיוחד, העדין והמתוק שלהם, מבשרים כי הנה קרבה
    גאולתנו.

    צדקה עשה ה' עמי שהרב מאור קיים שליט"א, הגיע לישיבת הר ברכה והוא הולך ומתעלה ומתגדל בתורה עד שכבר נעשה מורה הוראה. אחריו בא לישיבה אחיו שלו, ומתוך כך זכיתי
    להכיר את הוריהם, ד"ר רפאל וד"ר אביבה, שקיימו את מצוות ישוב הארץ למהדרין. הם הסכימו לוותר על הקליניקה המצליחה שהיתה לד"ר רפאל בניו-יורק ועלו אל העתיד הלא
    ידוע בארץ. בעזרת ה' במשך הזמן שניהם הסתדרו על הצד היותר טוב, ד"ר אביבה עוסקת ביעוץ וד"ר רפאל הינו רופא מחוזי בירושלים והסביבה. כאן המקום להודות לו על הסיוע
    שהוא מעניק לי בשאלות הלכתיות הנוגעות לרפואה.
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
    את שבת החתן של הרב מאור עשתה משפחת קיים בהר ברכה שבלב השומרון, בסעודת השבת אמר לי ד"ר רפאל, שהוא מרגיש בארץ ישראל כמו בגן עדן. דקות ספורות לאחר הבדלה תקף
    מחבל ביריות את בני המשפחה, דלית בתם, שהיתה בהריון ספגה ששה כדורים, בעלה יעקב ספג שלושה כדורים. אחד מבני משפחת הכלה יחד עם אחד מבוגרי הישיבה חיסלו את המחבל.
    סכנת חיים נשקפה לדלית. כשבאתי לבקרם בבית החולים, שאלתי את ד"ר רפאל, שלא עזב את בית החולים עד לשחרורה של בתו, אם הוא עדיין מרגיש בגן עדן, והוא התעקש שאכן
    כך, ארץ ישראל היא כמו גן עדן. בחסדי ה' דלית נרפאה לגמרי, העובר נולד בשעה טובה. היא כיום אם לארבעה ומשמשת כרופאה בירושלים.
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
    ועתה הרב מאור קיים נטל על עצמו לערוך את תרגום 'פניני הלכה' לאנגלית. עתירה, אחותו הבכורה, תוך גידול ילדיה הקטנים, עסקה בתרגום הספר. גברת דבורה ריין, אמו של
    חנן תלמיד ישיבתנו, ור' צבי פישמן ערכו את הספר, לשונית וסגנונית, והרב מאור פיקח על הצד ההלכתי. לכולם הנני מודה מעומק לבי. ויהי רצון שדברי התורה הללו יאירו
    ויתקיימו בלבבם של הלומדים בספר, ומתוך כך נזכה להתפלל כראוי לפני אבינו שבשמיים, ונזכה לכל הברכות הכתובות בתורה, ונזכה לגאולה שלימה במהרה בימינו.
