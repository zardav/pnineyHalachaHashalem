<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="1"></a><h2>1. <em>Zakhor</em> and <em>Shamor</em></h2>
<p>As we have seen above (1:8), there are two crucial <em>mitzvot</em> that form the backbone of Shabbat: <em>Zakhor</em> and <em>Shamor</em>.</p>
<p><em>Shamor</em> instructs us to refrain from all labor. In this way we clear space in our soul, which we are commanded to fill with positive content. This positive content is included in <em>Zakhor</em>, which instructs us to remember the holiness of Shabbat and use it to connect with the foundations of our faith. For six days we are active in the outside world; on Shabbat we return to our inner world, to our soul, and remind ourselves once again of the fundamentals of faith.</p>
<p>The first fundamental that we recall during <em>kiddush</em> is the creation of the world, and the second is the Exodus from Egypt. There are some who concede that God created the world but do not believe that even following creation, God remains responsible for the ongoing existence of the world, which He supervises and manages. At the time of the Exodus, God&rsquo;s divine providence was very clearly revealed, in a way that made it clear that God reveals Himself to the world by way of the Jewish people. This is the significance of the second foundational belief that we mention in <em>kiddush</em>.</p>
<p>These two foundational beliefs are mentioned in the Torah&rsquo;s two versions of the Ten Commandments. In Shemot we are commanded to remember the creation of the world: &ldquo;Commemorate the day of Shabbat to sanctify it&hellip;. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed Shabbat day and hallowed it&rdquo; (Shemot 20:8, 11). However, the mitzva is formulated with the word &ldquo;<em>shamor</em>&rdquo; in Devarim, and there the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned: &ldquo;Observe the day of Shabbat to sanctify it&hellip;for you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God freed you from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the day of Shabbat&rdquo; (Devarim 5:12, 15). In truth, there is a connection between Shabbat and the Exodus from Egypt, for they both reveal the divine soul, which brings about our freedom from enslavement &ndash; whether to Egypt or to work.</p>
<p>We fulfill the essence of <em>Zakhor</em> when we recite <em>kiddush</em> over wine, thereby sanctifying the whole day, as it is written: &ldquo;Commemorate the day of Shabbat to sanctify it&rdquo; (Shemot 20:8) &ndash; the entire day should be sanctified and set aside for reviewing foundational beliefs and studying Torah while eating pleasurable meals and sleeping soundly. Even during the week there is a mitzva to remember Shabbat and sanctify it, meaning it should be honored more than other days. One should prepare for it by making food, laundering, bathing, and cleaning one&rsquo;s home (See Ramban, Shemot 20:7; above 2:1-6).</p>
<p>Both men and women are obligated in the <em>mitzvot</em> of Shabbat. Although women are generally exempt from time-bound positive commandments, and <em>Zakhor</em> is such a mitzva, women are nevertheless obligated because <em>Zakhor</em> and <em>Shamor</em> were proclaimed together; they are intertwined. Just as women are obligated in the <em>mitzvot</em> derived from <em>Shamor</em> &ndash; the negative commandments, so too they are obligated in the <em>mitzvot</em> derived from <em>Zakhor</em> &ndash; the positive commandments.</p>
<p>Therefore, men and women are equally obligated in Shabbat <em>mitzvot</em>, and a woman may recite <em>kiddush</em> for a man and exempt him from his obligation. But minors who have not yet reached bat or bar mitzva cannot exempt adults, because even children who are old enough to understand what Shabbat is about are still only obligated rabbinically in <em>kiddush</em>, whereas adults have a Torah obligation (SA 271:2).</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>2. Fulfilling the Mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em></h2>
<p>One fulfills the Torah obligation of <em>Zakhor</em> by invoking the sanctity of Shabbat and specifying that it commemorates the creation of the world and the Exodus from Egypt. However, the Sages wished for everyone to fulfill this mitzva using a precise and perfect text, so the Men of the Great Assembly formulated a <em>berakha</em> that declares the sanctity of Shabbat. To ensure that <em>kiddush</em> would be both dignified and pleasurable, they mandated that it be recited over a cup of wine prior to a meal. Some maintain that the Torah requires that <em>kiddush</em> be recited over enjoyable food or drink. <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button> It is customary to recite the additional verses of <em>Va-yekhulu</em> (Bereishit 2:1-3) before <em>kiddush</em> (see above 5:12).</p>
<p>Many <em>poskim</em> maintain that <em>Zakhor</em> obligates us to mark the end of Shabbat as well as its beginning. With the onset of Shabbat, there is a mitzva to invoke its sanctity and essence, while when it ends there is a mitzva to identify the difference between the sacred Shabbat and the mundane weekdays. Therefore, according to many <em>poskim</em>, <em>havdala</em>, recited at the end of Shabbat, is a Torah obligation. Like <em>kiddush</em>, this Torah obligation can be fulfilled with words alone, while the Sages ordained that it be said over a cup of wine (Rambam; MB 296:1; see below 8:1).</p>
<p>The Sages mandated that <em>kiddush</em> be recited on Shabbat day as well, to honor the day and differentiate it from weekdays. By beginning the meal with <em>kiddush</em>, we make it clear that this is a special and important meal; thus we are reminded of the sanctity of Shabbat. However, since this is not the primary fulfillment of <em>Zakhor</em>, the Sages did not formulate a special <em>berakha</em> in honor of Shabbat. Rather the <em>berakha</em> on wine (<em>Ha-gafen</em>) is recited over a cup of wine. The custom is to say a few Shabbat-related verses beforehand. This <em>kiddush</em> is referred to as &ldquo; <em>Kidusha Raba</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Great <em>Kiddush</em>&rdquo;), which is a type of euphemism, as in fact it is the Friday night <em>kiddush</em> that is the important one (MB 289:3).</p>
<p>Even though the meal eaten on Shabbat day is considered more important than the nighttime meal (as explained below, 7:4), the mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em> is nevertheless fulfilled though the <em>kiddush</em> at night, because the mitzva is to mark Shabbat as it begins. Thus, after one finishes praying, he should hasten to make <em>kiddush</em> (SA 271:1, 3). One who was unable to make <em>kiddush</em> Friday night has not lost out on the mitzva. Rather, he should make <em>kiddush</em> in the morning before eating his first meal. He should recite the Friday night <em>kiddush</em> but leave out the verses of <em>Va-yekhulu</em>, since they are specifically connected to the evening (SA and Rema 271:8). If he did not make <em>kiddush</em> before his meal in the morning, there is still a mitzva to make <em>kiddush</em> as long as the sun has not set. He should make sure to eat afterward (as will be explained below, section 10).</p>
<p>Since according to Torah law one can verbally fulfill the obligation of<em>Zakhor</em>, some maintain that with the recitation of the middle <em>berakha</em> of the <em>Amida </em>at <em>Ma&rsquo;ariv </em>(which invokes Shabbat), one has already fulfilled this obligation (MA). However, others question this, for two reasons. First, people do not generally intend to fulfill the mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em> with this prayer, and we maintain that <em>mitzvot</em> require intent (SA 60:4). Second, it is possible that one must mention in <em>kiddush</em> that Shabbat is a commemoration of the Egyptian Exodus. In the <em>Amida</em>, the Exodus is not juxtaposed with the sanctity of Shabbat. Therefore, in practice, we fulfill the Torah commandment in accordance with the Sages&rsquo; directives by making <em>kiddush</em> over wine (MB 271:2; BHL <em>ad loc</em>.). Furthermore, we have already seen that some authorities maintain that fulfilling the Torah obligation requires wine (see n. 1).</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>3. <em>Kiddush</em> over Wine</h2>
<p>The Sages instituted the recitation of <em>kiddush</em> over wine because it is the most dignified beverage, as it provides both nourishment and good cheer. They similarly instituted that a<em>berakha</em> be recited over a cup of wine at other joyful<em>mitzvot</em>, such as betrothal, weddings (when seven blessings &ndash; <em>Sheva Berakhot </em>&ndash; are recited), and <em>brit mila</em>. The special status of wine is also expressed in the fact that a special <em>berakha </em>was instituted for it. Before drinking most beverages, we recite the general <em>berakha</em> of <em>She-hakol</em>, and after finishing the drink we recite the short <em>berakha aĥarona</em>,<em>Borei Nefashot</em>. When it comes to wine, however, we recite <em>Ha-gafen </em>before drinking and <em>Al Ha-gefen</em> afterward. Another law gives expression to the special status of wine. Although its <em>berakha</em> is different from that of other drinks, reciting<em>Ha-gafen</em> over wine exempts the person drinking from making <em>berakhot</em> over any other drinks.</p>
<p>Ideally, in order to glorify the mitzva, <em>kiddush</em> should be made over a fine wine, one the person making <em>kiddush</em> really enjoys. If wine is unavailable, one should make <em>kiddush</em> over bread on Friday night and over an alcoholic beverage such as beer or vodka on Shabbat day. If no such drink is available, he may make <em>kiddush</em> over bread during the day as well. <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button></p>
<p>The recitation of <em>kiddush</em> over wine has profound significance. Generally, holiness comes to expression in the spiritual world in a somber and serious fashion, while in the material world, the evil inclinations toward lust, arrogance, and mockery are more evident. Therefore, gentile spiritual leaders often distance themselves from joy and jubilation, as they are likely to entice one toward despicable physical desires. This is not the case for Jews. We sanctify Shabbat with wine to express the holiness of Shabbat, which reveals itself in both the spiritual and material worlds. Joy and jubilation, when properly directed, can be our true partners in revealing holiness in the world. This is the point of Shabbat &ndash; to reveal holiness through Torah study as well as festive meals, through prayer as well as <em>kiddush</em> over wine. This accords with the statement of the Sages: &ldquo;One who recites <em>kiddush</em> over wine on Friday night is granted long life in this world and in the World to Come&rdquo; ( <em>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</em> 19).</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>4. Acceptable <em>Kiddush</em> Wines</h2>
<p>The laws of acceptable <em>kiddush</em> wines are derived from the laws governing which wines could be used on the altar in Temple times. Any wine that was deemed unacceptable because of its repulsiveness is also <em>pasul</em> (ritually unfit) for <em>kiddush</em>. For example, wine that was left exposed for several hours in a cup or an open bottle may not be used for <em>kiddush</em>. Similarly, wine that smells bad is unacceptable (SA 272:1; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 3).</p>
<p>However, wines acceptable only <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em> for use on the altar are acceptable for <em>kiddush</em> even <em>le-khatĥila</em>. For example, a very sweet wine, made from overripe grapes overexposed to sunlight, is acceptable on the altar <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em> but acceptable for <em>kiddush</em> even <em>le-khatĥila</em>. Similarly, using grape juice on the altar was deemed acceptable <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em> but may be used for <em>kiddush</em> <em>le-khatĥila</em>. Nevertheless, it is most preferable to make <em>kiddush</em> on good alcoholic wine that makes one glad (SA 272:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 5).</p>
<p>Some wines have been rendered unfit for the altar because they have been mixed with other liquids, but are still acceptable for <em>kiddush</em>. For example, wine mixed with water is <em>pasul</em> for the altar, but not for <em>kiddush</em>. On the contrary, it is good to dilute the wine a bit to make it tastier, and to dull its strength. Nowadays, however, wines do not need to be watered down, because they are not strong to begin with (SA and Rema 272:5).</p>
<p>Some maintain that if wine is so watered down that there is more water than wine, it is not considered wine, the <em>berakha</em> recited over it is not <em>Ha-gafen</em>, and it is unacceptable for <em>kiddush</em>. Others are more lenient and permit its use as long as it still tastes like wine. Local Israeli rabbinates make sure to only certify wines in which wine content is the majority, thus satisfying all opinions. <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button></p>
<p>Wine that was cooked (&ldquo;<em>mevushal</em>&rdquo;) or had sugar or honey added to it was rendered unacceptable for Temple libations because it had been altered from its original form. Some maintain that just as these wines were unacceptable for libations, so too they are unacceptable for <em>kiddush</em> (Rambam). But the majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that these wines are acceptable for <em>kiddush</em> because cooking them or adding sugar to them is meant to improve them, and this is the accepted practice. Even if one has unadulterated wine but prefers the taste of the cooked or sweetened wine, it is preferable to make <em>kiddush</em> over the wine he prefers (SA and Rema 272:8). Many choice sweet wines have no sugar added, but rather are sweet because of the type of grape used to make them. Everyone agrees that these wines are acceptable for <em>kiddush</em> use. <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button></p>
<p>Some maintain that only red wine is acceptable for <em>kiddush</em> use, while white wine is unfit (Ramban). However, most <em>poskim</em> maintain that white wine may be used, and this is the position of <em>Shulĥan Arukh</em> (272:4). If one has two wines available to him &ndash; an inferior red and a superior white &ndash; and he wishes to conform to all the positions, he should mix the white wine with a little of the red, which will leave him with tasty red wine (it is preferable to pour the white wine into the red, as explained below, 12:10).</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>5. The Required Amount of Wine</h2>
<p>In order to fulfill the mitzva of <em>kiddush</em> there must be enough wine in the cup to be considered significant, so that the <em>berakha</em> is recited over something. This amount is the volume of an egg and a half (one fourth [<em>revi&rsquo;it</em>] of a <em>log</em>, commonly referred to simply as a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em>), which is the minimum amount that must be present in any cup being used to fulfill a mitzva (<em>kos shel berakha</em>). If less than this amount is used, the mitzva has not been fulfilled (<em>Shabbat</em> 76b; <em>Pesaĥim</em> 107a, 108b; MA 271:32).</p>
<p>For many years it was assumed that the egg and a half that Rambam mentions was the equivalent of 86 ml, based on the opinion of R. Ĥayim Naeh. However, more precise calculations show that the amount is really 75 ml. Some are stringent and maintain that the eggs nowadays are only half the size that they once were, so that the amount of wine in the cup must be doubled to 150 ml. (<em>Ĥazon Ish</em>). In practice, the bottom line is that one may make <em>kiddush</em> over 75 ml of wine, but many Ashkenazim are stringent <em>le-khatĥila</em> to use 150 ml. <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button></p>
<p>After making <em>kiddush</em>, one must drink a &ldquo;<em>melo lugmav</em>&rdquo; &ndash; the amount of wine that could fill the drinker&rsquo;s cheek if he puffed it out &ndash; considered the smallest amount that has a relaxing effect on the drinker. This corresponds to the majority of a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em>, or at least 38 ml, but one with a bigger mouth must drink more. For most people this amount will be between 50 and 55 ml, but nobody, even a giant, must drink more than a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em>.</p>
<p>If the person making <em>kiddush</em> is unable to drink a<em>melo lugmav</em>, one of the listeners can do so instead. <em>Be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, if a cheek full is drunk collectively, all have fulfilled their obligation, even though no individual drank a cheek full (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 107a; SA 271:14; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 73). <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button></p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>6. The Laws of <em>Kos Shel Berakha</em></h2>
<p>The Sages ordained that a number of <em>berakhot</em> be recited over a <em>kos </em>(goblet) of wine, such as the <em>berakha</em> over betrothal, marriage, <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> (Grace after Meals), <em>kiddush</em>, and <em>havdala</em>. Since these <em>berakhot</em> are made over a <em>kos</em> to glorify God, it is proper that the <em>kos</em> be pretty and elegant. The Sages established the following rules about it<em>.</em></p>
<p>The <em>kos</em> must be whole, without defects or breaks on the rim or the base. If the <em>kos</em> is not whole, but no other <em>kos</em> is available, one may still use it <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em>. However, if it is cracked to the point that the wine leaks out, leaving less than a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em>, it may not be used.</p>
<p>If there are several available cups, one should pick out the nicest one to use for the <em>berakha</em>. Many use a silver goblet for <em>kiddush</em>. If the only <em>kos</em> available is a plastic disposable one, it may be used <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em>. <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button></p>
<p>The <em>kos</em> must be totally clean. If it was drunk from or otherwise got dirty, it must be washed inside and out (SA 183:1). <em>Be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, if it is difficult to wash the <em>kos</em>, one may wipe it out and clean it using a napkin (MB <em>ad loc.</em> 1).</p>
<p>Although a <em>kos</em> that holds a<em> revi&rsquo;it</em> is sufficient, if a larger cup is used, there is a mitzva to fill it up all the way since it is more dignified for the <em>berakha</em> to be made over a full cup. Some are accustomed to fill the <em>kos</em> to overflowing, to the point that whoever is making <em>kiddush</em> will probably spill wine on his hand. It would seem preferable to fill the <em>kos</em> close to the top but not to overflowing, so that the wine does not spill. This is what the Sages meant when they spoke of a full <em>kos</em> (<em>Taz</em> 183:4; SAH 4; MB 183:9; proof of this is the explanation given of Beit Hillel&rsquo;s opinion in <em>Berakhot</em> 52b).</p>
<p>If one drank from the wine while it was in the <em>kos</em> or directly from the wine bottle, the wine remaining in the <em>kos</em> or bottle is called <em>pagum</em> (defective) and considered unfit for sacramental purposes. When necessary, one can fix <em>pagum</em> wine by adding non-defective wine to it. Once the additional wine is added, all the wine is considered new. If the wine is strong, one can fix it by adding water instead. <em>Be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, if there is no way to fix the wine, one may make <em>kiddush</em> on <em>pagum</em> wine (SA 182:3-7). <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button></p>
<p>The Sages stated that one should first take the <em>kos</em> in both hands in order to show how dear it is. Then, when making <em>kiddush</em>, one should hold the <em>kos</em> in the right hand, which is the more important one. He should hold the <em>kos</em> with all his fingers so that they cradle the cup. He should lift the <em>kos</em> a <em>tefaĥ </em>above the table, so that it is visible to all. He should look at the <em>kos</em> so that he is not distracted. If he needs to, he should look in a prayer book, but it is best to place it adjacent to the <em>kos </em>so that he sees both. After he drinks from the wine he should give some to his wife so that the blessing spreads to both of them (SA 183:4). <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button></p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>7. Distributing Wine to All Present</h2>
<p>In order to fulfill the mitzva of <em>kiddush</em>, a<em>melo lugmav </em>of wine must be drunk by the person making <em>kiddush</em> or a member of his audience (as explained in section 5 of this chapter). The rest of the listeners thus fulfill their obligation in <em>kiddush</em> even if they do not partake of the wine. Ideally, each listener should drink from the <em>kiddush</em> wine (SA 271:14).</p>
<p>If the person who made <em>kiddush</em> drank directly from the <em>kos</em>, he should not then pour from this <em>kos</em> into cups for the listeners, since the wine is now <em>pagum</em> (as we learned in section 6). However, as long as family members are drinking directly from the <em>kiddush</em> cup they are not considered drinking <em>pagum</em> wine, because their drinking is considered an extension of the original drinking. It is only when the wine is poured into a different cup that it is considered <em>pagum</em> (SHT 271:89; MB 182:24).</p>
<p>Thus, one who wishes to pour the <em>kiddush</em> wine into the cups of his audience should first add a little wine from the bottle to the <em>kos</em>. This fixes the cup&rsquo;s wine, and it may then be poured for the other people present (SA 182:6; MB 271:82; SHT 271:89). Another solution is for the person making <em>kiddush</em> to pour a <em>melo lugmav </em>from the <em>kiddush</em> cup into his own cup, and drink the wine from there. This way the wine in the <em>kiddush</em> cup is not <em>pagum</em>, and he may pour from it into the cups of the listeners. It is often necessary to add wine to the <em>kiddush</em> cup so that everyone who listened to <em>kiddush</em> can have a taste.</p>
<p>There is another method: Before making <em>kiddush</em>, a little wine can be poured into the cups of all present. After hearing <em>kiddush</em> they can drink this wine. In this case, the person making <em>kiddush</em> need not pour wine for them from his<em>kos</em> at all, since the wine before them at the time of <em>kiddush</em> is considered <em>kiddush</em> wine. There are two advantages to this: 1) The audience&rsquo;s time lag between making the <em>berakha</em> and drinking the wine is shortened. 2) There is no issue of <em>pagum</em> at all. This is particularly suitable for a large audience and for guests who may feel uncomfortable drinking wine poured from the cup that the person making <em>kiddush</em> drank from (SA 271:16-17; MB 83). If the listeners do not have a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em> of wine in their cups, they should not drink until after the person making <em>kiddush</em> drinks (SSK ch. 48 n. 74).</p>
<p>Even if the listeners do not plan to drink from the wine, they should still remain silent until the one making <em>kiddush</em> has drunk a <em>melo lugmav</em>. <em>Be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, if they spoke before he drank, they have still fulfilled their obligation (SSK 48:6). If they wish to drink the wine, they should remain silent until after drinking. <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button></p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>8. <em>Kiddush </em>Customs and Covering the Challah</h2>
<p>There is a widespread custom to stand during the Friday night <em>kiddush</em> because it attests to the creation of the world, and witnesses must stand when giving testimony. The Arizal, basing himself on mystical considerations, also recommends standing; this is the custom of Sephardim and Ashkenazic Ĥasidim (SA 271:10;<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 62). However, most Ashkenazic Jews sit during <em>kiddush</em> since it is supposed to be recited where one will be eating (see section 10 below), and meals are eaten sitting down. Additionally, sitting down together makes the audience and the person making <em>kiddush</em> into a clearly-defined group. There are some Ashkenazim who try to get the best of both worlds by standing during the recitation of <em>Va-yekhulu</em> and sitting down for the rest of <em>kiddush</em> (MB 271:46; SSK 47:28).</p>
<p>All agree that it is preferable to sit for <em>kiddush</em> during the day, and this is the common practice. Nevertheless, some are accustomed to stand, and this is not prohibited.</p>
<p>Even though a woman may make <em>kiddush</em> like a man, it is customary for the man to make <em>kiddush</em> for his family. When multiple families are eating together it is preferable that one person make <em>kiddush</em> for everyone, based on the principle that &ldquo;In a multitude of people, the King is glorified&rdquo; (SA 167:11).</p>
<p>It is customary to cover the challah during <em>kiddush</em>. Since bread is considered the more important food, normally if we have both wine and bread in front of us and we plan to eat from both, we recite the <em>berakha</em> on the bread first. But when making <em>kiddush</em>, the <em>berakha</em> on the wine must be made first. In order to avoid giving &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; precedence to the wine, we cover the challah. Similarly, if there are <em>mezonot </em>(grain-based foods over which the <em>berakha </em>of <em>Mezonot</em> is recited), they should be covered during <em>kiddush</em>, as <em>mezonot</em> also normally take precedence over wine. When one is organizing a <em>kiddush</em> for the congregation after services, anyone intending to drink from the <em>kiddush</em> wine must cover any pastries in front of him. One who does not intend to drink from the wine after <em>kiddush</em> need not do so (See SSK ch. 47 n. 125). Based on this explanation, it is not necessary to have the challah on the table when one is making <em>kiddush</em>. If they are on the table, however, they must be covered.</p>
<p>Others provide an additional reason for covering the challah. The two Shabbat challahs allude to the manna that fell during desert times. The manna was covered above and below by layers of dew. To parallel this, the challah is placed above the tablecloth and covered. Accordingly, some people are careful to put the covered challah on the table before <em>kiddush</em>, as a reminder of the manna. Some leave the challah covered until after the recitation of &ldquo;<em>ha-motzi</em>.&rdquo; Some even cover the challah at <em>se&rsquo;uda shlishit</em> for this reason (MB 271:41; AHS 271:22).</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>9. The Prohibition of Eating and Drinking before <em>Kiddush</em></h2>
<p>Once Shabbat has begun, it is a mitzva to fulfill the Torah mandate of <em>Zakhor</em> as soon as possible by making <em>kiddush</em>. The Sages ordained that nothing should be eaten before <em>kiddush</em>. One may not even drink water before <em>kiddush</em>, but one may rinse his mouth out or swallow medicine (SA 271:4; MB 271:13; SSK 52:3). <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button></p>
<p>This prohibition goes into effect from the moment Shabbat begins. Therefore, a woman who lights candles and accepts Shabbat may not drink until she hears <em>kiddush</em>. Similarly, a man who has accepted<em>tosefet</em> <em>Shabbat</em> may not eat or drink until he hears<em>kiddush</em>. Even one who has not fulfilled the mitzva of <em>tosefet</em> <em>Shabbat</em> may not eat after <em>shki&rsquo;a,</em> because Shabbat begins then whether or not one consciously accepts it (MB 271:11; see SSK 43:46).</p>
<p>On Shabbat day as well, after <em>Shaĥarit </em>it is forbidden to eat or drink until one hears <em>kiddush</em>.</p>
<p>Some wish to eat and drink before <em>Shaĥarit</em>, but, as is generally known, this is forbidden. The Sages tell us: &ldquo;If one eats and drinks, and only afterward prays, Scripture says of him: &lsquo;You have cast Me behind your back [Hebrew &ldquo;<em>gavekha</em>&rdquo;]&rsquo; (1 Melakhim 14:9). Do not read <em>gavekha</em> (your back), but rather <em>ge&rsquo;ekha</em> (your pride). God says: &lsquo;After this one has exalted himself, he comes and accepts the kingdom of heaven?!&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Berakhot</em> 10b). However one may drink water before praying because there is no pride in drinking water. The <em>poskim</em> also teach that if one needs to he may also drink coffee or tea; and if he must, he may even sweeten it with a bit of sugar (SA 89:3-4).</p>
<p>If one is sick and must eat before praying, or is so hungry that he knows he will not be able to focus on his prayers if he does not eat something before praying, he may eat a little (see <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Prayer</em> 12:6-7). Although some maintain that he should make <em>kiddush</em> before eating, in practice we do not make <em>kiddush</em> before prayer, because the custom follows the opinion that it is only after <em>Shaĥarit</em> that the obligation of <em>kiddush</em> comes into effect. <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button></p>
<p>A woman who generally prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> may drink before praying, and, if need be, even eat (as may a man), for as long as she has not prayed, she is not yet obligated in <em>kiddush</em>. But a woman who generally only prays <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> is obligated in <em>kiddush</em> immediately upon awakening. If she wishes to eat or drink, she should first say <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and then make <em>kiddush</em> and eat and drink. In a case of necessity, such as if she does not know how to make <em>kiddush</em> and is very thirsty, she may drink, and &ndash; if really necessary &ndash; even eat ( <em>Peninei Halakha</em>:<em> Women&rsquo;s Prayer</em> 22:10). <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button></p>
<p>If minors are old enough to be taught, ideally they should be trained not to eat before <em>kiddush</em>, but if they are hungry or thirsty one may feed them before <em>kiddush</em> (SSK 52:18; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 271:17).</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>10. Reciting <em>Kiddush</em> at the Place of the Meal</h2>
<p>The Sages ordained that <em>kiddush</em> be made at the place of the meal (&ldquo;<em>be-makom se&rsquo;uda</em>&rdquo;), for Scripture states: &ldquo;Call Shabbat &lsquo;delight&rsquo;&rdquo; (Yeshayahu 58:13), teaching us that specifically where one delights in Shabbat with bread or pastries he must proclaim Shabbat, i.e., make <em>kiddush</em>. This allows us to reveal the special nature of Shabbat, whose meals are a direct continuation of the mitzva of <em>Zakhor</em>. The proclamation of holiness and the delight with meals complement each other. If one did not eat where he made<em>kiddush</em>, he did not fulfill the mitzva, and he must make<em>kiddush</em> again where he eats. This law applies equally to <em>kiddush</em> by day and by night.</p>
<p>There were some Torah giants who were personally stringent, and insisted on eating their actual Shabbat meal where they made <em>kiddush</em>. This was the custom of the Vilna Gaon. However, the law requires only that one eat a <em>kezayit</em> of bread or <em>mezonot</em> where one makes <em>kiddush</em>. This is sufficient to fulfill the obligation of <em>kiddush</em>. Afterward, one may eat the meal elsewhere. According to the Ge&rsquo;onim, if there is no <em>mezonot</em> food where one is making <em>kiddush</em>, he may drink a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em> of wine instead, since wine is also nutritious and filling. If necessary, one may rely upon them. However, at night when the obligation of <em>kiddush</em> is of Torah origin, the person making <em>kiddush</em> should be careful to drink a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em> in addition to the <em>melo lugmav </em>that he must drink to fulfill the obligation of <em>kiddush</em>. The rest of the listeners need only drink a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em> (SA 273:5; MB 273:25, 27; SHT 29).</p>
<p>However, if one heard <em>kiddush</em> at the synagogue but only drank a bit of juice and had less than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>mezonot</em> , he has not fulfilled his obligation of <em>kiddush</em>. Not only that, but he has transgressed the rabbinic prohibition against eating and drinking before <em>kiddush</em>; for since he did not fulfill his obligation, it turns out that he ate and drank before <em>kiddush</em>.</p>
<p>The Rishonim discuss three different parameters for how far away one may go and still be considered eating &ldquo;at the place of the meal&rdquo;:</p>
<p>1) Anywhere within the same room is acceptable, even if one place is not visible to another in the same room (Rambam; <em>Tosafot</em>; Rosh).</p>
<p>2) As long as the person making <em>kiddush</em> can see the place where the meal will be eaten, even if that place is in a different home or yard, it is acceptable (R. Sar Shalom).</p>
<p>3) If, while making <em>kiddush</em>, the person had in mind to move to another room in the same building, it is acceptable (R. Nissim Gaon).</p>
<p>Ideally, one should make <em>kiddush</em> at the actual place of the meal. When this is difficult, one may make <em>kiddush</em> anywhere that two of the three criteria mentioned above are met. For example, if one needs to eat in a different room, it is preferable that he have that in mind during <em>kiddush</em>, and that he make <em>kiddush</em> from a vantage point where he can see the place where he is planning to eat. If there is really no choice, one can rely on any one of the three criteria being met (SA 273:1; MB and SHT<em> ad loc.</em>).</p>
<p>Ideally, one should not wait between making <em>kiddush</em> and eating. Similarly, one should not go somewhere after <em>kiddush</em> before eating, even if he intends to return and eat where he made <em>kiddush</em>. <em>Be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, if he waited for a short time or left briefly, his <em>kiddush</em> still counts. However, if he waited more than 72 minutes and intended to separate <em>kiddush </em>and the meal, then he has &ldquo;lost&rdquo; his <em>kiddush</em> and he must make it again (Rema 273:3; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 12; BHL s.v. &ldquo;le-altar&rdquo;; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> <em>ad loc</em>. 29; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 11:26; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 273:15; SSK 54, nn. 46-47).</p>

According to Rambam (MT 29:6), Rabbeinu Tam, <em>Smag</em>, Rashba, and the vast majority of <em>poskim</em>, the mitzva to make <em>kiddush</em> over wine is rabbinic, and the verse is merely a support. However, according to Rashi and the Ran (commenting on Rif, <em>Shabbat</em> 10a), the mitzva to make <em>kiddush</em> over wine or bread is of Torah origin. The intent of the Torah is that one should remember Shabbat by means of something connected to Shabbat, which we are commanded to sanctify with food and drink. Raavan maintains that the Torah commandment is specifically wine.</p>

According to Ri, when wine is unavailable one may make <em>kiddush</em> on <em>ĥamar medina</em>, while according to Rambam one should not. Similarly, there is a disagreement about using bread. Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that in the absence of wine one may make <em>kiddush</em> over bread, since, as the backbone of the meal, it is connected to the <em>mitzvot</em> of Shabbat. However, according to Rabbeinu Tam, even if there is no wine, one may not make <em>kiddush</em> over bread. The ruling of SA 272:9 (based on Rosh) is that one who has no wine should make <em>kiddush</em> on Friday night over bread, following the majority of <em>poskim</em>. However, on Shabbat morning, it is preferable to make <em>kiddush</em> over beer. Since there is no special <em>berakha</em> for the daytime <em>kiddush</em>, if one makes <em>kiddush</em> over bread it will not be clear that he is making <em>kiddush</em> at all, since he may well eat bread every day. Therefore it is better to use beer, and to recite &ldquo;<em>ha-motzi</em>&rdquo; over the bread afterward. In Europe, where wine was very expensive, many were lenient and made<em>kiddush</em> by day over beer. Only for the Torah-based <em>kiddush</em> of Friday night did they insist upon using wine (MB 272:29). Nowadays, however, when wine is readily available, one must make <em>kiddush</em> on wine both by night and by day. If one does make <em>kiddush</em> over bread, he must eat one olive&rsquo;s bulk (<em>kezayit</em>) as part of <em>kiddush</em> and another <em>kezayit</em> as part of the meal (SSK 54:21).</p>

Some maintain that if the wine is one quarter of the mixture, it is still considered wine. This is how <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 204:31 understands SA. According to Rema, as long as the wine is more than one seventh of the mixture, it is considered wine (204:5). However, SA points out that our wines are not as strong as their wines, and thus the applicable proportions are different. <em>Pri Megadim </em>and other Aĥaronim explained that only if the majority of the liquid is wine is it considered wine. Sephardim and many Ashkenazim follow this opinion. Other <em>poskim</em> maintain that as long as the liquid tastes like wine and is more than one seventh wine, it is deemed to be wine. This was the ruling followed by the <em>Badatz</em> of the <em>Eda Ĥaredit</em> ( <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 204:8), which was opposed by several leading <em>poskim</em> (<em>Ĥazon Ovadia</em> 6:2). Thus, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate gives supervision to a wine only when the majority of the liquid is wine.</p>

This is also the opinion of a number of the Ge&rsquo;onim. But <em>Tosafot</em>, Rosh, Ran, Ramban, and Rashba maintain that it may be used, and SA also inclines this way. Rema and MB 272:23 state that if the cooked or sweetened wine is tastier, it is preferable to make <em>kiddush</em> over it. Some take the more stringent opinion into account and therefore prefer to make<em>kiddush</em> over wine that has not been cooked or sweetened ( <em>Kitzur </em>SA 77:6; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 272:44).</p>
<p>Nowadays most wines are pasteurized, meaning they are cooked at low temperatures (80-85&ordm; C, 176-185&ordm; F) in order to get rid of bacteria. It is unclear whether pasteurization is considered cooking or not, with ramifications for two issues: 1) May one use it for <em>kiddush</em> even according to those who prohibit <em>mevushal</em> wine? 2) If an idol-worshiping non-Jew touches this wine, what is its status? If it is considered <em>mevushal</em>, then this touch would not prohibit it, since the prohibition of <em>yein nesekh</em> (wine touched by an idol-worshiping non-Jew) does not apply to <em>mevushal </em>wine.<em>Igrot Moshe</em> YD 3:31 states that such wine is considered<em>mevushal </em>(as does <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 272:10). However,<em>Minĥat Shlomo</em> 1:25 states that it is considered <em>mevushal</em> only if its taste, smell, or appearance undergoes a change; rather, pasteurization to eliminate bacteria does not give the wine the status of <em>mevushal</em>. In practice, one may make <em>kiddush</em> over pasteurized wine even<em>le-khatĥila</em>. In terms of the touch of a non-Jew, <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em> one may be lenient, because the prohibition of drinking wine touched by a non-Jew is rabbinic, and in a case of an uncertainty regarding a rabbinic law one may be lenient. One may certainly be lenient in the case of wine touched by a Shabbat-desecrating Jew. Moreover, if such a Jew regularly makes <em>kiddush</em>, many of those who are stringent accede to the lenient opinion, even if the wine has not been pasteurized (see above 1:14).</p>

In brief, a mistake was made when R. Ĥayim Naeh calculated the amount according to Rambam. The measurement of a dirhem (drachma) in use in Rambam&rsquo;s age was a bit smaller than the Turkish dirhem that R. Naeh used in his calculation. Accordingly, Rambam and those who follow him maintain that an egg and a half (which corresponds to a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em>) is 75 ml. Thus writes R. Beinish (<em>Midot Ve-shi&rsquo;urei Torah</em> 30:5; 16:6); R. Ovadia Yosef agrees. (Early Ashkenazic custom was to consider an egg&rsquo;s bulk to be 46 ml and a <em>revi&rsquo;it</em> to be 69.) However, <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em> states that eggs are only half the size they once were. <em>Ĥazon Ish</em> adopts this approach, calculating accordingly that an egg and a half is about 150 ml. MB states that when the mitzva concerned is rooted in the Torah, such as <em>kiddush</em> on Friday night, it is preferable to be stringent and follow <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>. However for rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em> such as the four cups at the Seder and the requirement to make a <em>berakha aĥarona</em>, one need not follow the double <em>shi&rsquo;ur</em> even <em>le-khatĥila</em>. This is also explained in <em>Peninei Halakha: Pesaĥ</em> 16:8; 16:23 and n. 20 <em>ad loc</em>.</p>

If he had already become distracted, he must make another <em>berakha</em> over the wine. If he got up and went somewhere else, he must make <em>kiddush</em> again. However, according to some <em>poskim</em>, even though he did not fulfill the mitzva of <em>kiddush </em>properly, he nevertheless fulfilled it <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, since he did make <em>kiddush</em> over a cup of wine. This is the opinion of <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 271:82 and <em>Or</em> <em>Le-Tziyon</em>, 2:20:7. See SSK 48:9 and n. 57. Since one is in doubt about the law, one who did not drink a <em>melo lugmav</em> may not say <em>kiddush</em> again, but should try to hear <em>kiddush</em> recited by someone else.</p>

It is therefore intrinsically inferior and should not be used for <em>kiddush</em>. However, if there is no other cup available, it is possible that one can be lenient. <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> states that a cup that is meant to be thrown out after one use is not considered a <em>kli</em> (utensil) at all, and therefore may not be used for <em>kiddush</em> or <em>netilat yadayim</em> (ritual hand-washing). If there is no alternative, one should resolve to use the cup multiple times. This gives it the status of a <em>kli</em> (10:23). In contrast, <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 12:23 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 271:41 state that disposable cups may be used for <em>kiddush</em> and <em>netilat yadayim</em> because they are fundamentally reusable. The only reason that people prefer to throw them out rather than wash them is because the cups are cheap. Moreover, they are considered dignified, as people use them when honoring important people. SSK 47:11 also agrees that one may be lenient <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em>. One who does not even have a disposable cup available may make <em>kiddush</em> over the wine in the bottle.</p>

Most <em>poskim</em> say that the way to fix <em>pagum</em> wine is to pour a little non-<em>pagum</em> wine into the <em>pagum</em> wine. However, Maharam of Rothenburg maintains that one can fix the <em>pagum</em> wine only if he pours it into a larger quantity of non- <em>pagum</em> wine. Ideally, this opinion should be taken into consideration, but if one does so without modification, according to most <em>poskim</em> he has now made all the wine <em>pagum</em> . Therefore, he should first pour a little wine from the bottle into the <em>kos</em> that contains the <em>pagum</em> wine. That fixes the wine according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>. Afterward one should pour the contents of the cup into the bottle, thus fixing it according to Maharam as well (see MB 182:27; SHT 23-24). It seems that in a place where it would be considered impolite to pour wine back into the bottle, it is best to follow the majority of <em>poskim</em> and simply fix the wine by adding a bit more to what is in the cup.</p>

Some add that he must send it around to the members of his household (i.e., his wife). R. Yoĥanan said: &lsquo;We only know of four: rinsing, washing, undiluted, and full&rsquo;&rdquo; ( <em>Berakhot</em> 51a). Rambam quotes only the four rules mentioned by R. Yoĥanan. However, this is problematic since R. Yoĥanan himself raises the question as to whether the left hand can assist the right, which evidently means that he considers it a relevant issue as well, even though it is not one of the four things explicitly attributed to him. The Ge&rsquo;onim record all ten criteria as law, while Rosh leaves out only crowning and wrapping. Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona record five as binding &ndash; the first four in the list, plus taking the <em>kos</em> in the right hand. The rest are not obligatory. The Vilna Ga'on explains that the four things mentioned by R. Yoĥanan are mandatory while the rest of the list are a non-obligatory mitzva (183:7). This is also the ruling of MB 183:20. Therefore, if one holds the cup in his left hand, he fulfills his obligation. It would seem that <em>be-di&rsquo;avad</em>, even if he does not hold the cup at all, but simply has it in front of him while he makes <em>kiddush</em>, he fulfills his obligation (MB 182:15). There are varying customs for left-handed individuals. The mainstream <em>poskim</em> maintain that he should take the cup in his left hand, which is his stronger hand (MB 183:20). However, according to Kabbala, he should use his right hand; many follow this opinion (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 183:29, <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 183:10).</p>
<p>There is further debate about the ideal way to hold the cup. <em>Shlah</em>, quoted by MB 183:15, states that based on Kabbala one should rest the cup in the palm of the right hand, with the fingers standing erect around the cup. <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> states that he should first straighten his fingers and then place the cup at the middle of their length. MA 183:6 states that it is possible to understand the kabbalists as saying that one should place his fingers around the cup the way he normally does. See<em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot</em> ch. 5 n. 22 and <em>Harĥavot</em> here.</p>

Those listening fulfill their obligation even if they did not hear the <em>berakha</em> over the wine (SSK 47:40). However, if they wish to drink from the wine, they must recite <em>Ha-gafen</em> themselves.</p>
<p>If, after hearing <em>kiddush</em> but before drinking, one of the listeners spoke about something unrelated to <em>kiddush</em> or the meal, than he must recite <em>Ha-gafen</em> himself before he drinks (<em>Beit Yosef</em>; MA; <em>Taz</em>; MB 167:43; SSK 48:6). However, according to Rema and <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, if the one who made <em>kiddush</em> has already drunk from the wine, then the listener does not need to make another <em>berakha</em>. There is a disagreement among the <em>poskim</em> in the case where the person who made <em>kiddush</em> spoke before drinking, and those listening did not speak. In practice, since whenever we are in doubt about a <em>berakha</em> we are lenient, the listeners in this case drink but must not make a new <em>berakha</em>.

In contrast, <em>Responsa</em> <em>Keren Le-David</em> &sect;84, <em>Ĥelkat Yaakov</em> 4:32, and other Aĥaronim state that even if one eats he does not need to make <em>kiddush</em>, because the obligation to make <em>kiddush</em> goes into effect only after praying. This is because <em>kiddush</em> was ordained for when one is having his meal, as the verse states: &ldquo;Call Shabbat &lsquo;delight.&rsquo;&rdquo; However, one who eats before prayer is doing so because of a lack of choice, for his health and not for delight, so <em>kiddush</em> is not relevant then.

MA understands Rambam&rsquo;s position to be that there is no need for a woman to recite the <em>Amida</em>, but rather any prayer that she recites fulfills her obligation. Accordingly, if she recites <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> she has fulfilled her obligation, as those <em>berakhot</em> are considered prayers (as explained in MB 106:4 and <em>Peninei Halakha</em>:<em>Women&rsquo;s Prayer</em> 2:2-5). The point at which the <em>kiddush</em> obligation goes into effect is dependent on each woman&rsquo;s personal habits. If she generally prays the<em> Amida</em>, then the laws pertaining to her are the same as those pertaining to a man. If she needs to eat or drink before praying, she does not need to make <em>kiddush</em>. Even if she is accustomed to praying the<em> Amida</em> on Shabbat only, she may say <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> while intending not to fulfill her prayer obligation, and then eat and drink before praying without making <em>kiddush</em> first. This is the ruling of SSK 52:13 and n. 44.</p>
<p>However, if a woman does not generally pray the<em> Amida</em>, she is obligated in <em>kiddush</em> from the moment she wakes up on Shabbat. In a difficult situation such as if she does not know how to make <em>kiddush</em>, she may be lenient, since according to Maharam Ĥalawa a woman is exempt from <em>kiddush</em> during the day. Additionally, Raavad and those following his approach maintain that it is not prohibited to eat before the daytime <em>kiddush</em>. Furthermore, some understand Rambam&rsquo;s view to permit drinking water before <em>kiddush</em>, even though it is generally forbidden to eat and drink before <em>kiddush</em>. Therefore, in a case of necessity a woman may drink before<em>kiddush</em>, and if necessary she may even eat. <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 4:28:3 takes this approach, as do SSK 52:13 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 289:6.</p>
<p><em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 4:101:2 puts forth the novel position that there is a special law pertaining to a married woman. Since she needs to eat with her husband, her obligation in <em>kiddush</em> follows his. Thus as long as he has not yet finished his prayers, she may still eat and drink, as she is not yet obligated in <em>kiddush</em>. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach discusses the opinion of <em>Igrot Moshe </em>and concludes: &ldquo;This requires further clarification&rdquo; (SSK,<em>loc. cit.</em> n. 46). In cases of necessity, one may rely on<em>Igrot Moshe</em>. Similarly, if a husband went to an early<em>minyan</em>, and upon his return home wants to make <em>kiddush</em> and eat with his wife, then even though she plans to attend the synagogue later for <em>Shaĥarit</em>, she may make <em>kiddush</em> with him, since the proper halakhic family dynamics dictate that a wife eat with her husband. She should be careful, though, to say <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> first, as I wrote in <em>Peninei Halakha</em>: <em>Women&rsquo;s Prayer</em> 22:10.</p>
