    Chapter Six: <em>Nusach</em> - Wording of Prayer
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    1. The Differences in <em>Nusach</em>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
Following the exile from the Land of Israel, and the scattering of Jewish communities, distinctions were created among the diverse ethnic groups (<em>eidot</em>) regarding the wording of the prayers. In the main prayers, those instituted by <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>, such as    <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, the differences are very slight. Even in the main passages of the <em>Korbanot</em>
    (sacrificial offerings) and <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, which were established during the time of the Talmud and the <em>Geonim</em>, the disparities are
minor. The modifications are more noticeable, however, in the supplements added during the period of the <em>Rishonim</em>, such as additions to the    <em>Korbanot</em> passages and prayers concluding the service. What was customary to include in Spain was not necessarily accepted in Ashkenaz, and vice
versa. This is especially apparent in the liturgy for the High Holy Days and Festivals, composed during the time of the <em>Geonim</em> and    <em>Rishonim</em>. Hence, we find completely different <em>piyutim</em> (poems) in the High Holy Day prayers of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic services.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is proper that every Jew continue in his family's custom. Even if he knows that a certain <em>nusach</em> is more precise, the continuation of tradition
    is more important than the accuracy of one word or another.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Ari HaKadosh</em> clarifies the differences in wording and style between <em>Sephardim</em> and <em>Ashkenazim</em>. He explains that there are
    twelve windows in the heavens corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel and the prayer of each tribe ascends through its particular gate. That is the
enigma of the twelve gates mentioned at the conclusion of the book of Ezekiel (<em>Sha'ar HaKavanot</em> p. 50, 4; <em>Magen Avraham</em> 68:1;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 68:4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Additionally, distinctions exist among the ethnic groups regarding the pronunciation of certain Hebrew letters, e.g., <em>tzadi</em> and <em>kuf</em>, as
    well as vowels, such as, <em>kamatz</em> and <em>cholam</em> and each group must continue its custom. If, however, people change their <em>nusach</em>,
they still fulfill their obligation, for all the existing Jewish traditions relating to the reading of letters and vowels are permitted for prayer (    <em>Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim</em>, part 3, 5; additionally, even regarding the wording of the <em>Chalitzah </em>ceremony in which, according to all
    opinions, every letter must be enunciated, one may fulfill his obligation in any ethnic accent).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    2. No <em>Nusach</em> Should Be Considered More Preferable than Another
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The <em>Chida</em> writes in the name of the <em>Ari</em> that the Sephardic<em> nusach</em> ascends through all twelve gates. Therefore, in his opinion,<em>Ashkenazim</em> are permitted to switch to the Sephardic wording of prayer (see <em>Yabia Omer</em> 6:10; <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 3:6). However, the<em>Chassidim</em> claim that their <em>nusach</em> (<em>Nusach Sephard-Chassidi</em>) is of higher quality. They maintain that the prominent<em>Chassidic </em>authorities investigated numerous wordings and formulas of the Kabbalah, and selected the best among them. Those who pray in    <em>Nusach</em> <em>Ashkenaz</em> assert that their custom is the most meticulous, for it was passed on from person to person as far back as Shimon
    HaPakuli. Furthermore, the foundation for the Sephardic<em> minhag</em> lies within the <em>Amora'im</em> and <em>Geonim</em> of Babylon, whereas the basis
for the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em> originates with the <em>Amora'im</em> and <em>Geonim</em> of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> who were more proficient in<em>Agadah</em>, <em>Chochmat HaSod</em>, and <em>nusachim</em> of prayer. (Incidentally, that is the reason for the similarities between <em>Nusach</em>    <em>Ashkenaz </em>and the original Yemenite <em>nusach</em> [<em>Baladi</em>], for both were influenced by the <em>Geonim </em>of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.)
    The Yemenites, too, claim that their <em>nusach</em> is more precise, for the Jews of Yemen, in all their years of exile, did not wander. Instead, in
    response to the persecution that the Arabs inflicted, the Yemenite Jews intensified their devotion to Torah and observed their customs with extra
    stringency. Indeed the Yemenite Torah scrolls were found to be closer in accuracy to the <em>nusach</em> of the precise <em>Keter Aram Tzova</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In summary, every <em>minhag</em> possesses its own advantages and it is not in our power to determine which <em>minhag</em> is more praiseworthy. As the<em>Chatam Sofer</em> writes (responsa 1:15), all <em>nusachim</em> are equal. He maintains that the <em>Ari</em> composed his <em>kavanot</em> for    <em>Nusach</em> <em>Sephard-Chassidi</em> because he was accustomed to praying in that <em>nusach</em>. However, if a person like the <em>Ari</em> were to
    have resided in Ashkenaz, he would have written his <em>kavanot</em> based on <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Even if we were to know that a particular <em>minhag</em> is more precise, it would still be proper for each person to continue his own <em>minhag</em>,
    for even the less accurate <em>minhag</em> surely possesses advantages that the others do not exhibit. Only after the <em>Sanhedrin</em> is re-established
    will we be able to institute a uniform <em>nusach</em>, which will include the benefits of each <em>minhag</em>. Though, even then, there will be room for
    different emphases in the additional prayers and varying melodies, corresponding to the twelve gates; each community according to its ways.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    3. In What Cases Is One Permitted to Change His <em>Nusach</em>?
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
As we have learned, one must maintain his family's <em>minhag</em>. The <em>Chachamim</em> based this statement on the verse, "    <em>Al titosh torat imecha</em>," meaning, "Do not abandon your mother's teachings" (Proverbs 1:8). However, this custom is no more important than other
    laws, and therefore it is often superseded. For example, when a person knows for certain that he will have less <em>kavanah</em> praying in a synagogue
    that conducts services in his family's <em>nusach</em> than in a synagogue in which the services are conducted in a different <em>nusach</em>, he should
    choose the one in which he can concentrate better, for <em>kavanah</em> is the essence of prayer.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button> However,
in a case of uncertainty, it is preferable to pray in his family's <em>nusach</em>, because in the long term, chances are that he will have more    <em>kavanah</em> praying as his family does. Sometimes, when a person is young, he does not properly value his connection to his family's <em>nusach</em>,
    though as time passes, he discovers a deep attachment to it.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
An Ashkenazi who wants to pray according to the <em>Ari</em>'s writings, and for that purpose wishes to switch to <em>Nusach Sephard-Chassidi</em>,    <em> </em>is permitted to do so. There were some prominent individuals from Ashkenaz who did this, among them the <em>Chatam Sofer</em>'s rabbis, Rabbi
Natan Adler, and Rabbi Pinchas, the author of the <em>Hafla'ah</em>. Nevertheless, their families and students continued to pray in    <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, for they understood that only a specific individual who wants to pray according to the <em>kavanot Ha'Ari</em> is permitted to
    change his <em>nusach</em>, but it is not proper for someone who does not pray with those <em>kavanot</em> to do so. However, the leaders of the Chassidic
    movement encouraged all their followers to switch from <em>Nusach</em> <em>Ashkenaz</em> to <em>Nusach Sephard-Chassidi</em>, despite the fact that most of
    them were not familiar with the <em>Ari</em>'s <em>kavanot</em>. Indeed, prominent rabbis have vehemently disagreed with them, wondering how they could
    have changed their <em>minhag</em>, but the eminent leaders of the Chassidic movement, who were also illustrious world figures, decided to change their
    custom and surely had honorable reasons. Nowadays, no one objects to their practice (see <em>She'arim Metzuyanim BaHalachah </em>18:4; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>
    , <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 24). <em></em>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If a person has a choice of two synagogues, one where the prayer service is conducted in his family's <em>nusach</em> but where no Torah classes are
    organized, and another, which provides Torah study but where the people pray in a different <em>nusach</em>, he must consider his options. If he reasons
    that praying in the synagogue with more Torah will help him learn more, it is better that he pray there even though the service is not conducted in his
    family's tradition. Likewise, in choosing a yeshiva, one should not choose a place of learning according to the <em>nusach</em> of the prayers. Instead, he
    should choose the yeshiva in which he can become more elevated in Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, if a person must choose between two synagogues: one, where the congregation prays in his family's <em>nusach</em>, but he is concerned that he
    will not be able to connect with the people because they are either too old, too young, or too few in number and another, where they do not pray in his
    family's <em>nusach</em>, but there is a unified congregation with which he can better identify. If he feels that by joining the prayers of the latter
    synagogue, his connection to the Jewish religious community will intensify, thereby enhancing or at least sustaining his spiritual level, it is preferable
    that he pray there, even though the prayers are not his family's <em>nusach</em>.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    4. Immigrants and Communities that Migrated
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the past, when the distance between communities was great, <em>Ashkenazim</em> lived in Ashkenaz, <em>Sephardim</em> in Spain, and Yemenites in Yemen.
    Any person who moved to another place would adopt the <em>minhag </em>of his new place and practice the customs of the local Jews regarding halachah and
    prayer. For example, people with the family name "Ashkenazi" follow the Sephardic customs yet are called "Ashkenazi" because they migrated from Ashkenaz to
    Spain. Likewise, families that migrated from Spain to Ashkenaz accepted upon themselves the Ashkenazic customs. Even if, over the course of time, many
    people migrate to a community and become the majority there, as long as they arrive as individuals, they are outweighed by the community in which they
settle, and must practice according to the custom of the new place (<em>Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah</em> 214:2; <em>Orach Chaim </em>468:4;    <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The law is similar regarding a woman who married a man from a different ethnic group. She is considered someone who migrated from her community to his. She
must abide by his practices, whether they are more strict or lenient, and she need not perform a <em>hatarat nedarim</em> (an annulment of vows) (    <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 1, 158).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
When an entire community migrates to another place, since it is its own entity, it does not need to conform to the customs of the people there (    <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 468:4). Even if the original people are the majority, as long as the new ones are united as an independent community, they should
    continue their initial <em>minhagim</em>. Similarly, that is the law in Israel today. By Hashem's grace we merited a great ingathering of Jews from the
    Diaspora<em> </em>(<em>kibbutz</em> <em>galuyot</em>). Myriads of differing ethnic groups arrived, including <em>talmidei chachamim</em>, and each and
every ethnic group founded its own synagogue. Therefore, no ethnic group is invalidated in regard to another and each must preserve its own    <em>minhagim</em>.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    5. Praying in a <em>Minyan</em> Conducted in a Different <em>Nusach</em>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some <em>poskim</em> say that when a person who is accustomed to one <em>nusach</em> goes to pray in a <em>minyan</em> held in a different <em>nusach</em>,
    he must pray according to the <em>nusach</em> of the <em>minyan</em> he is attending, because the individuals must follow the majority. If he practices
    according to his own <em>minhag</em> in front of the people in the congregation, it constitutes a transgression of the prohibition "<em>lo titgodedu</em>"
    (fragmenting the nation into divergent groups). This prohibition disallows having one court of law (<em>beit din</em>) with some judges who rule according
    to the method of <em>Beit Shamai </em>and others who rule according to <em>Beit Hillel</em>, so that the Torah will not be divided into two seemingly
    different Torahs<em> </em>(<em>Yevamot</em> 14a, according to the <em>Rif</em> and the <em>Rosh</em>). Hence, the people of one synagogue should not pray
    in two different <em>nusachim</em>. Furthermore, the <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Pesachim</em> 50b) that a person must not stray from the custom of a
    place so as not to generate dispute (<em>Pe'at HaShulchan</em> 3:14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to most <em>poskim</em>, one is permitted to pray in his family's <em>nusach</em> those parts of the prayer service that are recited silently.
    Since the differences are not noticeable, there is no fear of dispute, nor is there any transgression of the prohibition, "<em>lo titgodedu</em>." However,
    prayers recited aloud should be prayed in the <em>nusach</em> of the <em>minyan</em> so as not to create controversy and disparity among the members of the
    congregation.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
One who must regularly pray in a <em>minyan</em> conducted in a different <em>nusach</em>, e.g., because he moves to a place in which the only    <em>minyan</em> prays in a different <em>nusach</em> or because he prays in the <em>minyan</em> that will strengthen his religiosity, is permitted to
    decide whether to pray in its <em>nusach</em>, or adhere to his own family's custom, reciting the parts said aloud like the congregation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The <em>chazan</em> leading the prayer service in a synagogue employing a <em>nusach </em>that is different from his own must pray according to the<em>minhag</em> of the place because he is praying as the people's emissary. However, for the silent prayers, he may pray according to his own    <em>minhag</em>.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>

<a name="6"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    6. Preserving <em>Minhagim</em> versus Strengthening the Community
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The preservation of <em>minhagim</em>, in addition to maintaining the <em>nusach</em> of the prayer, entails upholding the pronunciation of the prayers.
    Each community - the Yemenites, the <em>Sephardim</em>, and the <em>Ashkenazim</em> - pronounces the prayers according to its own particular dialect. In
    addition, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is proper that each ethnic group continue to pray in its own traditional tunes (see <em>Rama</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>
    619:1). Clearly, it is permissible to introduce new melodies. However, in the main part of the prayer, the traditional tune that was sanctified throughout
the generations should be preserved. For that reason, a person must initially pray in a synagogue which conducts the service in his family's    <em>nusach</em>.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Judaism is comprised of numerous different <em>minhagim</em>. The <em>nusach</em> of the <em>Sephardim</em> is divided into many customs. Concerning
matters of halachah, the key distinctions are evident between those who practice according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and those who follow the    <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>. Furthermore, there is a specific <em>nusach</em> for Jews from North Africa. While the differences in <em>nusach</em> and halachic
    matters among those from North Africa and Iraq and Syria are relatively minor, their melodies contrast more strikingly. Even among the immigrants from
    North Africa there are such distinct disparities in melody, so that Algerians sound dissonant to Moroccans; and to Jews from Libya, both Algerians and
    Moroccans sound off-key. To perfectly preserve the numerous <em>minhagim</em>, there would have to be individual synagogues for immigrants from Tripoli,
    Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco, as well as differing synagogues for immigrants from Iraq, Syria, Persia, and Turkey.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Among Ashkenazic immigrants there are different <em>minhagim</em> as well, the primary distinction being between the <em>Chassidim</em> and all remaining<em>Ashkenazim</em>. Still, there are other significant differences in types of diction and melody. The tunes of those who pray in the <em>Nusach</em>    <em>Ashkenaz </em>from Western Europe are completely different from the tunes in the <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> from Lithuania. Furthermore, regarding
diction, there are at least four variations of pronunciation - those of immigrants from Lithuania, Poland, Galitzia, and Hungary. Different sects of<em>Chassidim</em> also have varying <em>minhagim</em> and distinct melodies. Additionally, among the Yemenites there are two main <em>nusachim</em> -    <em>Baladi</em> and <em>Shami.</em>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, if strictly safeguarding the <em>minhagim</em> will bring about the dismantling of the community, it is preferable to forgo the preservation of
    the customs. In general, when a community is unified, and it arranges Torah study for men, women, and children, and people perform acts of kindness for one
    another, it succeeds in keeping its members committed to Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>. On the other hand, when a community lacks unity and a communal
    dedication to Torah, its members become are weak and above all, its children are adversely affected.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Although <em>l'chatchilah</em> every person should pray according to his family's <em>minhag</em>, if this necessitates the establishment of dozens of
small synagogues, making it difficult to assemble a <em>minyan</em> and organize regular Torah classes, it is preferable that ethnic groups with similar    <em>minhagim</em> merge to form a stronger community. For example, all Jews from North Africa should pray together and if that is not sufficient, then all
    people who pray in the Sephardic<em> nusach</em> should pray together.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Therefore, in each and every place, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons, i.e., the importance of preserving the <em>minhagim</em> against the
    significance of establishing a strong, solid community. When there are enough families from the same ethnic group living in one place, enabling them to
    establish a large synagogue while preserving the traditions of their <em>minhagim</em>, all the better. But when the number of families is insufficient, it
    is best that they join a group with customs similar to their own, provided that they form a strong congregation. If the consolidation of similar ethnic
groups will not be adequate to ensure a strong community, it is better that all the members of the differing groups - <em>Sephardim</em>,<em>Ashkenazim</em>, and Yemenites - merge to become one community. This issue requires serious consideration, and for that reason, it is up to the    <em>mara d'atra</em>, the primary rabbi of the place, to resolve such matters.

    7. Those Accustomed to a Different <em>Nusach</em>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sometimes the question arises regarding how a person should practice when his father, who is a member of one ethnic group, becomes accustomed to praying in
    a <em>nusach</em> of a different ethnic group. Should he pray in the <em>nusach</em> in which his father currently prays or in the <em>nusach</em> of his
    father's ethnic group? As a general rule, the obligatory <em>minhag</em> is that of the ethnic group and not one's father's individual <em>minhag</em>.
    However, when the son prefers to continue in his father's adopted <em>nusach</em>, or because he finds it difficult to change, or for any other reason, he
    is permitted to continue praying in his father's <em>nusach</em>. Since this question poses implications on other issues, it is best that one consult with
    his rabbi on this matter.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
A similar dilemma arose among members of Chassidic families, who learned in Lithuanian <em>yeshivot</em> and became accustomed to praying in    <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>. When they left the yeshiva, they deliberated whether to continue praying in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> as they were taught in
    yeshiva, or return to praying in <em>Nusach Sephard</em>-<em>Chassidi</em>, the <em>minhag</em> of their parents.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The rabbis of the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em> taught that, in principle, they must continue praying in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, for in the past, all
    Ashkenazi<em>c</em> Jews prayed in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, and only 200 years ago did the <em>Chassidim</em> change their <em>nusach</em>. Even though
now, after such a long time, all <em>Chassidim</em> will not be instructed to return to pray in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>, still, it is best that those<em>Chassidim</em> who already became accustomed to praying in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> continue to pray that way, because it is their ancestors' original    <em>nusach</em>. However, the Chassidic rabbis insisted that they must continue in the Chassidic <em>nusach</em>, reasoning that since prominent Chassidic
    authorities have instructed those who prayed in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> to switch to the <em>Nusach Sephard</em>-<em>Chassidi</em>, in congruence with the
    writings of the <em>Ari</em>, all the more so, anyone born into a Chassidic family must continue praying in the Chassidic <em>nusach</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, since there are differing opinions, the person posing the question may choose how to practice. Still, it is best to consult with one's rabbi
    on this matter.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    8. <em>Ashkenazim</em> Who Pray with a Sephardic Pronunciation
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A similar question arose among Ashkenazic immigrants from the <em>dati-leumi</em> (national-religious) community. Approximately three generations ago, with
    the beginning of the gathering of the exiles, a need was felt to consolidate the Diaspora communities and to restore the Jewish nation to its Hebrew
    language. For unification purposes, the Sephardic pronunciation was chosen. Even though Maran HaRav Kook <em>ztz"l</em>, and many other <em>poskim</em>,
    are of the opinion that each ethnic group must preserve its own accent in prayer, in actuality, since the spoken Hebrew and the Hebrew learned in schools
    were in a Sephardic pronunciation, the Sephardic accent became imbedded in the prayer service too. Indeed, many leaders of national-religious educational
    institutions, acting in accordance with the rulings of a few rabbis, instructed their Ashkenazic students to pray with Sephardic pronunciation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are some rabbis who spoke strongly against the <em>Ashkenazim</em> who changed their accent. Some taught that even people who find it difficult to
    pronounce all the prayers in an Ashkenazic pronunciation should at the very least pronounce Hashem's Name in that manner, because the pronunciation of
    Hashem's Name in the Ashkenazic accent has greater grammatical advantages (<em>Har Tzvi Orach Chaim</em> 1:4; <em>Az Nidberu</em>, part 3, 48:1, according
    to the <em>Chazon</em> <em>Ish</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, in practice, most rabbis do not encourage their students to change their pronunciation. Since the Sephardic accent is just as acceptable as the
    Ashkenazic, and everyone is used to it, there is no obligation to return to one's original accent. Moreover, if the effort to change one's pronunciation
    will disrupt his <em>kavanah</em> in prayer, it is preferable not to change it. It is best that one who already prays in a Sephardic accent also say
    Hashem's Name that way so as not to mix accents. There are even those who are concerned that one who combines accents <em>b'dieved</em> does not fulfill
    his obligation (<em>Rav Yosef Henkin</em>; <em>She'arim Metzuyanim BaHalachah</em> 18:5). Therefore, it is customary to recite the whole prayer service,
    including Hashem's Name, in the Sephardic accent.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    9. Members of Different Ethnic Groups Praying Together
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In many places, members of all the different ethnic groups pray together. That is the accepted practice in many <em>yeshivot</em>, so as not to cause a
    daily schism between the students, as well as in small communities which do not have enough people for each group to maintain a large <em>minyan</em> to
    pray and learn Torah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the past, in order to refrain from disrupting the prayer service and creating separate <em>minhagim</em> within the same synagogue, the congregation
    would establish one <em>nusach</em> according to the majority (see <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 4, 34). However, in our society, where
    people are familiar with and accustomed to the different <em>minhagim</em>, in many places it is customary to give each ethnic group expression in the
prayer service. Usually, the congregation follows the <em>chazan</em>. For example, if the <em>chazan</em> is Sephardic, he will pray in the Sephardic    <em> nusach</em>, and if he is Ashkenazic, he will pray in the Ashkenazic<em> nusach</em>. There are places that even if the <em>chazan</em> is Yemenite,
    although his pronunciation varies greatly from the norm, he prays in his Yemenite dialect. Since all the <em>minhagim</em> are acceptable and known to all,
    there is no fear of "<em>lo titgodedu</em>," and it is not likely to incite controversy.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
That is how we practice in Har Berachah. When there are major differences between the <em>minhagim</em>, it is our custom to follow the shorter<em>nusach</em>. For example, on "<em>Bet-Hei-Bet</em>" (fast days enacted on Monday and Thursdays by some ashkenazic authorities), when the<em>Ashkenazim</em> customarily say <em>Selichot</em>, we do not recite them communally, since the <em>Sephardim</em> do not follow this custom. Similarly,    <em>Shir HaShirim</em> (Song of Songs) is not recited before <em>Kabbalat Shabbat</em>, though it is the <em>minhag</em> of many <em>Sephardim</em>.
    Likewise, we do not recite all the passages of the <em>Korbanot</em> (sacrificial offerings) out loud in the <em>minyan</em>, as is the Sephardic
    tradition. Those who wish to say them recite them individually before the prayer service. However, when the extension to the prayer service is not
    burdensome, the congregation follows the <em>chazan</em>; for instance, at the end of the prayer service, when the <em>Sephardim</em> prolong the recital
    of the Psalm of the Day and the <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em>, or the <em>Tachanun</em> of Mondays and Thursdays.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Sephardic<em> minhag</em> is that the <em>chazan</em> recites all the Psalms and <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> out loud, in order to fulfill
    the obligation for a person who does not know how to read. Nevertheless, the prevalent custom is that even the Sephardic <em>chazanim</em> say only the
    conclusion of the <em>mizmorim</em> and <em>berachot</em> out loud. This is because nowadays everyone knows how to read, and the recital aloud prolongs the
    duration of the prayer service and disrupts the <em>kavanah</em> of some of the people praying.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    As a general rule, regarding prayers recited out loud, the congregation follows the <em>chazan</em>, while concerning prayers recited silently, each person
prays according to his individual <em>minhag</em>. Nonetheless, it is unnecessary to be meticulous concerning this, and one who wishes to pray in the    <em>chazan</em>'s <em>nusach</em> is permitted to do so, for that is the opinion of some <em>poskim</em>. One who wishes to pray in his own <em>nusach</em>
    , even those passages recited aloud, is permitted to do so, as long as he says them quietly, so as not to disturb the congregation and accentuate the
    differences between him and the <em>chazan</em>.
</p>

    When the Sephardic<em> chazan</em> recites the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy three times in the prayers of supplication (<em>tachanunim</em>) of Mondays and
    Thursdays, it is proper that the <em>Ashkenazim</em> follow along with him.

To conclude, in all these situations, in which the benefit to the community and to the prayer service are weighed against the preservation of    <em>nusachim</em>, the <em>mara d'atra</em>, the primary rabbi of the place, must determine what is best.

            See <em>Shut Maharam Shik</em>,<em> Choshen Mishpat</em> 24, which states that even though the <em>Magen Avraham</em> writes that one should not
            stray from his family's <em>nusach</em>, one is permitted to switch from <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> to <em>Sephard-Chassidi</em> if he so desires. He
            cites <em>Chovot HaLevavot</em> saying that one's deep passion for a certain mitzvah indicates his deep connection to that mitzvah. All the more
            so, he is permitted to switch <em>nusachim</em> for the purpose of having more <em>kavanah</em>. The matter of the community's significance, of
            which I will write later on, is of obvious importance. See <em>Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim</em>, part 4, 33.

            However, if her husband does not mind, she may continue to pray according to her previous <em>nusach</em> (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 1, note 7).
            Nevertheless, it is proper for her to switch to her husband's <em>nusach</em> before her children reach the age of understanding, so they will not
            be confused why their parents are praying in different <em>nusachim</em> (<em>Tefillah Kehilchatah</em> 4, note 4).

            The prayers recited silently may be prayed in one's own <em>nusach</em>. However, the <em>Kedushah</em>, which is recited out loud, should be
prayed in the <em>chazan</em>'s <em>nusach</em>, as written in <em>Shut Sho'el U'Meishiv</em> Edition 3, 1:247, <em>Meishiv Davar</em> 1:17,<em>Shivat Tzion</em> 5, <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 23, and <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 7:5. Regarding<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, and <em>Nefillat Apayim</em>, the <em>poskim</em> are uncertain. According to the            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 23, since one is permitted to say <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> out loud, it is better that he says
            them in the <em>chazan</em>'s <em>nusach</em>. Similarly, concerning the matter of <em>Nefillat Apayim</em> on Mondays and Thursdays, there is a
difference in custom. According to <em>Nusach Sephard</em>, we put our heads down before <em>Tachanun</em>, and according to <em>Nusach</em>            <em>Ashkenaz</em>, after <em>Tachanun</em>. The <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 3, 89, writes that one may not stray from the
            custom of the place because it would be noticeable. However, the widespread custom is that every person prays according to his <em>minhag</em>.
            Since it is known that there are many different <em>minhagim</em> in prayer, the prohibition of "<em>lo titgodedu</em>" is not applicable in this
            case. Yet, those praying in a<em> nusach</em> different from that of the <em>chazan</em> should not call attention to themselves by praying out
            loud, as mentioned in <em>Tefillah Kehilchatah</em> 4, notes 23 and 26. However, the <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 10, maintains that even prayers
            which are recited out loud should continue to be prayed by each person in his own <em>nusach</em> and there is no fear of "<em>lo titgodedu</em>"
            nor controversy because everyone knows that different <em>minhagim</em> exist. Nonetheless, even according to his opinion, it seems that one should
            not actually recite those prayers aloud, because if he does, he incites controversy. <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <strong>In practice</strong>
            , the person praying is permitted to choose a <em>nusach</em> - his or the <em>chazan</em>'s - however, for the more noticeable prayers, it is
            proper to pray according to the <em>chazan</em>'s <em>nusach</em>. Further, see <em>Igrot Moshe</em> <em>Orach Chaim</em>, Part 4, 34, outlining
            the aspects of the prohibition to pray according to different <em>minhagim</em> in one synagogue.

            However, <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 10:8, discusses a mourner who is accustomed to praying in one <em>nusach</em> and comes
            to a place in which the people pray in a different <em>nusach</em>. If they let him lead the prayer service according to his <em>nusach</em>, he
            can lead. If not, it is better that he does not lead the prayer service and that he prays silently according to his own<em> nusach</em>. However,
            most <em>poskim</em> do not agree. The <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, part 2, 29 and part 4, 33, maintains that even while praying silently he must pray
like the congregation because the silent <em>Amidah</em> prayer was intended as preparation for <em>Chazarat HaShatz.</em> The            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 5:19 responds to this, saying that since he is reading from a <em>siddur</em>, there is less need for preparation.

            In the opinion of the <em>Rashdam</em> 35, the warning, "Do not abandon your mother's teachings," does not apply to <em>minhagim</em>, rather only
to laws. Therefore there is no concern in changing one's <em>nusach</em> of prayer. However, the <em>Hagahot Maymoniyot</em>, based on the            <em>Yerushalmi</em>, writes that we are not to switch our family's <em>nusach</em>, and the <em>Magen Avraham</em> 68:1 cites his opinion as the
            halachah. That is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> as well. In practice, concerning an issue of law, it is more important to preserve
            the <em>minhag</em>. However, regarding non-law-related matters, such as liturgy, and even more so melodies, it is possible to be more lenient in
            changing them.

            In addition to this, even though it would be proper that every group preserved all its own <em>minhagim</em> and melodies, there is also a positive
            aspect to the merging of the Diaspora communities in Israel. Since a person does not necessarily choose a place to live based on his ethnicity, a
            situation is already created in which the similar <em>nusachim</em> can consolidate. Today most <em>Ashkenazim</em> practice that way; people with
            different traditions pray together.

The position of the rabbis who pray in <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> is brought in <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 2, 24, as well as in            <em>Tefillah Kehilchatah</em>, in the name of Rav Elyashiv. Their opinion is that <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> is the <em>nusach</em> in which it is
proper for all <em>Ashkenazim</em> to pray. However, Rav Elyashiv adds in the next paragraph that one who has regularly prayed in a different            <em>nusach </em>since he was born, and it is difficult for him to change, may continue praying in the <em>nusach</em> to which he has become
            accustomed, for that is what the <em>Chazon Ish</em> and Rabbi Yaakov Kanievsky have taught. The opinion of the Chassidic rabbis is widely known.

            <em>Mishpatei Uziel</em>
            ,<em> Orach Chaim </em>1, maintains that it is proper for all the ethnic groups to pray in a uniform <em>nusach</em> and accent. Maran HaRav Kook
            commented on this, saying that every ethnic group must preserve its own <em>minhagim</em>. He continues that one who changes his accent is
            considered like "one who recited [the <em>Shema</em>] and was not meticulous in enunciating the letters," for even though he fulfills his
            obligation, he should not do so <em>l'chatchilah</em>. That is the opinion of most rabbis, among them <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 3:9, and 4:47, 4,
and <em>Az Nidberu</em>, part 3, 48:1. However, a number of Sephardic rabbis, including <em>Yaskil Avdi</em>, part 2, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 3, and            <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 11, write that an <em>Ashkenazi</em> is permitted to switch to the Sephardic accent. They praise
            the Sephardic<em> nusach</em> and note that since it is spoken today in the Holy Land, it is therefore proper to pray in it. However, it is
            noteworthy that the spoken accent today is less precise than the original Sephardic accent, for today's spoken accent does not differentiate
between a <em>tet</em> and a <em>taf</em>, between a <em>kuf</em> and a <em>kaf degushah</em>, between a <em>taf</em> <em>degushah </em>and a            <em>taf refuyah</em>, or between a <em>kamatz</em> and a <em>patach</em>. From a certain standpoint, it is the worst of all the pronunciations, for
            it does not have the virtues found in the Ashkenazic dialect, and it is missing a few of the advantages present in the Sephardic dialect.
            Nevertheless, <em>Yabia Omer</em> does not comment on this.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In any case, after people have already become accustomed to the Sephardic accent, even according to those who maintain that in principle one must
            revert to his family's <em>nusach</em>, if it is difficult to do so, and it will disrupt one's <em>kavanah</em>, one need not revert to the
            Ashkenazic <em>nusach</em>. That is what my teacher and rabbi,<em> </em>HaRav Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen<em> </em>Kook, <em>ztz"l</em>, maintained.
            Furthermore, he mentioned that there are things which are accepted by the community even though the <em>Chachamim</em> are not pleased with them.
            He also said that something good comes out of this: members of different ethnic groups can pray together, and unity is increased.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The <em>Yabia Omer</em> 11:6, quotes Rabbi Unterman, the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi of Israel, in saying that the <em>Ashkenazim</em> who became
            accustomed to praying in the Sephardic accent should not be compelled to revert to the Ashkenazic pronunciation. That is how they were educated and
            they are comfortable in this accent, because it is widespread throughout the whole country. The <em>Yabia Omer</em> adds that it is preferable that
            they pray in the spoken dialect, for in that way the youth will feel more of a sense of belonging to the synagogue and the prayer service. One may
            add that even if a person stands before a king, he will talk in the accepted dialect, and he will not begin to precisely pronounce the letters. We
            learn many of the laws of prayer from an individual who stands before a king using the <em>kal vachomer</em> principle.
