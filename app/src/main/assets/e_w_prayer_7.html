        <a name="_Toc402175191">1. Women’s Connection to Torah</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Torah belongs to all of Israel, men and women alike. When we recite
"Who has chosen us from among all the nations" in        <em>Birkat Ha-Torah</em>, we mean that God chose all of Israel, men and
        women, and consequently "gave us His Torah." There is an accepted
        tradition: If even one Jewish maidservant would have been absent at the
        time of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, the giving would have
        been delayed. Likewise, the mitzva of <em>hak’hel</em> (the assembly at
        the Temple at the end of the <em>Shemita </em>year, at which the king
        would read part of the Torah to all Israel) applies to men, women, and
        children (Devarim 31:12). <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Nevertheless, women are exempt from the mitzva to study Torah, as it is
        written: "You shall teach them to your sons, to speak them [– words of
        Torah]" (Devarim 11:19). The Sages extrapolate: "Your sons and not your
        daughters" (<em>Kiddushin</em> 29b).<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        However, when it comes to the general connection to the Torah, we find
        that women precede men. For example, when the Torah was given Moshe was
        instructed to address the women first. It is written: "Thus you shall
        say (<em>tomar</em>) to the house of Yaakov and tell (<em>tageid</em>)
        the sons of Israel" (Shemot 19:3). The Sages teach, "The house of
        Yaakov" ("Beit Yaakov") refers to the women, who he must address in a
        gentle voice. "The sons of Israel" refers to the men, to whom he must
        speak more harshly, telling them of punishments and particular details.
The word "<em>tageid</em>" alludes to the body’s tough sinews ("        <em>gidin</em>"), connoting harshness. Further, the Sages derive from
        the introductory phrase "Thus you shall say" that God instructed Moshe
        to be meticulous about this sequence, namely, first the women and then
        the men (<em>Mekhilta</em>, cited in Rashi).<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Moreover, we learn about proper respect for the Torah and respect for
        Torah scholars from the Shunamite woman, who would visit the prophet on
        Shabbat and Rosh Ĥodesh (2 Melakhim 4:23; RH 16b). It is no coincidence
        that respect for the Torah is learned from the example of a woman,
        because women have more of a connection to the sublime general aspect
of the Torah (<em>Siĥot Ha-Ritzya</em>, Shemot pp. 178-181).        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        That is, there are two ways to connect to the Torah. One is
        intellectual: the mitzva for men to study Torah. The second is a
        general attachment, which pertains more to women. In daily life, the
        mitzva for men to study Torah is clearly more prominent; however, over
        the long-term, the holistic manner with which women relate to faith and
        to the Torah has a greater impact. This is the meaning of the Sages’
        dictum: "Greater is the promise that God made to women than to men."
        The Sages explain that women received an extra guarantee by virtue of
        the fact that they send their sons to study Torah and encourage their
        husbands to study in the <em>beit midrash</em>, waiting happily for
        them to conclude their studies without pressuring them to come home
        soon (based on <em>Berakhot</em> 17a). <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is the very exemption of women from the scrupulous study of the
        Torah’s details that allows them to absorb the general, morals-oriented
        aspects of the Torah, thereby better enabling them to encourage their
        husbands and sons to study Torah and thus perpetuate the Torah among
        Israel. There is no doubt that men also have a profound connection to
        the holistic aspect of the Torah, for all the details and particular
        nuances stem from the Torah as a whole. By the same token, women, too,
        must know the parameters of the fundamentals of faith as well as
        practical <em>halakha</em>, as will be clarified in the next section.
        However, as a rule, men more easily connect to the Torah’s precise
        definitions, whereas women connect to the general expression of the
        Torah in life. Through men and women together, the Torah is expressed
        in its entirety. <strong></strong>

        <a name="_Toc402175192">2. The Mitzva of Torah Study for Women</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There is a fundamental difference between the mitzva of Torah study for
        men and for women. The men’s mitzva is to study Torah, whereas the
        mitzva for women is to know the <em>mitzvot</em> of the Torah so that
        they can life accordingly. In other words, a woman who knows all of
        practical <em>halakha</em>, as well as all the fundamentals of faith
        and ethics on the level and with the profundity necessary to guide her
        through life, has no further mitzva to continue studying. However, a
        man who already learned the entire Torah, even if he were to know it by
        heart, is still required to continue studying and delve deeper into the
        Torah. <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Hence, there are two parts of Torah study. The first is to understand
        the Torah’s instructions, in <em>halakha</em> and faith, in order to
        live a full life. Men and women are equally obligated in this aspect.
        The second part inclines toward in-depth scrutiny, analysis, and
        abstraction. Men are obligated in this, but not women. Men and women
        therefore have different curricula. The most important part of the
women’s syllabus is to know all the fundamentals of faith, ethics, and        <em>halakha</em>, whereas, the men’s syllabus, in addition to the study
        of <em>halakha</em>, faith, and ethics, should emphasize learning
        Gemara and its commentaries. Nevertheless, women who wish to delve into
        the Torah for God’s sake may study Gemara in-depth as well, on
        condition that they first learn thoroughly the fundamentals of faith,
        morality, and the laws that they must know. In particular,
        intellectually sophisticated women must study extensively and
        internalize the fundamentals of faith and <em>halakha </em>before
        delving into the Gemara, so that their reverence for God precedes their
        wisdom.<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        For women who do not possess an especially strong desire to delve
        deeply into the Torah, the Sages’s general guideline is: do not engage
        in theoretical debates about differing opinions; rather, study a clear,
        practical summary of the <em>halakhot </em>and their reasons, and delve
        deeply into the principles of faith and ethics. <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There were eras in which it was sufficient for women to learn the laws
        relating to the household and family on a rudimentary level and then
        hear a bit of moral admonishment. This was enough to instill an
        identity within them and generate the proper dedication to fulfilling
        the Torah and leading a Jewish life. However, in recent generations,
        with the increase in leisure time, the development of general
        education, and professional specialization in various fields, it is
        obvious that women must learn much more than they had in the past.
        Indeed, under the guidance of prominent rabbinic leaders of recent
        generations, educational and religious institutions for girls and women
        have been founded. One prominent example is the "Bais Yaakov" movement,
        established in Poland by Mrs. Sarah Schenirer, with the encouragement
        and support of eminent Polish rabbis. <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        These modern changes do not negate the fundamental halakhic difference
        between men, who are commanded to study Torah as a theoretical and
        intellectual endeavor, and women, who are not obligated to do so. Rav
        Kook explains that it is precisely this distinction between men and
        women that allows for the emergence of a state of harmony between
        analytic intellectualism and the vibrant and natural emotion that
unites and establishes the words of Torah in real life (        <em>Ein Ayah</em>, <em>Berakhot </em>7:46).

        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>
        are comprised of three parts. In the first part, we bless God Who
        sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us to occupy
        ourselves with words of Torah. In the second, we request that the
        Torah, which God taught His nation of Israel, be sweet for us, that we
        study it with relish, and that we and our descendants have the
        privilege of knowing the Torah.
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In the third part, we bless and thank God for choosing us from among
all the nations and giving us His Torah. The Sages say (<em>Berakhot</em> 11b) that this is the choices of all        <em>berakhot</em> because it mentions Israel’s uniqueness – that God
        "chose us from among all the nations" and consequently "gave us His
        Torah." This is the nature of Israel’s soul: it cleaves and clings to
        God and His Torah, and so only Jewish people can receive the Torah and
        with it illuminate the world. Among the nations of the world, there may
        be righteous and devout gentiles, but this is a personal piety of
        individual people who lack the ability to repair the entire world. As
        is apparent from our long history, only the Jewish people can serve God
        within a national framework and strive to rectify the world in the path
        of truth and <em>ĥesed</em>.<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The second and third parts of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>certainly
        pertain to women. In the third part, we praise and thank God Who chose
        us from among all his nations and gave us His Torah. In this regard,
        men and women are equal, as noted (section 1). The second part, too,
        pertains to women, for women also pray that the Torah be pleasant in
        our mouths and in the mouths of our descendants. However, regarding the
first part, a question arises: How can women recite "        <em>Asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu</em>" ("Who has sanctified
        us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us") on engaging in Torah
        when they are exempt from the mitzva of Torah study? Some maintain that
        women may recite a blessing on any mitzva from which they are exempt,
because the phrasing of the <em>berakha</em> is not "        <em>ve-tzivani</em>" (in singular person) – that they themselves as
        individuals were commanded – but rather "<em>ve-tzivanu</em>" (in the
plural), meaning the entire Jewish people. This includes        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> (Rabbeinu Tam, Ran, Rema). Others say, as a
        rule, that women may not recite a <em>berakha </em>on <em>mitzvot</em>
        from which they are exempt (Rambam, <em>Or Zaru’a</em>, SA), but
        nevertheless they may recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, since, as we
        have seen, women must learn practical <em>halakhot</em> and the
fundamentals of faith; they may therefore recite the words "        <em>Asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu</em>."

        <a name="_Toc402175194">4. The Value of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em></a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        After the decimation of Eretz Yisrael and the exile of the Jewish
        people, a major question arose, reflected in the words of the prophet
        (Yirmiyahu 9:11): "Why has the land been lost?" Everyone certainly
        understood that we were exiled from our land because of our sins; they
        were asking which sin was at the root of the spiritual collapse that
        led to the destruction. The Sages, the prophets, and the ministering
        angels were asked this question and did not know how to answer, until
        God Himself explained. "God says: ‘Because they abandoned My Torah
        which I had given them’" (<em>ibid</em>. 9:12). The Sages of the Gemara
        interpret this to mean that they did not recite the <em>berakha </em>on
        the Torah before engaging in its study (<em>Nedarim</em> 81a). That is,
        although they studied Torah, they did not relate to it as divine
        instruction. Because of this, they were considered to have forsaken the
        Torah of God. For anyone who learns Torah as if it is just another
        discipline of human wisdom is not considered to be one who studies
        Torah. However, when we recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> properly, we
indeed approach Torah out of faith and attachment to its Giver.        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages further inquire (<em>Nedarim</em> 81a): Why is it that not
        all the children of Torah scholars continue in their parents’ paths and
        become Torah scholars themselves? Presumably, the parents made efforts
        to educate their children to follow in their footsteps and become
        engrossed in Torah all their lives. If so, why did they not all
        succeed? Moreover, in those days, it was widely accepted that every son
        continued in his father’s profession; sons of carpenters became
        carpenters, sons of farmers became farmers, and so on. Consequently,
        the Gemara’s question is all the more perplexing – why don’t a
        relatively large percentage of sons of Torah scholars become Torah
        scholars themselves? The Gemara offers several reasons, the last of
which is that of Ravina: it is because they do not recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> before studying. That is, the sons of Torah
        scholars often study Torah only because they saw their fathers doing
        so; as sons like to mimic their fathers, they too make efforts to study
        Torah. However, Torah can only be acquired by studying for God’s sake,
        out of a personal attachment to its Giver. Therefore, those sons who
        study out of habit or by mimicking their fathers do not succeed in
        their studies.<strong></strong>

            5. Whether the Recitation of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> is a
            Biblical Mitzva and the Status of <em>Birkat Ahavat Olam</em>
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
"R. Yehuda says in the name of Rav: whence do we derive that a        <em>berakha </em>prior to Torah study is of biblical origin? As it is
        written: ‘When I call the Lord’s name, ascribe greatness to our God’
        (Devarim 32:3)" (<em>Berakhot</em> 21a). The meaning of this passage is
        that the Torah is comprised entirely of God’s names (<em>Zohar </em>
        2:87:1; <em>Tikunei Zohar </em>§10), for He is completely concealed
        from us, and through the Torah God is revealed to the world. Thus, the
        Torah is God’s "names" – the way He is made manifest in the world. That
        is the meaning of the verse, "When I call the Lord’s name" – before
studying Torah, "Ascribe greatness to our God" – recite a        <em>berakha </em>to its Giver. <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In practice, the Rishonim are divided concerning the meaning of this
        derivation. Most Rishonim, among them Ramban and Rashba, understand
these words straightforwardly: there is a biblical mitzva to recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Consequently, when one is uncertain about
        whether he recited <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, he must be stringent and
        recite them, in keeping with the principle that we we are stringent
        concerning matters of biblical uncertainty. This is the Ashkenazic
        custom (MB 47:1; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 10:3). However,
        according to Rambam and SA (209:3), <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> are a
rabbinic enactment, and the extrapolation from the verse is a mere        <em>asmakhta </em>(reference). Accordingly, in a case of uncertainty,
        one must be lenient and not recite the <em>berakhot</em>. This is is
the custom of the Sephardim (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>47:2).        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
Nonetheless, all agree that a woman who is not sure whether she recited        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> does not repeat the <em>berakhot</em>. If she
wishes to avoid uncertainty, she should recite the <em>berakha </em>of        <em>Ahavat Olam</em> (<em>Ahava Rabba</em> in the Ashkenazic version)
        and make sure to recite <em>Shema</em> afterwards, so as to study a
        passage of Torah after having recited the <em>berakha </em>on it.

        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The reason that one who recites <em>Ahavat Olam</em> fulfills her
        obligation, <em>be-di’avad</em>, of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> is
because <em>Ahavat Olam</em> incorporates within it all the content of        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>(SA 47:7). Although the Torah is not
        mentioned in its conclusion at all, since it mentions Israel as the
        chosen people – "Who chooses His people Israel with love" – and the
        Torah and Israel are intertwined, it is as if the Torah is mentioned.
Likewise, we see that the most important of the        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> states "Who chose us from among all His
        nations and gave us His Torah," which illustrates that the subjects of
Israel and the Torah are interconnected and co-dependent.        <strong></strong>

            Recited?
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One must recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> before studying any part of
the Torah (SA 47:2). In other words, even one who only intends to learn<em>Midrash</em> or <em>halakha</em> on a particular day must recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> at the onset of that day. The reason for this
is that the entire Torah – whether the Written Torah or the Oral Torah,        <em>halakha </em>and theology – was all given from God to Moshe at
        Sinai (<em>y</em>. <em>Pe’ah </em>2:4), and when studying them, one
        must recite, "Who chose us from among all His nations and gave us His
        Torah." <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The <em>poskim </em>disagree about whether <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>
        must also be recited before thinking Torah thoughts. For example, one
        who arises in the morning with the desire to ponder a few ideas of
Torah, according to most <em>poskim</em> does not need to recite the        <em>berakhot</em>. Still, there are those who disagree. In order to
        avoid uncertainty, one who wakes up and wishes to reflect upon words of
        Torah should first recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and immediately
        afterwards recite a few verses. However, one who temporarily wakes from
        her sleep in the middle of the night and wants to contemplate Torah
ideas until she falls back to sleep need not recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> beforehand. Those who listen to Jewish music
        when they wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night do not
        need to recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> since they do not have
intention to learn (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 10:4 and n. 4).        <strong></strong>

        One may recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>

        are those who insist that <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> be recited while
        standing or walking, not while sitting or lying down (<em>ibid</em>.

The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether men must repeat        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> after regular sleep (<em>ibid. </em>10:6).
However, it is a matter of consensus that women only recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> once in a 24-hour period and do not repeat
        them after a regular sleep. Therefore, a woman who wakes up after
midnight and intends to go back to sleep a few hours later recites        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> after her main
        rising (as explained above, 6:6).

        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether a man who was awake all

        for a full 24-hour period does not recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> in
        the morning; instead, she says <em>Birkat Ahavat Olam</em> and
        afterwards recites the first paragraph of <em>Shema</em>, thereby

            In <em>Sota</em> 20a, according to Ben Azai, a father must teach
            his daughter Torah, whereas according to R. Eliezer, he may not do
            so, for one who teaches his daughter Torah is as if he has taught
            her frivolity ("<em>tiflut</em>"). That is also the opinion of R.
            Yehoshua. <em>Y</em>. <em>Sota</em> 3:4 explains that according to
            R. Elazar b. Azaria, women are commanded to hear the Torah but not
            to study it in depth. Rambam (MT, Laws of Torah Study 1:13) rules
            in accordance with R. Eliezer that one should not teach his
            daughter Torah, because most women’s minds are not geared for that,
            and if they are taught the Oral Torah it is as if they are taught
            frivolity. All this is said in reference to the Oral Torah, but
            teaching one’s daughter the Written Torah (Scripture) is not
            considered teaching her frivolity (<em>Tur </em>and SA,<em> </em>YD
            246:6, even though Rambam says that a father should not reach his
            daughter Scripture either), since <em>hak’hel</em> includes a
            commandment to make the Written Torah heard to all of Israel,
            including women. Therefore, it is impossible to say that one who
            teaches his daughter the Written Torah is considered to have taught
            her frivolity.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            However, a woman who wants to learn on her own, not because her
            parents or institutional context obligates her, may do so. It is
            even a credit to her, as Rambam says (<em>ad loc.</em>): "A woman
            who learned Torah receives rewards, but not the same as a man’s
            reward, as she was not commanded, and whoever performs an action
            that he is not commanded to perform is not rewarded like one who
            was commanded. Rather it is less." It seems, therefore, that the
            entire prohibition is for a father to initiate Torah study with his
            daughter; but if she herself is interested in doing so for heaven’s
            sake, there is no prohibition; on the contrary, she is rewarded.
            Likewise, Rambam explains (MT, Laws of Torah Principles 4:14) every
            single person has a mitzva to love God and fear Him. The way one
            achieves total love and fear for God is through Torah study,
            initially by studying talmudic debates and knowing what is
            permitted and what prohibited, and later through the study of the
esoteric "work of creation" ("<em>ma’aseh bereishit</em>")            <em> </em>and "work of the chariot" ("<em>ma’aseh merkava</em>").
            Concerning this, Rambam writes: "These are the greatest good that
            God bestowed on the civilized world so that it may inherit the
            World to Come; and it is possible that everyone understands them –
            adult and minor, man and woman, one whose mind is expansive as well
            as one with limited knowledge…" (R. Rabinovitch writes this as well
            in his commentary on MT, <em>Yad Peshuta</em>). It seems,
            therefore, that the future ideal of a world filled with the
            knowledge of God where is one where all women study Torah of their
            own volition and with complete understanding, thereby arriving at
            the love and fear of God in its totality. As we know, in the past
            there were women prophets and sages. However, it seems that even in
            the ideal there is a difference between the character of men’s and
            women’s learning.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            In summary, a woman whose heart is set on in-depth Torah study may
            engage in it, and it is to her credit. Still, good and righteous
            women who have no desire for this type of study should not be
            taught, and if one does teach them, it is as if he has taught them
            frivolity. It seems that the reason for this is twofold. One aspect
            pertains to the feminine nature, which makes it appropriate that
            she delve into Torah study out of her own desire and freedom. The
            second reason is that for most women, during the time that the
            domestic yoke is great and there is very little leisure time,
            theoretical Torah study cannot be undertaken properly. This makes
            it like frivolity, and the damage caused by this learning is
            greater than the benefit gained.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            All of this applies solely to theoretical study. Women are
            obligated to study Torah in order to perform <em>mitzvot</em> (Rema
            YD 246:6, based on <em>Agur</em> and <em>Smak</em>). Therefore, SA
            47:14 rules that women must recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, since
            women must learn what is necessary for them to live a life of
Torah. Today, it is apparent that women need to learn            <em>halakha</em> and its reasons, along with the fundamentals of
            faith, for without this learning, their religious lives would
            certainly not be on the appropriate level. Therefore, it is an
            obligation to teach girls however much is necessary in order for
            them to uphold the Torah and become settled in their faith.

The Rishonim and Aĥaronim disagree regarding how many            <em>Birkhot HaTorah </em>there are. According to Rabbeinu Tam,
            Rosh, and others, there are two <em>berakhot</em>, as the second
            part is a continuation of the first. Therefore, one must begin the
            second part ("<em>Ve-ha’arev</em>") with a conjunctive vav, and one
            does not answer "Amen" upon the conclusion of the first part.
            According to Rambam and others, there are three <em>berakhot</em>.
            The first section is its own <em>berakha</em> and is followed by
            "Amen"; the second part begins "<em>Ha’arev</em>" (without a vav).
            SA 47:6 states that it is preferable to start "<em>Ve-ha’arev</em>"
            in order to fulfill the obligation according to all opinions. MB
47:12 states that it is the opinion of most Aĥaronim not to answer            <em>Amen</em> at the end of the first part. Therefore, it is best
to say it quietly in order to avoid uncertainty. Nonetheless,            <em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em> and <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>47:10 and 47:13
            state in the name of Arizal that one should answer "Amen" after it,
even though we say "<em>Ve-ha’arev</em>," for they are two separate            <em>berakhot</em>.

SA 47:14 states, "Women recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>."<em>Beit Yosef</em> cites <em>Agur</em> and            <em>Responsa Maharil</em> <em>Ha-ĥadashot </em>§45, which state
            that although women are not obligated and the Sages even say that
teaching one’s daughter Torah is like teaching her frivolity (            <em>Sota</em> 20a), this refers to the Oral Law, not the Written
Law. Furthermore, women recite <em>Korbanot</em> and must recite a            <em>berakha</em> before their recitation. Moreover, they must learn
            the laws that pertain to them, as <em>Smak</em> states. According
            to this approach, a woman may recite the <em>berakha </em>even on
            behalf of men.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The Vilna Gaon explains (<em>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</em>, end of §47) that
            they recite the blessings on the Torah just like on all other
            time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, for according to Rabbeinu Tam, Ran,
and Rema (589:6) they may recite a <em>berakha </em>on those            <em>mitzvot</em>. Many other Aĥaronim agree. According to Gra’s
            approach, women may not recite the <em>berakha </em>on behalf of
            men.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Still, based on this reason, it is difficult to understand how SA
            permits women to recite the <em>berakha</em>, for it follows Rambam
            that women may not recite a <em>berakha </em>on <em>mitzvot</em>
that they are not obligated to perform (17:2; 589:6). Indeed            <em>Responsa Ĥikrei Lev</em> (OĤ<em> </em>10) maintains that women
            may not recite "
            <em>
                Asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu la’asok be-divrei Torah
            </em>
"; however, he implies that they may recite the <em>berakha</em> "<em>Asher baĥar banu</em>," for it is a blessing of praise. Ĥida (            <em>Responsa Yosef Ometz</em> §67) explains that it is permissible
            for women to recite the <em>berakha</em> according to SA since that
            was the ancient custom. This must be because women must learn the
            laws that pertain to them in order to know how to fulfill them (as
            written in <em>Sefer Ĥasidim</em> §313). Although this requirement
            does not stem from the mitzva of Torah study, nevertheless, since
            women may actually learn, they may recite the blessing. It is
explained in the name of R. Ĥayim Soloveichik of Brisk that            <em>Birkat Ha-Torah</em> is not merely a <em>berakha</em> recited
            upon the performance of the mitzva but reflects a separate law:
            that one is required to recite a <em>berakha </em>before engaging
            in Torah study. And since women must engage in Torah study in order
to know the laws that pertain to them, they must recite the<em>berakha</em>. A similar approach appears in<em>Oraĥ Mishpat</em> §11. For further study, see            <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>3:1-2 and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 47:18
            which summarize the issue, as well as<em> Ishei Yisrael</em> 7, nn.
            31-32.

            According to <em>Birkei Yosef</em> 47:8, even those who maintain
            that the recitation of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> is a biblical
            commandment, women only have a rabbinic obligation, and therefore
            in any case of uncertainty, they do not recite the <em>berakha</em>
            . However, according to BHL 47:14, based on the explanation of MA,
            a woman may recite the <em>berakha</em> on a man’s behalf, despite
            the fact that his obligation is biblical, which suggests that a
woman’s obligation is also biblical. Nevertheless, by reciting            <em>Ahavat Olam</em>, all opinions agree that she evades doubt.
Earlier (chapter 6 n. 4), we explained that the recitation of            <em>Shema</em> is certainly considered a fulfillment of Torah study
            for women, even if it is not clear whether it is so for men.

            <em>Tzlaĥ</em>
            , <em>Berakhot</em> 11b offers a novel insight: A woman who
            interrupted her studies to do other things and then returned to her
            studies must repeat <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Men do not repeat
            the <em>berakhot</em> because their obligation to study lasts
            through the day and night, but a woman has no such obligation;
            rather, every time she studies she must make a new <em>berakha</em>
            . However, this opinion was not accepted as <em>halakha</em>. Rav
            Kook (<em>Tov Ro’i</em> on <em>Berakhot</em>, §95) writes that
            since the basis of women’s obligation of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>
            is inferior to that of men, it makes no sense for the less
            important obligation to exceed the more significant one. In
            addition, <em>Birkei Yosef </em>(cited in <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>
            47:34) states that in any case of uncertainty women do not recite
the <em>berakhot</em>. Although in n. 4 we mentioned that there are            <em>poskim</em> who disagree with <em>Birkei Yosef</em>, which
maintains that all agree that women’s obligation in            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> is rabbinic, nevertheless, in practice,
            it seems that they agree they do not recite the <em>berakha</em> in
cases of uncertainty (<em>Halikhot Beitah </em>3:3,5;            <em>Halikhot Shlomo </em>6:4).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Furthermore, based on what we explained in sections 1 and 3 above,
we can explain that the primary reason that women recite            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>is is their connection to the whole of
            the Torah, its fulfillment, and their requirement to study
practical laws, principles of faith, and ethics. Therefore, the            <em>berakha</em> does not pertain to any particular study; rather
            it is a general <em>berakha</em> regarding the essence of the
            Torah, and it resembles all of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> in that
            there is no need to say it more than once a day.
