Chapter Ten: The Principles of <em>Hagalat Kelim</em>

1. When Does Taste Absorbed into Utensils Render Their Contents Forbidden?
</h2>
<p>
    Though the walls of pots and other vessels appear solid and impervious, they actually absorb the taste of food cooked in them. Thus, if one cooks
    non-kosher meat in a pot, its flavor gets absorbed into the pot's walls, and kosher meat subsequently cooked in the same pot becomes forbidden, as the
    non-kosher taste absorbed in the walls is released and absorbed by the meat.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    However, there is a principle that anything which contributes foul taste ("<em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em>")<em> </em>does not cause other foods to become
    forbidden. For example, if a bit of foul-tasting non-kosher meat falls into some kosher meat, the meat may be eaten since the non-kosher taste is foul. The
    same applies to tastes absorbed by vessels. Moreover, the rule is that any taste absorbed by a vessel becomes foul after twenty-four hours. Therefore, if
    non-kosher meat is cooked in a pot, and twenty-four hours later kosher food is cooked in the same pot, the latter dish remains kosher because the taste in
    the pot is foul, and foul taste does not render food forbidden (SA YD 103:5).
</p>
<p>
    However, it is forbidden <em>le-khathila </em>to use a pot that has absorbed non-kosher taste, even after twenty-four hours have elapsed, because the Sages
    were concerned that one would forget and inadvertently cook in it <strong>before</strong> twenty-four hours have elapsed. They therefore ruled that since
    such a pot is forbidden to begin with, it may not be used until koshered (SA 122:2). <em>Be-di'avad</em>, if one forgot that the pot absorbed the taste of
    forbidden food and cooked another food in it, if twenty-four hours passed from the time the non-kosher food was cooked, the food in question remains
    kosher. But if one knows that a pot had absorbed a non-kosher taste, but cooks kosher food in it anyway, the Sages penalized him by prohibiting this dish
    for him and his family, even though the non-kosher taste in it had already turned foul.

2. <em>Hametz</em> Utensils on Pesah
</h2>
<p>
Vessels used throughout the year with hot <em>hametz</em> foods cannot be used during Pesah since heat causes vessels to absorb the taste of<em>hametz</em>. In order to use such utensils during Pesah, one must first remove the taste of the <em>hametz</em> through <em>hagala</em> or    <em>libun</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If one cooks in such a pot on Pesah knowing that it had not been koshered, even if twenty-four hours have passed and the taste of the <em>hametz </em>has
    been befouled, the cooked food is forbidden. As we have learned, the Sages forbade such food in order to penalize people who deliberately cook in vessels
    that have absorbed <em>hametz</em> and have not been koshered.
</p>
<p>
What if one errs and cooks in a pot that was not koshered for Pesah? According to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, if twenty-four hours have elapsed since the    <em>hametz</em> was cooked in the pot, the food may be eaten on Pesah, because the taste of the released <em>hametz</em> is foul. According to Rema, the
food is forbidden even though the <em>hametz</em> is foul because the prohibition of <em>hametz</em> is especially severe, for even a drop of    <em>hametz</em> causes a food to be forbidden (SA 447:10; see above 7:5).<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hametz</em>
    utensils that one does not wish to make kosher for Pesah must be cleansed of any residual <em>hametz</em> and put away in a closed place so that nobody
    inadvertently uses them during Pesah (SA 451:1; see also above 6:4, where we learned that such utensils should not be sold).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. Releasing through the Same Method as Absorption ("<em>Ke-bole'o Kakh Polto</em>"): <em>Hagala</em> and Heavy <em>Libun</em>
</h2>
<p>
The most basic principle of koshering cooking utensils is that forbidden taste is released from the vessel in the same manner that it was absorbed: "    <em>ke-bole'o kakh polto.</em>" There are two principal media through which utensils absorb taste: boiling liquid and direct flame.
</p>
<p>
    If a pot absorbs a forbidden food through a process of boiling - for example, if it was used to cook <em>hametz </em>food like pasta or porridge - the pot
    is made kosher for Pesah by immersing it in boiling water, which causes the <em>hametz </em>taste to be released. The same applies to ladles and serving
    spoons: when used with <em>hametz</em> foods hotter than <em>yad</em> <em>soledet bo</em> (hot enough to cause the hand to recoil), they absorb the taste
    of the <em>hametz</em> and must be koshered through immersion in boiling water.
</p>
<p>
    However, if a vessel absorbs <em>hametz</em> through direct heat of fire, without a liquid medium - such as in the case of a cake baked on a tray, dough
    baked on skewers, or jachnun or kugel baked in a pot - it is koshered by means of heavy <em>libun</em>, that is, heating the vessel by fire until it gives
    off sparks or becomes red hot.
</p>
<p>
    Absorption through a liquid medium is relatively mild, so boiling hot water is sufficient to extract the taste of the <em>hametz</em> from the utensil.
    Absorption into a tray or skewer is more intense, as the heat of the fire causes the taste of the food to be absorbed deep into the very particles of the
    utensil. Boiling water is insufficient to remove all of the absorbed taste, and such utensils must be koshered by the same means that they absorbed - by
    fire. This is "heavy <em>libun,</em>" in which the fire incinerates the taste that had been absorbed in the utensil.
</p>
<p>
    To highlight the difference - <em>hagala</em> extracts the taste absorbed in the vessel, while <em>libun</em> incinerates it <em>in situ</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, before undergoing <em>hagala</em>, a vessel must be cleaned of any residual food, because <em>hagala</em> releases the taste absorbed into a
    utensil but does not destroy the residual food stuck to it. There is no need, however, to clean a utensil before <em>libun</em>, because any food that
    remains will be completely incinerated in the <em>libun</em> process.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Defining the Difference between Absorption through Liquid and Absorption through Fire: the Status of a Frying Pan
</h2>
<p>
    Even when a baking tray is coated with oil to prevent sticking, the absorption that occurs during the cooking process is considered to be by means of fire,
    thus requiring heavy <em>libun</em> to render it kosher. Only when the oil at the bottom of the vessel sizzles and bubbles is the absorption considered to
    be by means of a liquid.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    In light of this, most Rishonim maintain that a frying pan can be koshered through <em>hagala</em> (Rosh, Raavya). Even if the oil is used up and the food
    burns, <em>hagala </em>is sufficient since there was oil present at the beginning of the frying process, and the taste of the food absorbed into the pan
was by means of the oil, i.e., the milder form of absorption. The same applies to a pot in which a non-kosher food was cooked: the pot can be koshered by    <em>hagala</em> even if the food dries up and burns (MB 451:63; <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>137).
</p>
<p>
    However, several leading Rishonim maintain that a frying pan has the status of a baking tray and must be koshered via heavy <em>libun</em>, because people
    often fry with small amounts of oil, and the oil is often used up, causing the taste of the food to be absorbed via fire (Rashba). Although there is
    agreement that a pot can be koshered through <em>hagala</em> even if the food dries up and burns, there is reason to be more stringent about frying pans
    because only a small amount of oil is used from the outset, and it often gets used up.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, frying pans should ideally be koshered via light <em>libun </em>(as will be explained in the next section), although if twenty-four hours have
    passed since the frying of the forbidden food, <em>hagala</em> is sufficient <em>be-di'avad</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
A Teflon or "non-stick" frying pan, in which food is fried without oil, cannot be koshered for Pesah. In theory it is possible to kosher it via heavy    <em>libun</em> like a baking tray, but as a practical matter this will damage the pan (as will be explained below, section 7).
</p>
<p>
    A frying pan used primarily for making malawach, which is baked and heated without sizzling oil, must be koshered by heavy <em>libun </em>since the
    absorption takes place via fire. But a pan generally used for other things and infrequently used for malawach may, in extenuating circumstances, be
    koshered via <em>hagala</em>, in accordance with its primary usage (as will be explained below, section 9).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>Libun: Does Temperature Affect Absorption?</h2>
<p>
    Heavy <em>libun</em> means heating a utensil by fire until any <em>hametz </em>taste in it is incinerated. One indication that <em>libun </em>has taken
    place is that the utensil undergoing <em>libun </em>becomes so hot that sparks fly from it when it is brought into contact with iron. Another indication is
    that its outer layer peels off, or that it becomes red hot.
</p>
<p>
    Light <em>libun</em> means heating a utensil by fire to the point that a piece of straw or thread placed on the opposite side of the utensil becomes
    blackened from the heat. For example, to kosher a frying pan through light <em>libun</em> one must place the pan over fire and then put a piece of paper on
    the frying surface. When the paper starts to become scorched, the pan has been koshered.
</p>
<p>
    Light <em>libun</em> is not effective where heavy <em>libun</em> is required, because the objective of <em>libun </em>is to incinerate any taste absorbed
    into the utensil, and this is only achieved through heavy <em>libun</em>. However, light <em>libun</em> is more effective than <em>hagala</em> because it
    is more capable than <em>hagala </em>at extracting the taste of <em>hametz</em> from the utensil, and apparently it can also incinerate some of the
    absorbed taste. Sometimes, when it is uncertain if <em>libun</em> is necessary, one may suffice with light <em>libun</em>. Light <em>libun </em>has another
    advantage as well: if a utensil has crevices that are difficult to clean, <em>hagala</em> cannot kosher it, since <em>hagala</em> removes the taste
    absorbed into a utensil but cannot render kosher the residual food stuck in its grooves. However, if one performs light <em>libun</em> and aims the fire at
    the grooves, the residual food will be incinerated, and the utensil will be rendered kosher. Light <em>libun</em> can be performed by putting a utensil in
    an oven and heating it at the highest temperature for about half an hour.
</p>
<p>
    It is worth noting, however, that some <em>poskim </em>rule leniently that a utensil that has absorbed <em>hametz</em> via fire does not necessarily
    require heavy <em>libun</em>. In their opinion, the principle of <em>ke-bole'o</em> <em>kakh</em> <em>polto</em> applies to the temperature at the time of
    absorption. Thus, if a utensil absorbed the taste of forbidden food at a temperature of 300�C, it can be koshered at the same temperature, and if the
    absorption occurred at 200�C, it can be koshered at 200�C, even though it does not become red hot or give off sparks at this temperature. According to
    these authorities, a cooking tray that absorbed a forbidden taste in an oven can be koshered in that oven at the same temperature as the absorption. The
practical <em>halakha</em> follows the majority opinion, namely, that a vessel that absorbed taste via fire and reached a temperature beyond <em>yad</em>    <em>soledet</em> must be koshered by heavy <em>libun</em>. However, in extenuating circumstances and when there are other reasons to be lenient, we take
    the lenient opinion into consideration.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    It should be emphasized that absorption through fire can only happen while the food is being cooked by the fire on the flame. For example, if one cuts a
    baked good while it is on the burner, the knife absorbs the taste of the food through fire. However, if the baked goods were first taken off the fire and
    then cut, even if the baked goods are dry, the absorption is considered mild, and the knife may be koshered through <em>hagala</em>.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. Koshering Vessels That Absorbed <em>Hametz</em> Prior to the Onset of the Prohibition
</h2>
<p>
    We have learned that if a utensil absorbs a forbidden food by means of fire, it must be koshered by fire. It is important to note that this principle
applies only when non-kosher food has been absorbed. For example, if one roasts non-kosher meat on a skewer, the skewer must be koshered through    <em>libun</em>, because the non-kosher food was absorbed by means of fire. However, if at the time of absorption the meat was kosher, and only later became
    non-kosher, the utensil may be koshered through <em>hagala</em>. To use a classic example, if a <em>korban</em> (Temple offering) was roasted on a skewer,
    and the meat of the <em>korban</em> later becomes <em>notar </em>(the sacrificial meat left over when the time to eat the <em>korban</em> ends, which must
    be incinerated and not eaten), the taste absorbed by the skewer is also <em>notar </em>and thus forbidden. The skewer may not be used until it has been
    koshered, but it is not necessary to perform <em>libun</em>. <em>Hagala</em> is sufficient because the skewer absorbed the taste of the meat while it was
    still permitted for consumption.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Accordingly, if one mistakenly baked meat and then dairy (or vice versa) in the same tray, the status of the tray depends on whether twenty-four hours
    elapsed between the baking of meat and dairy. If less than twenty-four hours elapsed, the baked food is forbidden because the flavor of meat mixed with the
    dairy food. The tray also absorbed forbidden taste, and thus heavy <em>libun</em> is required to kosher it. But if twenty-four hours elapsed, the taste of
    the meat became foul, and thus the dairy food may be eaten. Moreover, although the Sages rule that the tray must be koshered, <em>hagala</em> is
    sufficient, because it did not absorb any forbidden taste. In practice, since people are accustomed to putting such trays in the oven, the best thing is to
kosher it through light <em>libun</em>, i.e., by putting it in the oven at the highest temperature for half an hour, for we have already seen that light    <em>libun</em> is more effective than <em>hagala</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    The leading Rishonim disagree about whether the absorption of <em>hametz</em> during the year is considered the absorption of permissible matter, in which
    case baking trays can be koshered for Pesah by means of <em>hagala</em>, or the absorption of forbidden matter. According to most <em>poskim </em>and SA
    551:4, <em>hametz</em> has the status of forbidden food even though it is completely permissible throughout the year, since vis-a-vis Pesah <em>hametz</em>
    is always considered forbidden and even before Pesah it bears the name "<em>hametz.</em>" According to this opinion, baking trays must be koshered via
    heavy <em>libun</em>. However, in extenuating circumstances and where there are other reasons to be lenient, the lenient position is occasionally relied
    upon (MB 451:28).

7. >Utensils Likely to Be Damaged by <em>Libun</em>; Baking Trays
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, the objective of <em>libun</em> is to incinerate all taste absorbed into a utensil. To that end, the utensil must be heated to a very
high temperature (more than 300�C). There are two ways to tell that a vessel has reached such a temperature. One is that the utensil undergoing    <em>libun </em>becomes so hot that sparks fly from it when it is brought into contact with iron. The other indication is that its outer layer peels off, or
    that it reddens completely.
</p>
<p>
    However, some utensils are likely to be damaged by this process. It is forbidden to kosher such utensils through <em>libun </em>because we are concerned
    that, in an attempt to protect his utensil from damage, the owner will not perform <em>libun</em> properly. For example, it is forbidden to kosher an
    earthenware vessel that has absorbed non-kosher food or <em>hametz</em>, because <em>libun</em> is liable to crack the vessel. Nor is <em>hagala</em>
    effective on earthenware vessels because their unique composition causes them to absorb taste but not sufficiently release it. The only way to kosher an
    earthenware vessel is to return it to the kiln, where it is impossible to protect it from the full force of the kiln's furnace. As a result, the vessel
    will either break and be lost or survive and be kosher (SA 451:1; MB <em>ad loc. </em>13, 14).
</p>
<p>
    Wonder Pots (an Israeli invention used for baking on stovetops) absorb taste though fire and therefore require heavy <em>libun</em>. However, since they
    are made of aluminum they cannot endure the <em>libun</em> process, and hence there is no way to kosher them for Pesah (although if it was used to bake
    only simple cakes, one may be lenient and kosher it by means of <em>hagala</em>, as explained above in section 4).
</p>
<p>
    Baking trays designed for domestic ovens become severely damaged by heavy <em>libun</em>. They lose their pleasant appearance and become warped to the
    extent that most people would no longer consider them usable. Therefore, they cannot be koshered through <em>libun</em>. There are, however, industrial
    baking trays that do not become seriously damaged by fire, and it is permissible to perform <em>libun</em> on such trays for Pesah.
</p>
<p>
It is possible that one who knows that he will not care if his tray becomes warped and unattractive would be permitted, in time of need, to perform    <em>libun</em> on such a tray. After all, every time <em>libun</em> is performed there is a risk of some damage, and the Sages only forbade <em>libun </em>
where there is concern that the utensil will be completely ruined. When one will not be distraught if his baking tray is damaged, he may kosher it via    <em>libun</em>.<em> </em>In practice, though, one should ask a competent authority what to do in this case.

</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. The Principles of <em>Hagala</em>
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, a pot absorbs the taste of the foods cooked in it. Cooking has the capacity to mix the tastes of different foods with one another, and
    just as cooking can cause the taste of meat to be absorbed by potatoes cooked with it, so too it can cause the taste of a food to be absorbed in the walls
    of the pot in which it is cooked.
</p>
<p>
    There are, however, different levels of intensity in cooking, and the operative principle is <em>ke-bole'o kakh</em> <em>polto</em>. Thus, if the
absorption is caused by intense cooking, the koshering process must be equally intense. However, if the cooked food never reaches the temperature of    <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em> (45�C according to the opinion that sets <em>yad soledet</em> at the lowest temperature), there is no reason to be concerned
    about absorption, and it is not necessary to perform <em>hagala</em> to kosher the utensil.
</p>
<p>
    The levels of koshering are as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on the flame: </strong>
    The most intense form of cooking is that of a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> (the vessel in which the food is cooked) on a flame, where the fire heats the
    mixture of food continuously, causing its different tastes to be absorbed into each other and by the walls of the pot. <em>Ke-bole'o kakh polto</em>: In
    order to kosher such a vessel, one must immerse it into the boiling water of a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on a flame. It must be emphasized that even if
    the water in the pot was not boiling when the non-kosher food or <em>hametz</em> was absorbed, it must boil during <em>hagala</em>, because the principle
    of <em>ke-bole'o kakh</em> <em>polto</em> relates only to the type of absorption - <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> or <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em> - but
    whenever dealing with absorption in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on the burner, the koshering must be carried out with boiling water.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> removed from the flame:</strong>
    This refers to a vessel that was heated over a flame and then removed, or the flame was extinguished. Such a vessel still has the capacity to cook, and
    food placed in it will become slightly cooked from the lingering heat from the fire. Nevertheless, the heat continuously dissipates, as does its capacity
    to cook. Therefore, it need not be koshered in a pot of boiling water on a flame; it is sufficient to place it in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> that is no
    longer on a flame.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Liquid poured </strong>
    <strong>("<em>irui</em>")</strong>
    <strong> from a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>:</strong>
    This has the capacity to cook the surface layer ("<em>kedei</em> <em>klipa</em>") of a food item. For example, if <em>hametz</em> soup was poured into a
    bowl from a <em>kli rishon</em>, the taste of <em>hametz</em> will be absorbed by the surface layer of the bowl but will not penetrate its entire width. To
    kosher such a bowl, it is sufficient to pour boiling water over it from a <em>kli rishon</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em>:</strong>
    This refers to hot food that was first cooked in a vessel over fire and then transferred to a different one. The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether
such a food can cause its taste to be absorbed into the surface layer of other foods or utensils. For example, if one places a spoon in a <em>kli</em>    <em>sheni</em>, some <em>poskim</em> say it will not absorb the taste of the food in the vessel, and others say it will. Regarding all other forbidden
foods, SA (YD 105:2) rules that although, according to the prevailing opinion, <em>hagala</em> is not required, it is nonetheless proper to do so    <em>le-khathila</em>. Regarding Pesah, however, SA (451:5) rules that <em>hagala</em> is required. Due to the severity of the <em>hametz</em> prohibition,
    the lenient position is not even mentioned (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>20).
</p>
<p>
    Some are even stringent regarding a <em>kli shlishi </em>and beyond, that is, utensils at least twice removed from the vessel in which the food was cooked,
maintaining that as long as a food remains at the temperature of <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em>, a vessel will absorb its taste and must be koshered -<em>ke-bole'o kakh</em> <em>polto</em>. However, most <em>poskim</em> are lenient in this respect. Nevertheless, because of the gravity of the<em>hametz</em> prohibition, it is customarily preferable to be strict about koshering any vessel that contained <em>hametz</em> at the temperature of    <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em>.

</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
9. What Determines the Type of <em>Hagala</em>: Main Use or Most Intense Absorption?
</h2>
<p>
    According to SA (451:6), if a utensil was sometimes used as a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> and other times as <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em> it is koshered
    based on majority usage. Thus, if it was used primarily as a <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em>, it can be koshered like a <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em>. Likewise,
    if it was sometimes used in fire, but primarily used as a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>, it may be koshered in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>. And if it was
    sometimes used as a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>, but primarily used cold, it can be koshered in cold water. According to Rema, on the other hand, the
    utensil must be koshered based upon its most intense usage, not according to its predominant use.
</p>
<p>
    To illustrate, if a particular spoon is usually used to eat soup from a <em>kli</em> <em>sheni</em>, and occasionally used to stir food in a pot on the
fire, <em>Shulhan Arukh </em>maintains that it is koshered based on its primary usage, which in this case would mean <em>hagala</em> in a <em>kli</em>    <em>sheni</em>, whereas according to Rema it must be koshered via <em>hagala</em> in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>, in keeping with its more intense form
    of absorption.
</p>
<p>
    Rema's rationale is that once the utensil has absorbed the taste of foods in a more intense fashion, the only way to remove what has been absorbed is by
    koshering the utensil with the same intensity. <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>'s opinion is based upon the presumption that the koshering of the utensil takes place
more than twenty-four hours after its last use, at which point the absorbed taste is foul. According to the Torah, such a utensil does not require    <em>hagala</em>. The Sages, however, required that any utensil that has absorbed the taste of forbidden food be koshered, out of concern that if they were
    to permit the use of such utensils after twenty-four hours had elapsed, people might misjudge the time and inadvertently treat leniently utensils that had
    been used in the past twenty-four hours. But the Sages required that such utensils be koshered according to their common use, and not their most intense
    use.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, the custom <em>le-khathila </em>is to be stringent and to kosher every utensil according to its most intense usage. Furthermore, even if a
    utensil's most intense usage was <em>irui</em>, the custom today is to kosher all utensils in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on a flame, in order to avoid
    a situation in which one has forgotten that a utensil was in fact used as a <em>kli rishon </em>on a flame. However, in extenuating circumstances, one may
    be lenient and kosher a utensil according to its primary use (MB 451:47; <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad</em> <em>loc.</em> 100).
</p>
<p>
If a utensil was used primarily as a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> and occasionally on the fire, even Rema allows koshering via light <em>libun</em> (MB    <em>ad loc. </em>48). If there is a concern that even light <em>libun</em> will damage the utensil, it is considered a <em>be-di'avad </em>situation, and
    one may kosher it in a <em>kli rishon</em>, in accordance with its primary use (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>108).

</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
10. Cleaning and Preparing Utensils for <em>Hagala
</h2>
<p>
    A utensil must be cleaned properly before undergoing <em>hagala</em>, for although boiling water extracts the taste absorbed in the utensil, it does not
    clean the utensil of residual food stuck to its walls. If <em>hagala</em> is performed without first removing food residue, it is completely ineffective;
    the utensil must be cleaned, and <em>hagala</em> must be redone.
</p>
<p>
    If the utensil has crevices containing food particles that cannot be removed, the residue can be incinerated via light <em>libun</em>. It is best to do so
before performing <em>hagala</em>, but the utensil becomes kosher even if it the <em>libun </em>is done afterward (MB 451:25; see <em>Kaf</em>    <em>Ha-hayim</em> 160).
</p>
<p>
    If it is impractical to incinerate the food particles in these areas because it will damage the utensil, one may soak the utensil in a mixture of water and
    bleach or soap for a short while (thus rendering the food foul and inedible), and then perform <em>hagala</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p>
    Pot and pan handles must also be koshered because when metal vessels are heated during cooking, the heat spreads to the handles, and if they reach the
    temperature of <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em>, the taste might be transferred to them. The handles of wooden pots must also be koshered, even though they do
    not become very hot, because hot food often spills over or splashes onto them, and they absorb the taste. Therefore, both the utensil and its handles must
    undergo <em>hagala</em> (SA 451:12; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 68). However, even if the pot itself absorbs at a heat of a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> over fire,
its handles can be koshered through <em>irui</em> from a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>, because they do not absorb with the same intensity as a <em>kli</em>    <em>rishon</em> over fire (Rema 451:12).
</p>
<p>
    Many pots have handles that are attached with small screws, and food particles get stuck in their grooves. Therefore, before performing <em>hagala</em> the
    bolts must be taken off so that all of these particles can be removed. If this is difficult to do, one may soak this area of the pot in a mixture of water
    and bleach or some other harsh liquid cleanser in order to render the food particles completely befouled.

11. The Reason to Wait Twenty-Four Hours before <em>Hagala</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is customary not to perform <em>hagala </em>on a utensil until twenty-four hours have elapsed (and it is no longer "<em>ben yomo</em>")<em> </em>since
    the last time it absorbed a forbidden food. This is because the absorbed taste remains flavorful during these twenty-four hours, and if the boiling water
is not sixty times the volume of the utensil, the water will absorb the forbidden taste and transfer it back into the walls of the utensil, rendering the    <em>hagala</em> ineffective. But if twenty-four hours have elapsed, the taste in the utensil becomes foul, and the utensil can be koshered even if the
    water is not sixty times its volume. This is because the utensil releases a foul taste into the water, and such a taste will not render the utensil
    un-kosher, even if it is reabsorbed. The utensil is only rendered un-kosher if it absorbed positive flavor, in which case it remains un-kosher even once
    the flavor has become foul. However, if at the time of its absorption the taste was foul to begin with, the utensil is kosher.
</p>
<p>
    Another reason for this twenty-four hour delay is our concern that meat and dairy utensils will undergo <em>hagala </em>in the same water. In such a case,
    the positive flavors of meat and milk will be released into the water, and if the water is not sixty times the volume of either the meat or the dairy, they
will not be <em>batel</em>. Rather, these flavors mingle and then render all of the water forbidden. Consequently, any utensil that undergoes    <em>hagala</em> in this water will absorb <em>basar be-halav </em>(the forbidden mixture of milk and meat) and become forbidden. However, once the utensil
    is not <em>ben yomo</em>, the tastes of milk and of meat in the utensils is foul, and even if the tastes mingle within the water, they do not become
    forbidden, since <em>noten</em> <em>ta'am</em> <em>li-fgam</em> is permitted (SA 452:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em>). Accordingly, one must ensure that a large pot
    in which other utensils undergo <em>hagala </em>did not absorb the <em>ben yomo </em>taste of meat, milk, or <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The common practice at public <em>hagala</em> stations is to presume that at least some of the utensils brought are not <em>ben yomo</em>. In order to
    avoid problems, a strong cleanser such as bleach or liquid soap is added to the water, thereby immediately rendering any taste released by the utensils
    foul. Consequently, there is no concern that meat and dairy flavors will mix or that the tastes released will be reabsorbed by the utensils, because once a
    taste has become foul, it cannot render utensils forbidden.

12. Hagala in Practice
</h2>
<p>
The <em>hagala</em> water must actually be boiling, and this is a <em>sine qua non </em>with regard to utensils that have absorbed <em>hametz </em>as a<em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> on the fire. As we have learned, the practice, <em>le-khathila</em>, is to perform <em>hagala</em> on all utensils in a    <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em> over fire.
</p>
<p>
    The entire utensil must be submerged in the water for a few seconds.
    <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
    Sometimes the immersion of utensils cools the water to the point that it stops boiling. In this case, the utensils should be left in the water until it
    returns to a boil.
</p>
<p>
    If a utensil cannot be immersed in its entirety into the water, it can be immersed one half at a time (SA 451:11).
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, when immersing two utensils into the boiling water at one time, one should shake the utensils to ensure that the boiling water circulates
    between them (based on SA 452:3-4).
</p>
<p>
    Common practice, <em>le-khathila</em>, is to rinse the utensils with cold water after <em>hagala</em>, so that the hot water does not remain on them and
    cause them to reabsorb the taste released during <em>hagala</em>. This is not essential, however, since <em>hagala </em>is normally performed when the
    utensil is not <em>ben yomo</em> or in water that has a foul taste, so that even if the utensil reabsorbs the taste of the water, it will not be rendered
    un-kosher (SA 452:7; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 34). Therefore, one should not rinse utensils with cold water if this is liable to damage them. Likewise, if for
    some reason it is difficult to rinse a utensil with cold water, one need not make an effort to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Though some people have reservations about performing <em>hagala</em> on their utensils, the procedure is actually quite simple. In brief: First, one
    cleans the utensil and waits twenty-four hours after it absorbed forbidden food. Next, one immerses the utensil in boiling water. If it is possible to take
    it out and rinse it immediately in cold water, this should be done, but if it is difficult, one may extinguish the fire under the pot of boiling water,
wait for the pot to cool down somewhat, and then pour out the hot water, and rinse the utensil a bit in cold water. One may use any pot in the kitchen for    <em>hagala</em>, provided that it has not been used for cooking in the previous twenty-four hours.

13. Koshering Pots via <em>Hagala</em>/strong>
</h2>
<p>
    We have seen that in order to kosher a pot used to cook <em>hametz</em> (barley soup, for instance), it must be immersed in boiling water. When the boiling
    water inundates the vessel on all sides, it extracts the taste of the <em>hametz</em> from it. Based on the principle of <em>ke-bole'o kakh polto</em>, it
    ought to be possible to kosher such a pot by simply boiling water in it, and the pot will expel the taste just as it absorbed it. However, during the
    course of the year some cooked foods certainly boiled over the sides of the pot, causing the absorption of taste along the pot's rim. The taste would not
    be released by water boiled inside the pot. Thus, in order to kosher such a pot for Pesah, it must be completely immersed in a large vat of boiling water.
</p>
<p>
    If one cannot find a vat large enough for immersing the pot one wishes to kosher, the <em>poskim</em> suggest the following: fill the pot you wish to
    kosher with water and bring it to a boil. At the same time, heat a stone so that it becomes scorching hot. When the water boils, insert the scorching hot
    stone into the pot. This will cause a lot of water to spill over the sides of the pot, koshering its rim and its outer walls.
</p>
<p>
    This method is effective where a vessel has absorbed <em>hametz </em>through overflow, but if a pot was inserted into another pot and absorbed taste, it
    has absorbed in a <em>kli</em> <em>rishon</em>, and <em>hagala</em> by the overflow method is not effective. Instead, it must be koshered through complete
    immersion in boiling water (SA 452:6; MB <em>ad loc. </em>31).
</p>
<p>
    It is difficult, however, to heat stones in this manner in domestic kitchens. Therefore, a possible alternative is to boil water in a small vessel, and
    when the water in the large vessel begins to boil, insert the small vessel into the center of the larger vessel. This will cause the water in the larger
    vessel to overflow and kosher its rim and outer walls.
</p>
<p>
    If the pots have removable handles, it is proper to remove them and perform <em>hagala </em>on them. However, if the handles were not removed, and one
    cleaned around them with plenty of soap and then performed <em>hagala </em>on them, the pot is kosher.
</p>
<p>
    Another problem is that many pots have a lip along the rim and on the edges of the cover where food sometimes gets stuck. The preferred practice is to heat
    these areas with a blowtorch in order to incinerate the residue found there. However, one need not be meticulous about this, because the pot goes through
    enough rinsing and cleaning with detergents to render the taste of any residual food foul and unfit for a dog's consumption, so that it does not even have
    the status of <em>hametz</em>. Therefore, if a blowtorch is used, its flame should not be directed at one place for too long, because doing so might damage
    the pot's nice appearance. When necessary, one who cannot perform light <em>libun </em>on this lip may suffice with <em>hagala</em>.

14. Absorption through Pickling ("<em>Kvisha</em>") and Its Koshering
</h2>
<p>
    Utensils into which cold <em>hametz</em> has been placed do not require <em>hagala</em> in boiling water; a thorough washing is sufficient to kosher them
for Pesah. For example, beer mugs become kosher for Pesah by means of a thorough washing, even though beer is <em>hametz gamur</em>, because as long as the    <em>hametz</em> in a utensil has not reached the temperature of <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em>, the utensil does not absorb the taste of its contents.
    Certainly, then, a cake plate used for <em>hametz </em>can be koshered for Pesah with a thorough washing, because in addition to the fact that cookies
    never reach <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em>, they are dry, and taste does not transfer to a utensil without a liquid medium.
</p>
<p>
    But if beer is left in a mug for more than twenty-four hours, <em>kvisha </em>("pickling," or the absorption of taste through prolonged soaking) occurs,
    and the taste of the <em>hametz</em> gets absorbed into the glass based on the Sages' rule: "<em>kavush ke-mevushal</em>" (pickling is akin to cooking).
    Therefore, it is forbidden to use such a utensil on Pesah unless it has been koshered.
</p>
<p>
    Utensils that have absorbed taste via <em>kvisha</em> can certainly be koshered through <em>hagala</em> in boiling water; if <em>hagala</em> is effective
    on utensils that absorbed via cooking, it certainly works on utensils that absorbed via <em>kvisha</em>. Moreover, since <em>kvisha </em>is a milder form
    of absorption, one may kosher such a utensil by soaking it in water for three twenty-four hour periods: First, one places the utensil in water and leaves
    it there for twenty-four hours. Second, the water is changed and the utensil is left there for another twenty-four hours. Then the water is changed once
    again, and the utensil soaks for a final twenty-four-hour period. Nevertheless, this method of koshering is generally not helpful because it is faster and
    easier to perform <em>hagala</em> with boiling water. But when dealing with utensils that are liable to be damaged by boiling water, soaking in water for
    three twenty-four-hour periods can be a very useful solution.
</p>
<p>
It is also worth mentioning that when it comes to alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, some <em>poskim</em> are of the opinion that the taste of the    <em>hametz</em> is absorbed by the glass in a mere eighteen minutes. Thus, if one wishes to use such a glass on Pesah, it must first be koshered using one
    of the aforementioned methods.

            . It is impossible to measure how much taste the walls of a pot absorb and how much they release back into the food; some vessels absorb more than
            others do, and some tastes are more easily absorbed than others. Since this is a persistent uncertainty with no means of resolution, the Sages
            determined that one should consider the entire wall of the pot to be completely filled with the taste of whatever is cooked inside of it. Thus, if
            one cooked non-kosher meat in a pot and then cooked kosher meat in the same pot, we assume that the walls of the pot absorbed taste from the
            non-kosher meat and subsequently discharged the taste back into the kosher meat. And since our pots and utensils do not hold sixty times the amount
            that can be absorbed into the walls of the pot, anything that was cooked in a pot that had previously absorbed the taste of a prohibited food
            becomes prohibited. Even if one cooked another piece of kosher meat afterward, it too would become prohibited, since perhaps not all of the
            absorbed forbidden taste was released during the first usage and was released during the second usage. In sum: in the case of a perpetual
            uncertainty where it is impossible to determine absolutely how much taste was absorbed and how much was released, we are stringent.

fire alone causes the <em>hametz</em> to be absorbed." <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>139 cites them, and this is the ruling of            <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> 1:7 (although <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 451:76 states that if there was enough liquid present in the pot to wet something that
            touched something that was in the pot ("<em>tofei'ah al menat le-hatfi'ah</em>"),<em> </em>the pot can be koshered by <em>hagala</em>; this

            is no sizzling liquid (see <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim Le-Pesah</em> 5:23 and the supplementary material <em>ad loc.</em>). If a pot is generally
            used to cook through a liquid medium but less frequently used to make jachnun or kugel, it may be koshered by <em>hagala </em>in extenuating

            . BHL<em> </em>451:11 concludes that most <em>poskim</em> maintain that one may kosher a frying pan via <em>hagala</em>, and I have already
            mentioned the leading Rishonim on this topic. SA YD<em> </em>121:4 rules that a frying pan generally requires <em>libun </em>to be koshered from
            forbidden foods, but for Pesah <em>hagala </em>is sufficient. Many Aharonim (Gra and <em>Shakh ad loc.</em>)<em> </em>explain that regarding Pesah
            R. Karo combines the opinion that <em>hagala </em>is sufficient with the view that <em>hametz</em> before Pesah is considered permissible, and thus
            rules leniently that one may kosher a frying pan for Pesah via <em>hagala</em>. Rema agrees in principle but states that light <em>libun </em>is
the proper method <em>le-khathila</em>. Later Aharonim also disagree about this issue: <em>Pri Hadash</em> and R. Hayim ibn Attar require<em>libun </em>since <em>hametz </em>is considered a forbidden substance even before Pesah, while SAH permits using <em>hagala </em>even            <em>le-khathila</em>. See <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim Le-Pesah</em> 13:202.

            I have written that the preferable method for koshering a frying pan is light <em>libun</em>, and although apparently light <em>libun </em>is
            ineffective according to those who require heavy <em>libun</em>, there are in fact those who maintain that light <em>libun</em><em> </em>is as
            effective as heavy <em>libun</em> (this may be the opinion of R. Avigdor, quoted in the <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em>)<em>.</em> Additionally, some

            in the next section. Consequently, light <em>libun</em><em> </em>is sufficient, since it takes place at least at the same temperature as the
            initial absorption. On the other hand, it is better to use light <em>libun </em>since sometimes there are small grooves or cracks in the pan which
are difficult to clean, in which case even those who maintain that <em>hagala</em><em> </em>is enough to kosher a frying pan would require            <em>libun </em>to eradicate the residue in the cracks. However, one may rely, <em>be-di'avad</em>, on the majority of <em>poskim</em> who maintain
            that one may kosher a frying pan via <em>hagala</em>, especially since once twenty-four hours have elapsed since its last use, any uncertainty

            . The basis for the distinction between utensils that absorbed permissible matter (<em>heteira bala</em>) and those that absorbed forbidden matter
            (<em>isura bala</em>) is explained in AZ 86a. The idea is that <em>hagala</em> releases most of the taste that is absorbed in the utensil. Thus, if
the utensil absorbed forbidden taste, all of the taste must be eliminated from the utensil since the utensil became subject to a presumption (            <em>hazaka</em>) of being forbidden. On the other hand, when the taste absorbed in the utensil was permitted at the time of absorption, there is no
            need to extract the weakened taste that remains after <em>hagala</em>. This distinction was subject to the discretion of the Sages since, after
            twenty-four hours, the taste absorbed in the walls of the utensil befouls the food instead of improving it and must only be extracted due to
            rabbinic injunction. Therefore, the Sages did not require this extraction when permissible taste was absorbed. According to this, we may only be
            lenient in a case of <em>heteira bala </em>once twenty-four hours have elapsed since the utensil absorbed the permitted taste. See also R.
            Pfeiffer's <em>Kitzur </em>SA<em>, Basar Be-halav</em> vol. 2 explanation 9 for an examination of other explanations.

. This law is explained very well in R. Pfeiffer's <em>Kitzur </em>SA<em>, Basar Be-halav</em> vol. 2, ch. 2, based on            <em>Responsa Rama Mi-Fano</em> �96 and <em>Hatam Sofer </em>YD �110. See also <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 451:70, which lists the opinions and tended
            toward requiring light <em>libun </em>if it would not ruin the utensil, even though many authorities rule leniently that <em>hagala</em> is
sufficient. See <em>Kitzur </em>SA<em> </em>(<em>op. cit. </em>ch. 12 nn. 7 and 10) for a discussion of the possibility of performing light<em>libun</em> in a pastry oven. It also seems that we can be lenient and allow light <em>libun</em> in an oven by factoring in the opinion that            <em>ke-bole'o kakh polto </em>is a function of temperature, and the fact that the oven becomes an uncertainty about a rabbinic law after
            twenty-four hours. Thus, light <em>libun </em>koshers an oven even <em>le-khathila</em>.<u></u>

            . <em>Pri Megadim</em> explains (<em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> �452) that one may perform <em>libun</em> on a utensil that might become partially
            damaged. <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 8:40 and <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em> 5:6 and 13:315 state that one should not kosher baking trays
            using <em>libun</em>. Although it is possible to use baking trays that have undergone <em>libun</em><em>, </em>most people nowadays prefer to throw
            them out. The question is whether the law is different for one who is unfazed by a warped baking tray (as per <em>Pri Megadim</em>). Perhaps
            someone whose baking tray became non-kosher - meaning that unless he koshers it he will have to throw it out anyway - may perform <em>libun </em>on
            it, for if he does not like the way it looks afterward he will simply throw it out. Some authorities rule leniently in this regard, but I am
            inclined to be stringent unless it is absolutely necessary. In extenuating circumstances, perhaps one may rely on <em>Arugot Ha-bosem</em>, cited
            in n. 5.

            . A <em>kli rishon </em>on the flame must always be koshered in boiling water. Whether its temperature was just barely <em>yad soledet </em>or
            beyond the boiling point at the time of the absorption, all absorption in a utensil on the fire is treated uniformly and the utensil must always be
            koshered in boiling water. This principle is explained beautifully in R. Pfeiffer's <em>Kitzur </em>SA<em>, Basar Be-halav</em> vol. 2. However,
            some authorities maintain that even a utensil sitting on the fire is subject to the standard principle of <em>ke-bole'o kakh polto</em>, meaning
that if it absorbed taste at 80�C it releases the taste at the same temperature. See <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 1:4, SAH 451, and            <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> <em>ad loc. </em>82.
        </p>
        <p>
Regarding a <em>kli rishon </em>not on the flame, most <em>poskim</em> agree that the koshering process must be done at a temperature of<em>yad soledet bo</em>, as stated in MA<em> </em>OH <em> </em>451:7, <em>Pri Hadash</em> 452:3, and <em>Pri Megadim </em>451 (            <em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 9). However, <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 1:4 mentions opinions that the koshering temperature must be the same as
            the absorption temperature, so to avoid uncertainty it is best to kosher such a utensil in boiling water. The temperature of <em>yad soledet</em>
            is uncertain, somewhere between 45�C and 71�C (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</em> 1:10:7), so to kosher a utensil, the water must be at least
            71�C. On the other hand, if the utensil was used at a temperature of at least 45�C, there is concern that absorption took place and therefore one
            should be stringent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that a <em>kli sheini </em>does not absorb, but due to the stringent nature of the prohibition of <em>hametz</em>,
            they mandated <em>hagala</em>. <em>Be-di'avad</em>, if the utensil was not koshered and was later inserted into hot food, the food is not forbidden
            (MB 451:11). The vast majority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that a <em>kli shlishi</em> does not absorb at all. Even so, several authorities insist
that every utensil, even ten times removed from the fire, must be koshered if its contents reached the temperature of <em>yad soledet</em> (            <em>Pri Hadash</em>). See <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim </em>5:52. This is the <em>le-khathila </em>practice.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
We should also note that the <em>poskim</em> disagree about the status of a solid food ("<em>davar gush</em>")<em> </em>at the temperature of<em>yad soledet</em>: According to Rabbeinu Yona<em>, </em>Me'iri<em>, </em>Maharshal<em>, </em>Shakh, and MA, even if it is in a<em>kli shlishi</em>, the food has the status of a <em>kli rishon</em> removed from the flame, since it retains its heat. Conversely, according to<em>Tosafot, </em>Ran<em>, </em>Rema<em>, </em>and<em> </em>Gra<em>,</em> the food assumes the status of the utensil that contains it. Regarding            <em>hagala</em>, the custom is to kosher such utensils in boiling water on the fire.

            . Among the authorities who rule leniently and allow one to kosher utensils based on main usage: Rif<em>, </em>Rambam<em>, </em>Ran<em>, </em>and
            Rashba. The authorities who require koshering based on the most intense usage are: <em>She'iltot, </em>Rashi<em>, Tosafot, </em>and Raavya. These
            groups disagree about <em>hametz</em> as well as other prohibitions. There is another reason to be stringent regarding <em>hametz</em> alone:
            According to Rema 447:10, even <em>hametz</em> that contributes foul taste (<em>noten ta'am li-fgam</em>)<em> </em>renders other foods forbidden;
            therefore, one must perform the most intense form of <em>hagala </em>on such a pot. On the other hand, regarding absorption that takes place due to
            fire, there is a reason to be lenient, namely, there is an opinion that a pot that absorbs <em>hametz</em> before Pesah is considered to have
            absorbed permissible matter (<em>heteira bala</em>). We calculate majority and minority usage based on use with <em>hametz </em>that requires
koshering; in other words, a utensil that is primarily used for cold permitted food and was used once for hot <em>hametz </em>must undergo            <em>hagala </em>in boiling water. However, if most of the <em>hametz </em>usage was cold, as in the case of a table or countertop, it can be
            cleaned with cold water according to SA, even though it was occasionally used with hot <em>hametz</em> (<em>Hazon Ish </em>OH <em> </em>119:15; and
            see <em>Hagalat Kelim</em> 4:8-17). Since we know that <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim</em> (451:100 and 107) states that the preferable custom is to be
stringent and kosher the utensil according to its minority usage, and Rema and MB<em> </em>also state that one may only rely on the lenient opinion            <em>be-di'avad </em>(see SHT <em>ad loc. </em>144 and <em>Hagalat Kelim </em>4 n. 18, against the implication of SAH 451:28 and 33, that this
            leniency is only <em>be-di'avad</em>),<em> </em>I have written that preferably one should be stringent and follow the minority usage, but in
            extenuating circumstances one may be lenient. This is true according to all customs. Regarding forks that are sometimes used in fire, there is an
            additional reason to be lenient and require only <em>hagala </em>- the fork that was used in the fire is <em>batel </em>in the majority of forks
            that were not.

. Obviously, once the food residue in the crevices absorbs the taste of the soap, it is no longer edible and thus no longer forbidden (see also            <em>Hagala</em><em>t Kelim</em> 6:4). This seems problematic, though, as MA 451:5, <em>Taz</em>, and many other Aharonim state that knives
            comprised of two pieces cannot be koshered due to the food residue that is stuck in the groove between the pieces. They did not raise the option of
            simply befouling the taste of the food stuck in between. Perhaps a distinction can be drawn between the crevices that are near the food and grooves
            that are further away, like where the handle connects with the utensil (see SAH 451:21, which makes this distinction when <em>be-di'avad </em>one
            forgot to kosher the handle of a utensil). In truth, even the case of the knife needs further examination, since the reason for the rabbinic
            prohibition against using a utensil even twenty-four hours after absorbing prohibited matter is so that one will not mistakenly use a utensil
            within twenty-four hours of the absorption. However, the Sages did not include the food stuck in the grooves in this prohibition, and if this food
            is not fit for a dog's consumption, it is no longer considered <em>hametz</em>. Perhaps one need not take the words of the Aharonim literally;
rather, they just meant to teach that when the utensil has nicks and grooves that may have trapped <em>hametz</em>, simply performing            <em>hagala </em>is insufficient. This matter requires further examination.

            . Regarding a pot in which one cooked prohibited food, if it is known that the pot did not boil over and its handles did not become hot, there is
            no need to kosher the handles. It is sufficient to boil water inside the pot, as will be explained below (section 13). Additionally, if the handles
            got hot but are attached to the pot with screws, they do not have to be koshered, since taste does not transfer from metal to metal. Similarly, if
            one accidentally put a dairy spoon into a meat pot, one must only kosher the section of the spoon that was submerged in the pot and the section
            that got hot, but not the rest. However, one must kosher the handles of a <em>hametz</em> pot, since there is a concern that perhaps during the
            year some <em>hametz</em> splattered onto the handles. Similarly, if one wants to kosher a <em>hametz</em> spoon, he must perform <em>hagala </em>
            on the entire thing; see MB<em> </em>451:68.

            . These principles are explained in SA<em> </em>453:1-2 and in MB 1 <em>ad loc</em>. One who wishes to perform <em>hagala </em>must ensure that one
            of two conditions is met: 1) the utensil is not <em>ben yomo</em>, rendering any absorbed taste foul and thus incapable of rendering the utensil
forbidden, even if reabsorbed; 2) the boiling water is sixty times the volume of the utensil's walls, so that any taste released into the water is            <em>batel be-shishim</em>. If many utensils are undergoing <em>hagala</em>, clearly the water will not have sixty times the volume of all the
            utensils collectively, so the custom is to kosher only utensils that are not <em>ben yomo</em>, lest the water have less than sixty times the
            volume of the utensils' walls (Rema 452:2 and MB<em> </em>20 <em>ad loc.</em>). These rules pertain to any forbidden food absorbed into a utensil,
except for <em>hametz</em>. Regarding <em>hametz</em>, SA<em> </em>452:1 states that if one boils a <em>hametz</em> utensil before the            <em>hametz</em> actually becomes forbidden, <em>hagala</em> is effective even if the utensil is <em>ben yomo</em>, and even if the quantity of
            boiled water is less than sixty times that of the utensil walls, since the <em>hametz</em> was permitted at the time of its absorption. The only
            reason the utensil needs to be koshered is that it contains the taste of <em>hametz</em><em> </em>in its walls, and taste that is released into
            boiling water and then reabsorbed into the utensil is not sufficient reason to require the utensil to undergo <em>hagala </em>again, as the
            reabsorbed taste is already twice removed from the original food (<em>noten ta'am bar noten ta'am</em>, or <em>nat bar nat</em>). One need only
            take care not to kosher <em>ben yomo </em>meat and dairy utensils together. Many questioned this ruling of SA, since in 451:4 it states that one
must kosher utensils using <em>libun</em> if they absorbed <em>hametz</em> by fire, which means that SA follows those who maintain that            <em>hametz</em> before Pesah is considered "<em>isura bala.</em>" How, then, can it state in 452:4 that <em>hametz</em> before Pesah is considered
            "<em>heteira bala</em>"? Indeed, <em>Olat Shabbat, Pri Hadash</em>, and <em>Bi'ur Ha-Gra</em> maintain that even when koshering a <em>hametz</em>
            utensil before the onset of the prohibition of <em>hametz</em>, one must ensure either that the utensil is not <em>ben yomo </em>or that there is
            enough water that anything absorbed in the walls of the utensil is <em>batel be-shishim</em>. This is the custom that is followed. (Perhaps,
            though, we can solve SA's apparent contradiction as follows: <em>Hagala</em> addresses a situation of <em>nat bar nat bar nat</em>, in which the
taste is thrice removed from its origins. Thus, SA<em> </em>felt it was appropriate to rely on the lenient opinion. But in the <em>libun</em>            <em> </em>case, the taste is only once removed from its origins, so SA<em> </em>ruled stringently.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding whether one may perform <em>hagala</em> on Pesah: According to SA, it is permissible as long as the utensil is not <em>ben yomo</em>;
            merely having enough water is insufficient, since on Pesah <em>hametz</em> is not <em>batel be-shishim</em>. According to Rema (447:10), even a
            drop of foul-tasting <em>hametz </em>renders forbidden whatever absorbs it on Pesah. Thus, there is no permissible method of <em>hagala</em> on
            Pesah. Only <em>libun</em>, which incinerates the taste absorbed in the utensil, is permitted on Pesah<em>.</em>

            <em>Le-khathila</em>
            , no other substance is mixed with the water used for <em>hagala</em>, as explained in Rema 452:5. <em>Be-di'avad</em>, <em>hagala</em> is
            effective in any liquid. MB <em>ad loc. </em>26 states in the name of <em>Pri Megadim</em> that if Pesah had not yet begun, one should re-kosher
the utensil in boiling water alone. Nevertheless, in communal <em>hagala</em> it is difficult to ensure that everyone's utensils are not            <em>ben yomo</em>, and since we want to avoid any problems that could arise from mixing meat and dairy utensils, the custom is to add soap or
            bleach to the boiling water. See <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 7:20, which states that the validity of the <em>hagala</em> only comes into
            question if the water becomes thickened from the added substances. In n. 7 <em>ad loc. </em>it states in the name of <em>Hazon Ish</em> that it is
            preferable to use cleaning fluids to avoid the potential problem of mixing milk and meat and to avoid relying on the opinion that <em>hametz</em>
            before Pesah is considered "<em>isura bala.</em>"

            . See SA 452:1 and MB <em>ad loc.</em> 4, which state that one should not leave the utensils in the water for too long, so that they do not
            reabsorb what they released. On the other hand, too short a time in the water will not give the utensils enough time to release. MB states that it
            is difficult to ascertain the precise amount of time that is neither too quick nor too long. However, it states: "If one performs <em>hagala </em>
            before the time that [<em>hametz</em>] becomes forbidden, there is no need to be so precise, and one may leave [the utensils] in the water longer,"
            since at that point <em>noten ta'am li-fgam </em>is permitted and the <em>hametz </em>is <em>batel be-shishim</em>. See <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 452:2
            which states that some Rishonim<em> </em>maintain that one should leave the utensils in the water until they have released what they absorbed,
            while other Rishonim<em> </em>maintain that one should insert the utensils in the water and then remove them immediately. Common practice follows
the latter opinion, and <em>Pri Hadash</em> states, regarding this practice, that Jewish custom has attained the status of law (see            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 7:17 and n. 67). The prevalent custom is to leave the utensils in the boiling water for about three seconds.

            . The custom of Ashkenazic communities and some Sephardic communities is to avoid using <em>hagala</em> to switch utensils from meat to dairy and
            vice versa, so that one does not forget which utensils are meat and which are dairy. However, if a utensil became non-kosher and one koshered it
through <em>hagala</em>, he may use it for whatever he wants (if it was meat before, he may use it for dairy and vice versa). Similarly,            <em>Hatam Sofer</em> �101 states that following the <em>hagala</em> for Pesah, one may change the status of his utensils. One who receives a
            utensil as a gift may change its status through <em>hagala</em> (<em>Darkhei Teshuva</em> YD 121:59). One may also sell the utensil to a friend,
            reacquire it, and then change its status through <em>hagala.</em> (<em>Pri Megadim</em> [<em>Eshel Avraham</em>] 452:13, states that in extenuating
            circumstances one may change the status of his utensils through <em>hagala</em>.)

. We once examined the lip of a pot, and the substance contained in it was black, ugly, and extremely foul-tasting. Therefore, even without            <em>libun</em> it is not forbidden. Similarly, whatever builds up around the pot handles is exceedingly foul, so even if one did not remove the
handles, the <em>hagala</em> is valid. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, one should rinse that area with a lot of soap. Regarding            <em>hagala </em>on a large pot that does not fit inside an even larger pot, I have seen it suggested that one cause the water to overflow by
            pouring boiling water into it from an electric kettle that is still connected to a power source. My solution is better, though, since with the
            pouring method, the water cools down slightly, whereas in my method, the whole pot boils and becomes a <em>kli rishon</em> without cooling down at
            all.

            <strong>Regarding milk and meat:</strong>
            Sometimes some liquid from a boiling dairy pot splashes onto a cold meat pot, and we consider the outer layer of the meat pot to have absorbed some
            dairy taste at the spot that was hit by the liquid. The way to kosher the meat pot is by pouring boiling water on it, and since we are dealing with
            a very small absorption, one need not even wait twenty-four hours, since it is possible to pour sixty times the amount absorbed on the spot. If one
            is concerned that there is not sixty times the absorbed amount, he may mix soap into the boiling water, which will befoul the absorbed taste. On
            the other hand, if the meat pot contained hot food when it was splashed by the dairy liquid, the pot needs to be koshered in boiling water. One
            should consult with a halakhic authority about the status of the food in the meat pot, since sometimes it is sufficient to have sixty times the
            amount of dairy liquid, while other times there needs to be 3,600 (sixty times sixty) times the amount of splashed liquid.

. See <em>Kaf Ha-hayim </em>YD 105:1 on the dispute among the <em>poskim</em> regarding the degree to which, vis-a-vis prohibitions other than            <em>hametz</em>, utensils absorb taste via the pickling process. Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that utensils absorb taste via pickling to the same
degree that they do via cooking, while others maintain that pickling causes utensils to absorb taste only in their outermost layers. <em>Kaf</em>            <em> Ha-hayim</em> concludes that one may rely on the lenient opinions to prevent a significant financial loss. For example, if one cooked in a pot
            that had previously contained prohibited liquids for a period of twenty-four hours, one may rely on the lenient opinions that permit the food,
            since the amount absorbed in the outermost layer of the pot is not sufficient to prohibit the food. On the other hand, when not dealing with a
            significant loss, one should be stringent, following the many authorities that consider the food forbidden. It is clear that one preferably should
not use utensils that have had prohibited liquid in them for more than twenty-four hours. Regarding the pickling time for a sharp food,            <em>Darkhei Teshuva</em> 105:42 states that there is a dispute: some say it takes ten minutes (<em>Yad Yehuda</em>) and others say eighteen minutes
(<em>Tiferet Yisrael</em>). It is also uncertain whether these times apply to absorption into a utensil as well. <em>Nishmat Adam</em> 57:10 and            <em>Binat Adam</em> �59 state that, according to <em>Shakh</em>, even the taste of a sharp food is only absorbed into a utensil after twenty-four
hours, while according to MA the taste of sharp foods is absorbed more quickly. Preferably, one should be stringent. See            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 6:5.

        <p align="left">
            Even though an earthenware utensil that absorbed <em>hametz</em> during the cooking process cannot be koshered through <em>hagala</em>, if such a
utensil absorbed the taste through the pickling process, it can be koshered through <em>hagala</em> or through soaking for three days, as per SA            <em> </em>451:21. See also MB <em>ad loc.</em> 118 and <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 242, which state in the name of <em>Shakh</em><em> </em>YD 135:33 that
            the leniency of permitting one to kosher an earthenware vessel that absorbed forbidden taste via pickling applies only to <em>hametz </em>and not
            to other forbidden foods.
