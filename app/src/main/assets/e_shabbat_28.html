        Chapter 28 - Illness That Is Not Life-Threatening<em></em>
    </h1>
    <a name="1"></a><h2>
        1. Principles of the <em>Halakhot </em>of Sick People
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are three categories of sick people according to <em>halakha</em>
        :
    </p>
    <p>
        1) a gravely ill person - one whose life is in danger;
    </p>
    <p>
        2) a "regular" sick person<em> </em>- one whose whole body is ill but
        whose life is not in danger;
    </p>
    <p>
        3) a "mildly" sick person - one who is ailing in part of his body or
        who experiences pain from a bodily ailment.
    </p>
    <p>
        When caring for a dangerously sick person, one does everything on
        Shabbat that he would do during the week. All Shabbat prohibitions are
        overridden in order to save a life, as we saw in the previous chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
        When caring for a regular sick person - one who is sick enough that he
        is forced to lie down, but whose life is not in danger - one may
        disregard rabbinic prohibitions, but Torah prohibitions remain in force
        (as will be explained in the next section).

    </p>
    <p>
        A mildly sick person or one who is bothered by ailments - that is, one
        who can walk around as though healthy, but experiences discomfort from
        a mild ailment - is subject to all rabbinic laws, and one may not even
        violate <em>shvut di-shvut</em> on his behalf. However, if he is in
        pain, one may do certain things for him even though they are
        categorized as <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. Specifically, one may ask a
        non-Jew to transgress a rabbinic prohibition for him, or a Jew may make
        use of a <em>shinui</em> to do so (SA 307:5; MB 328:3; above 9:11).
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a specific rabbinic enactment forbidding a mildly sick person
        to take medicine. The <em>poskim</em> disagree whether this prohibition
        pertains to today’s medications, which are factory-made (the laws
        pertaining to one bothered by a mild ailment will be explained in
        sections 3-5).
    </p>
    <p>
        The main idea of Shabbat is that on this day we calmly and tranquilly
        accept reality as it is. If we have no clean clothes, we wear dirty
        ones. If we forgot to cook a certain dish, we content ourselves with
        the food we have, or we ask a neighbor for help. If we forgot to turn
        on the heat, we put on a coat. If we forgot to turn on the air
        conditioning, we suffer a bit from the heat. Even though Shabbat laws
        sometimes cause suffering, they liberate us from the burden and tension
        of having to pay constant attention and ensure that every little detail
        of our lives is properly addressed. Therefore, Shabbat is a valuable
        gift. The feeling of faith, tranquility, and rest that results from
        accepting reality on Shabbat is enjoyable and uplifting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sages continue this trend through their enactments, one of which is
        to refrain from using medicine on Shabbat. If we experience some
        discomfort, even if it is irritating and unpleasant, we bear it calmly,
        as this too is part of Shabbat rest. However, if the discomfort causes
        pain and negates <em>oneg Shabbat</em>, the Sages permitted
        transgressing minor rabbinic prohibitions (<em>shvut di-shvut</em>) to
        relieve the suffering. And when it comes to caring for one who is
        actually sick, the Sages allow us to transgress all rabbinic
        prohibitions, as taking care of one’s health is a mitzva.
    </p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>
        2. A Regular Sick Person
    </h2>
    <p>
        As is well known, there are two types of Shabbat prohibitions: Torah
prohibitions and rabbinic prohibitions (the latter type is also called        <em>shvut</em>). There is a principle that one desecrates Shabbat and
        performs even <em>melakhot</em> prohibited by Torah law on behalf of a
        gravely ill person, someone whose life is in danger. In contrast, when
        caring for someone who is ill but whose life is not in danger, one may
        not violate Torah prohibitions. However, the Sages permitted the
        violation of prohibitions that they themselves enacted to treat someone
        who is sick.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who is bedridden due to his illness is considered a regular sick
        person. Even if, for some reason, he is not actually lying down, he is
        considered sick as long as this is the type of illness that generally
        causes people to lie down. Similarly, if one is suffering from pain
        that weakens his entire body (for example, a migraine), he is
        considered a sick person, even if he has not actually gone to lie down
        (SA 328:17). Furthermore, even if one is walking around and looks well,
        if it is clear that without a particular treatment he will need to lie
        down, one may transgress rabbinic prohibitions to prevent this from
        happening (SSK 33:1). If a child needs something very badly, he is
        considered a sick person, even if he has not gone to lie down (Rema
        328:17; MB 276:6; above 24:6).
    </p>
    <p>
The easiest and most accepted way of taking care of a sick person        <em> </em>is with the help of a non-Jew. As we have seen (above 25:1),
        under normal circumstances the Sages prohibited asking a non-Jew to
        undertake <em>melakha</em> on behalf of a Jew on Shabbat, but they
permitted doing so for the sake of a sick person<em> </em>(        <em>Shabbat</em> 129a). Therefore, one may ask a non-Jew to turn a
        light on or off for a sick person, to turn a heater on for him, to cook
        food for him, to travel in order to bring him medication, to press
        elevator buttons for him, and to administer X-rays for him. Similarly,
        one may ask a non-Jewish dentist to treat a patient whose toothache is
        causing him pain that extends throughout his body. One may ask a
        non-Jewish doctor to write a prescription for a sick person. One may
        ask a non-Jew to drive a sick person to the doctor or to the hospital.
        In such a case, a Jew may accompany the patient, on condition that
        neither he nor the sick person<em> </em>performs any <em>melakha</em>
        themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        A regular sick person<em> </em>may take whatever medications he needs,
        since the rabbinic prohibition against taking medicine applies only to
        a mildly sick person<em> </em>(Rema 328:37; see BHL <em>ad loc.</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        If no non-Jew is available, according to Ran, a Jew may not transgress
        rabbinic prohibitions for a sick person. According to Rashba, however,
he may, and we follow this position in practice. However,        <em>le-khatĥila</em>, if possible, it is still preferable to arrange
for a non-Jew to do whatever is necessary, or for a Jew to use a<em>shinui</em>, so that the prohibition will be reduced to a        <em>shvut di-shvut</em> (above, 9:11). If there is no choice, and the
        sick person<em> </em>desperately needs care, a Jew may do rabbinically
        prohibited <em>melakhot</em> on his behalf. For example, if he needs a
        light turned on or off, one should do this with a <em>shinui</em> such
        as using one’s arm or leg, so that the prohibition is only rabbinic
        (above, 9:3). Similarly, if the sick person<em> </em>needs a heater or
air conditioner turned on or off, one may do this with a        <em>shinui</em>.

    </p>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>
        3. A Mildly Sick Person and One Experiencing Discomfort
    </h2>
    <p>
        If one walks around and seems to be healthy, but in fact is mildly sick
        or experiencing discomfort, his status is the same as that of anyone
        else. He must observe all the Shabbat prohibitions, including the
        rabbinic ones. The permission to transgress rabbinic prohibitions (as
        explained in the previous section) is for a regular sick person, but
        this permission does not extend to one who is bothered by a mild
        illness or ailment. Therefore, if the light is bothering him, one may
        not ask a non-Jew to turn it off; if he needs light, heat, or air
        conditioning, one may not ask a non-Jew to turn them on. Even asking a
        non-Jew to do these things with a <em>shinui</em> - which would reduce
        the prohibition to a <em>shvut di-shvut</em> - is prohibited, because
        all rabbinic prohibitions still apply to him (SA 328:1).
    </p>
    <p>
        All of this applies in a case where the illness is merely irritating
        and uncomfortable. However, if the illness or ailment causes pain, one
        may relieve it by performing a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. If the person
        suffering has a great need for light, heat, or air conditioning, one
        may ask a non-Jew to turn them on using a <em>shinui</em>, such as with
        his arm. However, a Jew may not do so even with a <em>shinui</em>,
because there would still be a standard rabbinic prohibition (        <em>shvut</em>), which applies even when there is some pain (SA 307:5;
        328:25; above 9:11-12; <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one’s fingernail has been torn off most of the way and is
        bothersome, this is considered an ailment, and one may not remove the
        nail even via a <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. However, if the torn nail is
        painful, one may remove it using a <em>shinui</em>, such as with one’s
        hand or teeth. Since most of the nail has already been torn off, it is
        viewed as if it has already fallen off, so the prohibition to tear it
        off completely is only rabbinic. For this reason, the Sages permitted
removing a nail with a <em>shinui</em> if it is causing pain (        <em>Shabbat</em> 94b; SA 328:31; above, 14:2). If the nail was not torn
        off most of the way but is painful, one may ask a non-Jew to remove it
with a <em>shinui</em>, since doing so reduces the prohibition to a        <em>shvut di-shvut</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if a splinter becomes embedded in a person’s skin and it is
        clear that removing it will cause bleeding, one may not remove it if it
        is merely irritating. However, if it is painful, one may remove it,
since the prohibition of causing bleeding in this way is only a        <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, as one does not intend to cause bleeding, and
        the bleeding is effected via a <em>shinui</em>, as a side effect of
        removing the thorn (see MB 328:88; above, ch. 9 n. 3 and 14:2).
    </p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>
        4. The Enactment Against Medicine - Grinding Ingredients
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Sages further enacted that one who is bothered by an ailment or
        mild illness may not obtain medical treatment on Shabbat. That is, he
        may not ingest medicine, apply a medicinal ointment, or take any
        actions designed for the purpose of healing. The concern is that one
        who is preoccupied with alleviating the ailment will pulverize herbal
        ingredients to prepare a medication and thereby violate the Torah
        prohibition of <em>Toĥen</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 54b and Rashi).
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the Sages forbade someone with an eye ailment to drip wine or
        another medication to his eye (SA 328:20). Similarly, one may not apply
        ointment to a wound to heal it (SA 328:22). If one has a sore throat,
        he may not gargle with oil for therapeutic purposes. One who has a
        toothache may not rinse his teeth and gums with vinegar, salt water, or
        alcohol for therapeutic purposes. However, he may drink an alcoholic
        beverage in order to relieve the pain, on condition that he does not
        retain the liquid in his mouth longer than usual (SA 328:32).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the ailment causes pain, one may ask a non-Jew to drip wine to his
        eye or apply alcohol to his painful tooth. This reduces the prohibition
        to the level of <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, which the Sages permitted if
        one is in pain (SA 307:5; 328:25; above, 9:11-12 and <em>Harĥavot</em>;
        according to Radbaz and R. Mordechai Benet, a Jew in pain may take
        medicine by himself; see n. 3 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        The enactment prohibiting taking medicine also includes eating or
        drinking items that only sick people eat or drink. However, a sick
        person may eat or drink items that healthy people eat or drink as well,
even if his intention is to use these items as medicine (        <em>Shabbat</em> 109b; SA 328:37). Therefore, one who has a sore throat
        may not suck on throat lozenges, but he may suck on ordinary hard
        candies (SSK 34:4). Similarly, one may not drink water with flaxseed to
        ease constipation, but prune juice is permitted, as healthy people
        sometimes drink it as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        One who experiences discomfort may do things that healthy people
        normally do, even if his intention is to relieve the discomfort. For
        example, one who has itchy skin may apply oil that healthy people apply
        as well (SA 327:1). One may also apply oil to one’s hands and lips,
        since nowadays people do so even when their skin is not chapped - to
        soften them or for pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one has medicine that helps relieve his minor aches and pains, he
        may mix it into a drink before Shabbat, as long as no one can tell that
        it contains medicine. He may then drink the medicinal liquid on Shabbat
        (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, cited in SSK 34:5).
    </p>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>
        5. Modern Medications
    </h2>
    <p>
        Some maintain that one may take modern, mass-produced medications on
        Shabbat for any type of ache or pain, as there is no real concern that
        anyone will grind anything in order to produce the medicine. However,
        most <em>poskim</em> maintain that even nowadays one who is only mildly
        ill or bothered by an ailment may not take medicine on Shabbat. There
        are two reasons for this. First, according to many, no rabbinic
enactment may be nullified except by a larger and more prominent        <em>beit din</em> than the one that passed the enactment. Second, some
        people still prepare household remedies, so there are cases where the
        reason for the enactment still applies.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, as long as the ailment is merely irritating but not
        painful, it is proper to be stringent and avoid taking mass-produced
        medications. However, if the ailment causes pain, one may take
        medication, because some maintain that the Sages never prohibited
        taking medication when pain is involved. Even though many maintain that
        the Sages’ enactment applies even when pain is involved, in the case of
        mass-produced medication, where there is no concern that a private
        individual would try to prepare it himself, it is proper to be lenient.
        It is worth noting that when the technical law allows leniency, it is
proper to act accordingly so as to fulfill the mitzva of        <em>oneg Shabbat</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if one is bothered by an ailment of the eyes or ears, he
        should not use drops. However, if the ailment causes him pain, he
        should use the drops. The same applies to a runny nose: if it is merely
        irritating, one should not use nose drops, but if it causes pain, he
        should. Similarly, one may take sleeping pills to relieve insomnia,
        since without them he will suffer pain. Perhaps we can suggest that if
        one is pained to the point that he would be willing to walk a kilometer
        in order to get medicine, it indicates that he is truly suffering and
        may thus take mass-produced medications. However, if he thinks it is
        unnecessary to go to that much trouble, it indicates that he has a mere
        ailment, and he should thus refrain from taking medicine.

    </p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>
        6. Medications Taken in Regular Doses
    </h2>
    <p>
        If one began taking a medication during the week, and it must be taken
        for several days consecutively so that skipping the Shabbat dose will
        harm its effectiveness, he may continue taking the medicine on Shabbat.
        This is because some maintain that the rabbinic enactment does not
        apply to dosing that began before Shabbat (R. Shlomo Kluger). When
dealing with mass-produced medicine, one may rely on this opinion even        <em>le-khatĥila</em>, and one may take such medicine even when he is
        not in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, a woman who is taking birth control pills or medication to
        help her maintain a pregnancy may continue taking this medication on
        Shabbat as well.
        <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        If one takes daily vitamin supplements or weight loss pills to improve
        his health, he may continue on Shabbat as well.
    </p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>
        7. Injections, Intravenous Infusion, and Nursing
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, a regular sick person needs an injection or intravenous (IV)
        infusion on Shabbat. Since a subcutaneous injection does not
        necessarily cause bleeding, <em>halakha </em>views it no differently
        from other types of medicine: it is permitted for a sick person. If one
        is not sick but is in pain, he may ask a non-Jew to administer the
        injection.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, a Jew may not administer an intravenous injection or infusion
        on Shabbat, because doing so causes bleeding, which some maintain is
        prohibited by Torah law. Thus, as long as the person is not dangerously
        ill, one should defer to this stringent opinion. If a port was
        installed beneath the skin (with a catheter surgically inserted into a
        vein) before Shabbat, one may attach an IV bag to it on Shabbat, even
        when there is no danger to life (see SSK 33:7). A non-Jew may
        administer an intravenous injection or infusion to a regular sick
        person.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a wound or a needle needs to be disinfected with iodine or peroxide,
        one may not apply the disinfectant using cotton wool or a bandage,
because squeezing liquid out of them is prohibited on account of        <em>Seĥita</em>. Rather, one should pour the iodine or peroxide
        directly onto the surface that needs to be disinfected. Alternatively,
        one may apply it with a tongue depressor or synthetic, non-absorbent
        material.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one knows before Shabbat that he will have to administer an
        injection on Shabbat, it is preferable that he prepare and disinfect
        the syringe and needle before Shabbat. If he forgot to prepare in
        advance, or if it was medically inadvisable to do so, he may prepare
        the shot on Shabbat, as this does not involve a Torah prohibition (see
        SSK 33:8-10).
    </p>
    <p>
        A nursing woman whose breasts are engorged may express or pump her
        excess milk on Shabbat, on condition that she pumps it in such a way
        that the milk goes to waste, such as into the sink or into a container
        with soap in it so that the milk is immediately ruined. It is true that
        expressing milk on Shabbat in order to feed a baby is prohibited by
        Torah law as a <em>tolada</em> of <em>Dash</em> (SA 328:34; above,
        10:17). However, when the milk goes to waste, the prohibition is only
        rabbinic, and to relieve pain the Sages permitted it (SA 330:8). One
        may use a manual pump for this purpose or an electric pump attached to
        a timer that was set before Shabbat. On Shabbat, when the timer
        activates the pump, the nursing woman may use it to pump her milk (SSK
        36:22 n. 63). If the doctors believe that it is necessary for a baby to
        have breast milk, and the mother tries not to miss any opportunity to
        pump during the week, then she may also pump on Shabbat for the baby,
        as this is a case of saving a life (see SSK 36:22 and n. 67).
    </p>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>
        8. Ointments and Compresses
    </h2>
    <p>
        Even when using medicine is permissible, one may not apply topical
        medication (such as creams or ointments) to a bandage or a wound. If
        one applies ointment and smoothes its surface to spread it, he violates
Torah law, as <em>Memare’aĥ</em> is a <em>tolada</em> of        <em>Memaĥek</em> (<em>Shabbat</em> 75b; above, 18:6). It is also
        forbidden to place the ointment onto the body or the bandage without
        spreading it, out of concern that one will end up spreading it. Even if
        the bandage was prepared with ointment before Shabbat, one may not
        place it on the wound on Shabbat, out of concern that he will end up
        spreading it (SA 328:25).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, to alleviate or prevent pain, the Sages allow one to place
        ointment directly on a wound or bandage, though one who does so must be
        careful to avoid spreading it. If the ointment was in a tube, he should
        place the tube directly on the wound. If it is in a container, one may
        apply the ointment using a tongue depressor or a spoon. The primary
        concern is that it should not be spread. When the bandage is placed on
        the wound, the cream will spread out along the sides. Nevertheless, as
        long as one does not smooth the surface intentionally, this is not
        prohibited (SSK 33:14; above, section 5).
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if one is in pain, he may place medicated cream on his skin
        and rub it in until it is completely absorbed. This is because as long
as one wants all the cream to be absorbed, it is not considered        <em>Memare’aĥ</em>. However, if one wants part of the cream to remain
        on the surface of the skin to make it smooth, applying the cream is
        prohibited by Torah law (<em>Da’at Torah</em> 328:26; R. Shlomo Zalman
Auerbach cited in SSK ch. 33 n. 64; based on MA 316:24 and MB        <em>ad loc.</em> 49; see above, 14:5, and <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one is suffering from great pain that is weakening his entire body,
        he is considered a sick person, and one may treat him with compresses.
        Cloths that were dampened before Shabbat may be used for this purpose.
        If necessary, one may wet a completely clean cloth on Shabbat to use as
        a compress (see above, 14:4 and n. 2). In any case, he must take great
        care not to wring out the compress, whether in order for the water to
reach the sore spot or in order to clean it after use (SSK 33:19; see        <em>Harĥavot</em> here and above, 12:8, 10).

        9. Adhesive Bandages, Cloth Bandages, and Treating Wounds
    </h2>
    <p>
        One may use an adhesive bandage ("Band-Aid") to protect a wound or a
        sensitive area from the friction caused by clothing or other objects.
        Even one who is bothered by a mild ailment may do so, since an adhesive
        bandage does not cure but merely protects (SA 328:23).
    </p>
    <p>
        Although one may not affix an adhesive bandage to paper or the like
        because of the prohibition of <em>Tofer</em>, affixing one to the body
        is not prohibited, because <em>Tofer</em> does not apply to the human
        body. Besides, adhesive bandages are meant to remain on the body for
        only a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
        , one should try not to attach the ends of the adhesive bandage to each
        other and to avoid using an adhesive bandage to keep a cloth bandage in
        place. This is because some maintain that these cases are rabbinically
prohibited, as sticking one item to another in such a manner resembles        <em>Tofer</em>. If necessary one may be lenient and rely on those who
        maintain that since adhesive bandages are affixed temporarily, for a
        short period of time, one may do so just as one may tie a temporary
        knot that lasts only a short time.
        <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not cut a bandage or adhesive bandage to size, and one who does
        so violates the Torah prohibition of <em>Meĥatekh</em> (MB 322:18;
        above 15:10). If a bandage is too long, one should wrap it around the
        injury multiple times rather than cutting it. If one knows that he may
        need to bandage wounds on Shabbat, he should prepare bandages of
        various sizes before Shabbat. It is also good to prepare methods of
        fastening them with safety pins or an elastic sleeve, since it is
        preferable <em>le-khatĥila</em> not to use an adhesive bandage in order
        to keep a cloth bandage in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may use a butterfly bandage to hold together the edges of a cut.
        This is because of two lenient opinions. First, some maintain that
        there is no prohibition of <em>Tofer</em> when it comes to the body.
        Second, some say that this type of bandage cannot qualify as sewing,
        since all it does is hold closed the edges of the cut, helping the
        wound close up on its own (SSK 35:25; see <em>Harĥavot</em> 27:2:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to stop bleeding, one may use a bandage (using a permissible
        method of tying) or antihemorrhagic sprays or powders (like Dermatol).
        These measures are not considered medicinal; they simply stop the
        bleeding (see SA 328:29). Additionally, one may place iodine on a wound
        in order to prevent infection (SSK 35:13).
        <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One may clean blood with a bandage or paper towel, even though this
        will color them red. Similarly, one may bandage a wound that has been
        treated with iodine, even though the color of the iodine will stain the
        bandage or paper towel. This is because this "coloring" is in fact a
        manner of soiling the material. Additionally, none of these items
(bandage, paper towel, body) are meant to be dyed (SAH<em> </em>§302,        <em>Kuntres Aĥaron</em>; MB 303:79 and 320:58; above 18:5).
    </p>
    <p>
If an adhesive bandage is irritating, one may remove it. When doing so,        <em>le-khatĥila</em> one should try to avoid ripping out hairs, because
        of the <em>melakha</em> of <em>Gozez</em>. If there is no alternative,
        one may remove the adhesive bandage even if it is clear that this will
        rip out hairs, since one does not want this to happen and it is simply
        an ancillary effect of his action (SSK 35:30).
    </p>
    <a name="10"></a><h2>
        10. Opening Medicine Packages
    </h2>
    <p>
        When it is permissible to take medicine but it is packaged in plastic,
        paper, or cardboard, one may tear open the packaging in order to get to
        the medicine. Those who are stringent make sure to destroy the
        packaging, rendering it unusable for storing the medicine (above,
15:12). It is preferable to avoid tearing words on the packaging.        <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if it cannot be opened without tearing words, it
        may still be opened, because one’s intention is not to erase the
        letters, and the "erasing" happens through a destructive action (as
        explained above, 18:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        When one may take pills that are inside a sealed plastic container, he
        may remove the cover, even though doing so breaks the temporary plastic
        seal connecting the cover to the container. This is not considered
        making a <em>kli</em>, because the container and cover were already
        finished products; they were simply attached to the plastic seal (above
        15:13-14).
    </p>
    <a name="11"></a><h2>
        11. Measuring for Medical Purposes and Using a Thermometer
    </h2>
    <p>
        When medically necessary, one may use a regular mercury thermometer to
        take someone’s temperature. One may also use a manual blood pressure
        monitor. Although without a significant need one may not measure things
        on Shabbat, as this is a weekday activity, it is nevertheless permitted
        for a mitzva or medical need (SA 306:7 and 328:43; above 22:6). It is
        also permitted to shake down a thermometer so that the mercury
        contracts (SSK 40:2).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some rule leniently and permit a sick person to use a thermometer
        strip, which displays body temperature upon being placed on one’s
        forehead’s. They maintain that this is not considered <em>Kotev </em>
        since the numbers are already imprinted on the strip, and the
        temperature merely makes them visible for a short time, after which
        they disappear (<em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:29). Others maintain that
        using this type of thermometer is rabbinically prohibited, considering
        it temporary writing (SSK 40:2). Since it is a rabbinic law, one may be
lenient in a case of necessity (<em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:30; see        <em>Harĥavot</em> 18:4:4).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether one may perform a medical
        test on Shabbat that causes color to appear. Some prohibit this on
        account of <em>Tzove’a</em>. Others permit it, as one is not interested
        in the color, only in the test result. <em>Le-khatĥila</em> one should
        be stringent, but when necessary he may be lenient, since this is a
case of uncertainty regarding rabbinic law (see SSK 33:20, and        <em>Harĥavot</em>).
    </p>
    <a name="12"></a><h2>
        12. Permitted Actions
    </h2>
    <p>
        On Shabbat, one may perform therapeutic treatments that are not
        normally done with the aid of medications. Since there is no concern
        that one will come to grind ingredients, such treatment is not included
        in the prohibition of medicine on Shabbat. However, if there is no real
        need, even such treatment is prohibited because it is a weekday
        activity. But as long as a real need exists, for example when one is in
        pain, it is permissible (SA 328:43; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 136).
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, one may apply pressure to an injury with a utensil or his
        hand to prevent swelling, as this is a type of therapeutic action that
        is not normally done with medications (<em>Ĥayei Adam</em> 69:5; MB
        328:144; SHT <em>ad loc.</em> 104). Similarly, one may apply ice to an
        injury in order to prevent swelling and reduce the pain, because this
        is not normally done with medicine (SSK 35:35 and n. 92).
    </p>
    <p>
        If one’s eyes hurt, he may do eye exercises on Shabbat, because there
        is no medication that substitutes for these exercises. If one’s eyes do
        not hurt, but he wants to strengthen his eye muscles, the exercises
        have the same status as physical therapy exercises: if one needs to do
        them several times daily, one may do them on Shabbat as well (as
        explained in the next section).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may place an orthodontic retainer in one’s mouth on Shabbat, as no
        medication can straighten one’s teeth (SSK 34:29).
        <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One who has a stomach ache or an earache may place a hot water bottle
        on the affected area to relieve his pain (MB 326:19). Ice may also be
        used to relieve pain (SSK 33:15).
        <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
    </p>
    <p>
        One who has an earache may put cotton in his ears. This is not
        considered medicinal, since it does not heal the ear, but simply
        protects it from the wind (SA 303:15; SSK 34:9). One who wishes to
        soothe his throat may swallow a raw egg, as this is not considered a
        medicinal act (SA 328:38). One may put talcum powder into one’s shoes
        to absorb sweat and foot odor or to soothe his feet. However, one who
        has athlete’s foot may not put medicated powder in his shoes. If he is
        in pain, though, he may (section 5 above).
    </p>
    <a name="13"></a><h2>
        13. Physical Therapy, Massage, and Acupuncture
    </h2>
    <p>
        Physical therapy exercises are often meant to restore function to limbs
        or muscles that have atrophied as a result of injury or paralysis. If
        it is not strictly necessary to do the exercises on Shabbat, one should
        not do them then, because this is a weekday activity<em>.</em> For
        example, if one is not always careful to do the exercises regularly
        during the week, one may not do them on Shabbat. Even if no equipment
        is used, since these exercises are undertaken with professional
        guidance, they are considered a weekday activity. One should instead
        exercise on Friday before Shabbat begins, and on Saturday night after
        Shabbat ends. However, if the exercises are indeed necessary for the
        patient, and during the week he takes care to do them several times a
        day, he may do them on Shabbat as well. One may even use equipment, as
        long as it does not require electricity to operate. These exercises
        have the same status as pills that must be taken for several
consecutive days: one may take them on Shabbat as well (n. 4 above;        <em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 328:93 in the name of R. Shlomo Zalman
        Auerbach).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may do gentle stretches to loosen his back or neck or to refresh
        himself. This is not considered medicinal, nor is it considered a
        weekday activity. However, one may not do calisthenics, which maintain
        or improve one’s fitness, as they are a weekday activity (see above,
        22:8).
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not give a professional massage to someone who is experiencing
        discomfort in his back or another limb. Since such aches are treated
        with pills and ointments, their treatment is included in the rabbinic
        enactment against medicine on Shabbat. In addition, a professional
        massage is considered a weekday activity. Nevertheless, if the ailment
        is truly painful, one may give a professional massage in order to
        relieve it. As we have already seen (section 5), since medications
        today are generally mass-produced, one who is in pain may use such
        medications. Certainly, then, one may provide treatments that do not
        involve medication at all. Furthermore, the prohibition on weekday
        activities does not apply when pain is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may always give a non-professional massage. Since it is not
        professional, it is not considered medicinal, nor is it considered a
        weekday activity. Even a professional masseur may give his family
        members a non-professional massage that is meant to be soothing. Since
        they are not in pain and the massage is not done in a therapeutic
        context, it is not prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acupressure is a treatment in which one applies pressure to various
        parts of the head or body in order to relieve pain and restore the
        health and vitality of the body and its limbs. When there is no great
        need, one may not perform it on Shabbat, both because of the enactment
        against medicine and because it is a weekday activity. However, one who
        is in pain may undergo acupressure, either manually or with an
        instrument designed for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may not administer acupuncture on Shabbat even for one who is in
pain, because the needles are <em>muktzeh</em>        <em> meĥamat ĥesron kis</em>. However, a patient who needs acupuncture
        very badly may be treated. As we already have seen (n. 2 above), the
        Sages suspended their enactments for the sake of caring for a sick
        person. Even for a sick person, acupuncture is only permitted on
        condition that the treatment will not necessarily cause bleeding, which
        is prohibited by Torah law.
    </p>
    <p>
        In circumstances where a professional may provide treatment (of pain or
        illness) on Shabbat, he may not accept payment for his services.
        However, if he provides treatment during the week as well, the Shabbat
        payment may be subsumed within the weekday payments (above, 22:12).
        When a professional is summoned to provide treatment on Shabbat, one
        may not discuss the arrangements for subsuming his fee. Rather, one may
        say that after Shabbat they will discuss the details that they may not
        discuss on Shabbat. This is because when necessary, the Sages permitted
        alluding to such matters (above, 22:3, 10).
    </p>
    <a name="14"></a><h2>
        14. Seeing a Non-Observant Doctor
    </h2>
    <p>
        If a sick person whose life is not threatened needs to see a doctor on
        Shabbat for an examination or treatment, he should try to visit a
        religious doctor who knows how to avoid <em>melakhot</em> that are
        prohibited by Torah law. If he goes to a Jewish doctor who normally
        desecrates Shabbat, there is a concern that he will cause the doctor to
        desecrate Shabbat. For example, the doctor might turn on a light in
        order to examine him, write down his personal information, or write a
        prescription for him. We have already seen that only rabbinic
        prohibitions are suspended for the sake of caring for a sick person who
        is not dangerously ill, but Torah prohibitions remain in force.
        Furthermore, just as one should give preference to an observant doctor,
        one should also give preference to a hospital that operates in
        accordance with <em>halakha</em>. In hospitals that do not operate in
        accordance with <em>halakha</em>, he may encounter Jewish staff members
        who will transgress Torah prohibitions on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is not possible to see an observant doctor or visit a hospital
        that operates in accordance with <em>halakha</em>, one may see a
        non-observant doctor as long as he requests that the doctor refrain
        from desecrating Shabbat by Torah law on his account. If the doctor
insists on writing in the normal fashion or on doing other        <em>melakhot</em> that are prohibited by Torah law, the patient should
        forgo the treatment to avoid aiding Shabbat desecration. Under pressing
        circumstances, when the exam and treatment are extremely urgent, the
        patient may rely on the lenient position and accept treatment from this
        doctor.

            According to most Rishonim, one may not violate a Torah prohibition
            for a person who is in danger of losing a limb (Rosh, Ran, Rashba,
            and seemingly Rambam). Others maintain that one may indeed
desecrate Shabbat to save a limb (<em>Tosafot</em>, Rabbeinu Tam,<em>Sefer Ha</em>-<em>aguda</em>, and Me’iri). In practice, SA            <em> </em>rules that one may not violate a Torah prohibition in
            such a case (328:17). However, according to current medical
            opinion, in practice, when a person’s limb is in danger, it is
            almost always life-threatening, as there is always the possibility
            of infection setting in (<em>Nishmat Avraham</em> 328:49). This may
            be the rationale of the Rishonim who are lenient in a case of
            danger to a limb. <em>Melamed Le-ho’il</em> 2:32 presents similar
            reasoning, as detailed in <em>Harĥavot</em>.

            According to Ran, the Sages’ dispensation for a sick person was
limited to requesting things of a non-Jew, as stated in            <em>Shabbat</em> 129a. In contrast, according to Rashba (and Rambam
            as well, according to <em>Magid Mishneh</em> and <em>Tur</em>) one
            may transgress all rabbinic prohibitions for a sick person. This is
borne out by the law recorded in the Gemara that a sick person            <em> </em>may nurse from an animal on Shabbat; while this is a
            prohibited form of milking the animal, the <em>shinui</em> renders
            the prohibition rabbinic (<em>Ketubot</em> 60a). Ramban agrees that
            all rabbinic prohibitions are suspended if there is danger to a
            limb. But, he continues, if there is no danger to a limb, one may
            only ask a non-Jew to help; a Jew may not transgress even rabbinic
prohibitions in such a case. That is permitted only if a<em>shinui</em> is used, in which case the action is reduced to a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. SA<em> </em>328:17 states that Ramban’s
position seems correct. The Vilna Gaon follows it as well, as do MB            <em>ad loc. </em>57 and SHT 396:9. In contrast, <em>Ĥayei Adam</em>
            69:12 states that when it is impossible to use a <em>shinui</em> to
            do what is necessary, one may do it without a <em>shinui</em> (even
though he thus transgresses a <em>shvut </em>rather than a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>). MB<em> </em>328:102 concurs. Going even
further, some Aĥaronim maintain that a Jew may even perform a<em>melakha</em> that is prohibited by Torah law with a            <em>shinui</em> if no non-Jew is available. This is based on Rashba
            and his followers. (Some maintain that Ramban would agree as well,
            and that this can be inferred from his book <em>Torat Ha-adam</em>
.) This is the approach of SAH<em> </em>328:19; <em>Eglei Tal</em>,            <em>Toĥen</em> 18; and <em>Tehila Le-David</em> 328:22. Since this
            is a rabbinic disagreement, the law follows the lenient opinion.
            Recent <em>poskim</em> who agree include: R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach, as cited in SSK 33:18; <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:36, n. 4;
            and R. Ovadia Yosef, as cited in <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 328:11. See
            too <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> ch. 20 nn. 148-149.
        </p>
        <p>
            All agree that one may not turn off a light so a sick person can
sleep (<em>Shabbat</em> 30a). At first glance, since this is a            <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em>, which according to
            many <em>poskim</em> is only rabbinically prohibited (above, 9:6),
Rashba and those who follow him should permit it for a sick person            <em> </em>even without a <em>shinui</em>. Nevertheless, since
            turning off the light is more severe than other rabbinic
prohibitions, the Sages forbade doing it even for a sick person<em> </em>(MB 278:3). Turning off a light to allow a sick person<em> </em>to sleep is permitted if one does so with a            <em>shinui</em>, for example by using his arm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eating rabbinically prohibited food is more severe than
            transgressing a <em>shvut</em>, and a regular sick person thus may
            not do this (Rema, YD 155:3). However, he may eat food that was
cooked by a non-Jew (SA 328:19), and he should make the regular            <em>berakhot</em> over the food (MB <em>ad loc.</em> 63). One may
            move a <em>muktzeh</em> item for a sick person<em> </em>without
using a <em>shinui</em>. Some are stringent and maintain that            <em>le-khatĥila</em> one should still use a <em>shinui</em> (MB
            328:58). Some argue that the enactment against taking medicine (out
            of concern that people will end up grinding ingredients) applies to
            a regular sick person. (See BHL 328:37, s.v. "ve-khen.") However,
            in practice, we rule that the enactment applies only to a mildly
            sick person or to one experiencing discomfort,<em> </em>as
            described in the next section (<em>Beit Yosef</em> and Rema
            328:37).

            <em>Ketzot Ha-shulĥan</em>
            (§134, <em>Badei Ha-shulĥan</em> 7) states the argument for
            leniency based on the fact that nowadays people do not prepare
            medicine by themselves. However, for the two reasons I presented
            above, it is inclined to be stringent. <em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>
            8:15:15 states that it depends on the rationale for the enactment
            against medicine. If the concern is specific - that in order to
            prepare the medicine, people will end up grinding the ingredients -
            then there is room for leniency. In contrast, if the concern is
            more general - that as part of dealing with medical issues, people
            will end up violating various transgressions - then the prohibition
            stands even nowadays. <em>Tzitz Eliezer </em>concludes by inclining
            toward leniency. <em>She’arim Metzuyanim Ba-halakha</em> 91:2 also
            inclines toward leniency. Many oppose them and prohibit taking
mass-produced medicine on Shabbat, including SSK 34:3;<em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 3:53; R. Ovadia Yosef,<em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4, Tetzaveh §19; and            <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:36:9. Nevertheless, when great pain is
            involved, R. Ovadia is lenient, even if the sick person<em> </em>is
            not bedridden. SSK 34:3 rules stringently, stating in n. 7 in the
            name of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach that the entire enactment is
            relevant only when there is pain, because that is when one would
            end up grinding medication. Nevertheless, SSK 33:16 permits taking
            sleeping pills in order to relieve great pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some are lenient concerning all medicine, even for regular pain.
            This is the opinion of R. Mordechai Benet, who argues that
            sometimes the Sages were permissive when one is in pain, even in a
            case resembling a <em>melakha she-eina tzerikha le-gufah</em> (SA
            328:28; above, 14:2); certainly, then, they would permit taking
medicine in a case of pain. <em>Minĥat Shabbat</em> 91:1 and            <em>She’arim Metzuyanim Ba-halakha</em> 91:3 take this position as
            well. Radbaz 3:540, appearing earlier than any of them, states that
the prohibition on taking medicine is even less severe than a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>. Therefore, when any pain is involved, one
            may be lenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus there are two disagreements here: 1) Does the enactment apply
            to mass-produced medicine? 2) Does it apply to people who are in
pain? It is true that in each of these disagreements, most            <em>poskim</em> feel that one should be stringent. Nevertheless,
            since these disagreements concern a rabbinic prohibition, one who
            is lenient has an opinion to rely upon. Furthermore, in a situation
            where there are two reasons to be lenient, such as if the medicine
            is mass-produced and the person is in pain, then it is a twofold
            doubt<em> </em>that affects <em>oneg Shabbat</em>. Accordingly, one
            may be lenient even <em>le-khatĥila</em>. (We should add that when
            the medication simply relieves pain but does not cure the illness,
            some <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is not considered medication
            for purposes of the rabbinic enactment. See <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>
            8:15:15:21 as well as 14:50, and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 328:52.)

            Some permit anyone who has started taking a medication before
            Shabbat to continue taking it on Shabbat, as they maintain that the
            Sages’ enactment was not meant for such a case. Since he has
            already started taking the medicine on Friday, he has enough time
            to prepare whatever amount he needs for Shabbat, and there is no
concern that he will need to grind anything (R. Shlomo Kluger,            <em>Sefer Ha-ĥayim</em> 328:25). Some are lenient only when a
            medication must be taken every day for at least a week, and
            skipping a day could be harmful (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach). See
            SSK ch. 34 n. 77 and <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 20:124. Even if the
            medication is not mass-produced, there is room for leniency, since
            the disagreement concerns a rabbinic law; certainly, then, one may
            be lenient when the medication is mass-produced.

        <p>
            SA<em> </em>328:37 rules that a healthy person may eat food that
            sick people eat to help them get better. According to this, a
            healthy person may take vitamins and diet pills on Shabbat.
            However, according to MA<em> </em>and MB<em> ad loc</em>. 120, a
healthy person may not do this in order to improve his health.            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 3:54 takes this stringent opinion into
            account for a weak person, but permits a healthy person to take
            vitamins prophylactically. This is also the opinion of R. Ovadia
            Yosef, <em>Halikhot Olam</em> vol. 4, Tetzaveh §41. Nevertheless,
if a sick person wishes to be lenient, he may rely on            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> (cited in the previous note), which rules
            leniently because people do not grind medicine themselves anymore.
            Certainly, then, one may be lenient if he takes the vitamins daily,
            as we explained above.

            We saw above in ch. 13 n. 9 that according to Rabbeinu Yoel,
            Ra’avya, Rashbam, and others, the laws of <em>Tofer</em> are
            similar to the laws of <em>Kosheir</em>, and thus there is no
            prohibition of sewing something that will last for less than a
            week. Rabbeinu Peretz and <em>Mordechai</em> disagree, arguing that
            the two <em>melakhot</em> are not analogous, and the rabbinic
            prohibition of <em>Tofer</em> applies even to temporary
            attachments. In times of need, one may rely on the lenient
authorities; see there. This is also the opinion of            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> (8:15 and in the summary, 14:14-15). R.
            Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited in SSK ch. 35 n. 67) adds that even
            when the cloth bandage is later thrown away together with the
            adhesive bandage so that they stay attached for an extended period
            of time, this is not considered a permanent attachment, since it
            serves no purpose. We also saw above in ch. 13 n. 9 that it is not
            prohibited to remove the plastic strips protecting the adhesive on
            the tapes of a disposable diaper. The same applies to removing the
            plastic strips protecting the adhesive of an adhesive bandage.

            ch. 20 n. 250 expresses surprise at SSK’s<em> </em>permission to
            use Dermatol, maintaining that it is indeed medicinal. R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach seems to maintain that Dermatol and iodine are not
            meant to heal, but simply to stop bleeding and prevent infection.
            In any case, even if they do heal, someone who is suffering would
            be permitted to use them, as I pointed out here in section 5 and n.
            3.

            SA<em> </em>328:43 states that someone in pain may perform actions
            to alleviate an illness that is not normally treated with
            medication. Such treatments were not included in the Sages’
            enactment, since there is no concern in these cases that one will
            end up grinding ingredients for medicine. MB<em> ad loc</em>. 136
            clarifies that when there is no pain, one may not administer such
            treatments because it is a weekday activity. Along the same lines,
            SA<em> </em>306:7 permits measuring for the sake of a mitzva or for
            a medical need, even though measuring is normally considered a
            weekday activity. MB <em>ad loc</em>. 36 explains that healing the
            body is itself a mitzva. At first glance it would seem that placing
            a retainer in one’s mouth should be prohibited because it is a
            weekday activity, as it does not alleviate pain. However, R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach (cited in SSK ch. 34 n. 113) explains that it seems
            reasonable that the prohibition on weekday activities does not
            apply when results are seen only after a long period of time. This
            is also cited in <em>Orĥot Shabbat</em> 20:154. I maintain that
            administering treatments is considered a prohibited weekday
            activity only when not necessary. Since they can wait, undertaking
            them on Shabbat is considered a weekday activity. However, when
            there is a real need, then even if there is no pain involved, it is
            not considered a weekday activity. This can be inferred from the
            position of Radbaz and those who follow him (above, n. 3), namely,
that the enactment banning medicines is less severe than a            <em>shvut di-shvut</em>, which is itself permitted when pain is
            involved (above, 9:11). When it comes to treating sick people, the
            prohibition on weekday activities is even less severe than the ban
            on medication (as explained in MB 328:136).

            <em>Shabbat</em>
            40b states that one may not place a container of hot water on a
            person’s stomach, due to the risk of spilling. Rashi and Ran
            explain that this is the reason for the prohibition on Shabbat as
            well, but <em>Tosafot </em>state that it is forbidden on Shabbat
            because of the ban on medicine on Shabbat. It would seem that
            according to Rashi and Ran, if the hot water bottle is sealed well,
            one may use it on Shabbat, whereas according to <em>Tosafot</em> it
            is still prohibited. MB 326:19 states that one may be lenient if
            there is a great need. Based on what we said in section 5,
            nowadays, when medicine is mass-produced, one may be lenient
            concerning all medicine for one in pain.

            R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited in SSK ch. 40 n. 32) says that
            when one is entitled to treatment covered by his health fund or
            HMO, he is entitled to go to the hospital and is not responsible to
            prevent the doctor from violating Torah prohibitions. Just as a
            creditor has a right to bring his debtor to court even if the
            debtor threatens to curse him, blaspheme God, and swear falsely,
            the creditor may still takeakeucedalized painstch this to Bactine
            or a him to court. Similarly, one may accept the medical treatment
            to which he is entitled. SSK 40:10 rules this way in practice. This
            ruling can be combined with that of <em>Shakh</em>, which maintains
            that one does not have to worry about aiding the Shabbat
            desecration of a non-observant Jew who desecrates Shabbat
regularly. However, according to <em>Ĥavot Yair</em> and most            <em>poskim</em>, the prohibition of aiding Shabbat desecration
            applies even to him (<em>Pitĥei Teshuva</em>, YD 151:3).
        </p>
        <p>
            In any case, many are stringent here because in practice, one who
            sees a non-observant doctor on Shabbat indeed causes him to sin.
            The Torah commands us to reprove our fellow Jew in order to help
            them avoid sin. Yet here the patient is aiding the Shabbat
desecration of the doctor. Those who are stringent include<em>Zivĥei Tzedek</em>, OĤ 2:19; Ben Ish Ĥai in<em>Rav Berakhot</em>, <em>ma’arekhet lamed</em>, 3; and            <em>Yesodei Yeshurun</em>. See <em>Harĥavot</em>.
