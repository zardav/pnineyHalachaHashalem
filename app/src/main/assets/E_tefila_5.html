    Chapter Five: Preparations for Prayer
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    1. Emotional Preparation
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Prayer is intended to elevate and strengthen people. Therefore, knowing that one is about to be uplifted and brought closer to Hashem, a person must
    approach prayer out of joy and not while in a state of sadness or apathy.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Berachot</em> 31a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 93:2), "One should not pray out of laughter," because laughter nullifies one's
    awe for God, and a person must pray out of fear and submission. "Nor amidst talk," because chatter distracts a person from his inner world and prayer is
    supposed to emerge from the depths of one's soul. "Nor from lightheadedness and idle words," because prayer is based on the recognition of one's ability to
    do wonders with his speech, and if a person comes to prayer with idle words, he demonstrates that he does not value his speech (see <em>Olat Ra'ayah</em>,
    part 1, p. 29).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is good to give <em>tzedakah</em> before praying (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>92:10), for by doing so one approaches prayer pleased and uplifted from the
    mitzvah he just performed. Furthermore, when we come to pray and request kindness and compassion from Hashem, it is proper that first we ourselves show
    mercy on the poor. The <em>Ari HaKadosh </em>says that before prayer it is good to reflect upon the mitzvah, "<em>V'ahavta l're'acha kamocha</em>" ("Love
    your fellow Jew like yourself,") for this is a great Torah principle. The prayers are written in the plural because we are praying for the nation as a
    whole.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should not begin to pray when his mind is preoccupied. Even someone who has the privilege to learn Torah before praying should try not to come to
    prayer immediately after learning a very complex subject of study. His mind is liable to be absorbed in thoughts of the topic that he has been studying,
    and he will not be able to concentrate properly on his prayer. Instead, before praying, he should learn straightforward matters of halachah, or uplifting
    essays on <em>emunah</em> (faith). <em>B'dieved</em>, one should not avoid praying in a <em>minyan</em>, even if he is preoccupied with matters of Torah or
    has other concerns (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 93:3; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 6).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of uplifting verses prior to praying the <em>Amidah</em>,<em> </em>so that before the <em>Amidah</em> people
would be engrossed in inspiring and elating matters. Before <em>Shacharit</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em>, we recite the <em>berachah</em>,<em> </em>"    <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em>," and before <em>Minchah</em> we say <em>Ashrei</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 93:2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Talmud records that devout people paused to meditate a full hour before praying so that they could properly direct their hearts to their Father in
    Heaven (<em>B</em>e<em>rachot</em> 30b; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 93:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 1).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    2. Washing One's Hands
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person who prays must be in a state of purity. It is therefore a mitzvah to wash one's hands before engaging in prayer. However, a distinction is made
    between a situation in which a person knows that his hands are unclean, and one in which he does not know if his hands have been dirtied.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    For example, if one knows that his hands are dirty because he relieved himself, or touched normally covered parts of his body which have become soiled from
perspiration, he must wash his hands before praying. According to many <em>poskim</em>, he must recite a <em>berachah</em> on this washing even before    <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> (<em>Rambam</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, <em>Gra</em>). However, the accepted custom is to recite a <em>berachah</em> solely
    on the washing before <em>Shacharit</em>, because when a person awakens in the morning, it is as if he is created anew. Regarding washing one's hands
    before <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em>, even one whose hands are dirty does not recite a <em>berachah</em> (according to the <em>Rashba</em>, see
    further in this book 8:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In any case, according to all opinions, a person who dirtied his hands is obligated to wash them before he prays. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, he should pour
water over his entire hand with a vessel. However, if he does not have a vessel, it is sufficient that he rinse his hands with water from a faucet.    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to wash his hands before praying, if there is no water close to him, he must trouble himself and walk up to the distance of a <em>mil</em>, which
    is approximately a kilometer (960 meters or approx. .597 miles). However, if, as he is walking, the designated time for prayer will pass, or he will miss
    the opportunity to pray with a <em>minyan</em>, he can rub his hands with sand or on his clothing, in order to remove any trace of dirt from them - and
    then he may pray (<em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 92:4; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:20).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Regarding someone who does not know if his hands are dirty, since he doesn't remember if he touched the parts of his body which are normally covered, the    <em>poskim</em> are divided as to whether or not he must wash his hands before prayer. Hence, if there is water available, he should wash his hands.
    However, if there is no water near him, he does not need to wash his hands and he may rely on the <em>poskim</em> who maintain that it is only necessary to
wash one's hands before prayer if they are unclean. To be certain, one should rub his hands on his clothing (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 92:5, 233:2;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:26; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>V'im</em>").
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Concerning one who relieves himself, washes his hands in his house, and afterwards is careful not to touch the parts of his body which are normally
    covered, and then goes to synagogue, he need not wash his hands again before praying. Similarly, if someone who arrives at synagogue to learn and pray
    washes his hands before learning, and is careful not to touch the parts of his body that are normally covered, it is not necessary to wash his hands again
    before praying.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    3. <em>Kippah</em> and Belt
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person must prepare himself for prayer, feel awe towards God's majesty and glory, and be happy that he is about to stand before the King of Kings in
    prayer. This should also be apparent in his dress; one's clothes should be respectable, fitting for one who stands before the King.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Men are obligated to cover their heads while praying, while reciting the name of Heaven, and before entering a synagogue (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 91:3).
    However, in practice, based on the custom accepted in Judaism, men are careful to wear a <em>kippah</em> (yarmulke) all day long (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    2:6). In any case, the obligation to wear a <em>kippah</em> while praying, when reciting God's name, and while in a synagogue is greater, for it is rooted
    in law and not just in custom.<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Additionally, although there are those who say that single women must also cover their heads while praying and reciting <em>berachot</em>, it is customary
    for women not to be strict about this.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should wear a belt while praying, for the belt creates a division between one's upper body, including the head and heart, and one's <em>ervah</em>
    (nakedness). In that regard, prayer is superior to other matters of sanctity, for concerning other matters of sanctity it is unnecessary to wear a belt
    specifically, rather any separation between one's heart and one's nakedness is acceptable. Therefore anyone wearing underwear has a divider between his
    heart and his <em>ervah</em>. However, out of respect for the prayer service, it is a mitzvah to wear a belt, for that is the respectful way to pray, as it
    is written (Amos 4:12), "Israel, prepare to meet your God." Nevertheless, someone who normally walks around the whole day without a belt need not put one
    on before praying.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is an extra pious act to always put on a belt for prayer because a belt signifies the separation between the lofty side of a person, comprised of the
    brain and the heart, and the lowly part of a person, containing his <em>ervah</em> and legs. Most people are deeply involved in their bodily desires, their
    brains and hearts occupied solely with matters of the moment and materialism. However, the Jewish people, who received the Torah from Heaven, are capable
    of overcoming their baser inclinations. They can direct their minds and hearts to superior matters, subsequently returning to the world of materialism and
    action in order to repair it. That is what the belt worn during prayer represents. The <em>Chachamim</em> even instituted a special <em>berachah</em>
    concerning this in the morning blessings - "<em>Ozer Yisrael bigevurah</em>" ("Who girds Israel with strength"). This explains why <em>Chassidim</em>
    enhance the mitzvah by wearing a special belt for prayer (a <em>gartle</em>).<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    4. The Appropriate Dress for Prayer
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person who finds himself in a situation in which he has no clothes is obligated to wear at least shorts and an undershirt for prayer (<em>Berachot</em>
25a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 91:1). Although while reciting <em>Shema</em> and <em>berachot</em> it is sufficient, <em>b'dieved</em>, to only cover one's    <em>ervah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 74:6), while praying the <em>Amidah</em> before the King, one must at least cover his <em>ervah</em> and his heart
    (meaning, his front and back).<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button><strong></strong>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    All this is <em>b'dieved</em>, but<em> l'chatchilah</em> one should enhance the mitzvah by wearing respectable clothing for prayer, so that one show at
    least as much honor to God as he does to human beings. Just as a person is careful to wear dignified clothing when meeting important people, so too, he
    must dress at least as respectably before praying. Indeed, a person who goes out once in his life to greet a king makes sure to wear his nicest clothing.
    However, a person who sees the king every day does not wear his fanciest garments; but he does make sure to wear clothes that suit his profession and
status. Similarly, we come before the King three times a day, and we therefore dress nicely for prayer, but we save our finest apparel for    <em>Shabbatot</em>,<em> </em>festivals, and joyous celebrations.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Everything depends on the custom of the place and the person. There are communities where everyone is accustomed to wearing a suit and hat to significant
    events, and thus they are required to dress that way for prayer as well. Likewise, in a place where it is not accepted to appear before important people in
    sandals without socks, certainly one must wear socks with his sandals while praying as well. Yet in places where people usually walk around in sandals
without socks, and do not wear ties and hats even when approaching important people, they need not adopt different garb for prayer (based on    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 91:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, praying in a <em>minyan</em> is more important than wearing respectable clothes. Therefore, if someone who usually prays in a suit and hat finds
    himself in a situation in which going to his house to bring his suit and hat will cause him to miss praying in a <em>minyan</em>, it is better that he pray
in simple attire in a <em>minyan</em>, for the mitzvah to pray in a <em>minyan</em> takes precedence over enhancing the mitzvah by wearing nice clothing (    <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 1:7).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If one is wearing disgraceful clothes, normally not worn on the street, such as dirty work clothes or shorts which he put on to work in his yard, it is
    better that he change his clothes, even if he will miss praying with a <em>minyan</em>. If he wears such clothing to pray, he will offend the respect of
    Heaven. Additionally, there is concern that he will not be able to concentrate on his prayer, since he will be thinking that everyone is staring at his
    disgraceful dress.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    5. Detailed Laws of One's Dress for Prayer
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Those whose profession requires them to wear work clothes and it is difficult for them to change before praying are permitted to pray in their work
    clothes, because for them, these articles of clothing are not considered disgraceful. Nevertheless, in situations in which they have time to change their
    clothes, they should try to come to prayer in more respectable attire.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One should not pray in pajamas (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 91:11). However, a person who is ill is permitted to pray in pajamas, because it is accepted that
    one who is not feeling well wears pajamas, even when important people come to visit him.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
One should not stand in prayer wearing a raincoat, boots and gloves, because that is not the way to stand in front of important people (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 91:12). Yet, when it is very cold, it is permissible to pray in a raincoat and gloves, because this does not offend the respect
    due to prayer. Additionally, in a place where everyone regularly wears boots, one may wear them while praying.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Young boys and members of <em>kibbutzim</em>, who regularly walk around in shorts, even when important people come to visit them, are permitted to pray in
    that manner. However, the <em>chazan</em> must cover his legs until below the knee, because a person who wears shorts is called a <em>poche'ach </em>and is
    not allowed to lead the prayer service (see chapter 4:4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sometimes, a person is in a place where people normally dress less formally, such as a vacation spot; there, even those who always wear suits may wear just
    shirts without a jacket. In such a situation, whoever is not embarrassed to walk around without a suit, even before distinguished people, may also pray
    that way.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    6. One May Not Bring to Synagogue Children Who Are Likely to Disrupt
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
It is forbidden for a person praying to seat a baby down in front of him because there is concern that the baby will disturb his concentration (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 96:4). All the more so, during times of prayer services, one may not bring babies and small children who do not know how to pray,
    since they are liable to distract the people praying. Although there is an extra pious custom to bring babies to synagogue so that they can absorb the holy
    atmosphere of the place, that custom refers specifically to times when prayer services are not being held.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In order to emphasize the importance of this matter, I will cite the words of the <em>Shlah HaKadosh</em> who writes in the name of the    <em>Orchot Chaim</em>: "Children's chatter in synagogue is a severe prohibition. Nowadays, their coming to synagogue brings punishment on those who bring
    them there, for they come to desecrate the holiness of our God's house and to laugh in it as they do in city streets. They get up to play with one another;
    this one plays with that one and that one hits the other. One is happy, another crying. One is talking, another screaming. One runs here, the other, there.
    One relieves himself in the synagogue and everyone screams, 'Water, water!' There is one whose father gives him a book and he throws it down on the floor
    or tears it into twelve different pieces. Consequently, the noise their nonsense produces causes the people praying to lose concentration and results in
    the desecration of Heaven's name. Anyone who brings children to synagogue in this way does not deserve to receive a reward for this; instead, he should
    fear punishment. Worst of all, the children will be raised on this bad custom and foreign habit. As they grow older, they will increase their contempt for
    the synagogue and its sanctity, and they will show no respect for the Torah. Additionally, when a person repeatedly sins, [in his eyes] the sin becomes
    permitted. Therefore, when he ages, he will not abandon his ways. In conclusion, it is proper for a person not to bring very small children to synagogue,
    because he will [only] lose from it and not gain. However, when the child reaches the age of understanding, on the contrary; the father must bring the
child to synagogue, teach him to sit in awe and fear, not let him move from his seat, and instruct him to answer <em>Amen</em> and [respond to]<em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em>" (<em>Shnei Luchot HaBrit</em>, <em>Masechet Tamid Ner Mitzvah</em>, also brought briefly by    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 98:3).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One whose child begins to disrupt the congregation's prayer must take him by the hand, bring him outside, and continue to pray there, even if he is in the
    middle of reciting the <em>Amidah</em> (see further in this book 17:15).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    7. Preventing Possible Disruptions in Prayer
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    While reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, one may not hold an object that he fears will fall, such as <em>tefillin</em>, a book, a full bowl, a knife, coins, or
    food, because he will worry that it may drop, and thus his <em>kavanah</em> will be disrupted (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 96:1). Even in other parts of the
    prayer service, like <em>Shema</em> and <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, one must be careful about this. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, one should not hold anything in
his hand while reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, for it is not respectful to stand in front of Hashem while holding something extraneous (see    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 96:1 and 5, based on <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Taz</em>).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Nonetheless, holding a <em>lulav</em> on Sukkot is permitted because it is a mitzvah to do so and it does not disrupt the <em>kavanah</em> in one's prayer.
    Similarly, one is permitted to hold a <em>siddur</em> because it is necessary for prayer (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 96:1-2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
    , one should not recite the <em>Amidah </em>while standing with a knapsack on his back, for that is not a respectful way to appear before important people,
    and all the more so, it is not respectful to pray in that manner. However, if he is already traveling with a knapsack on his shoulders and it is more
    comfortable to leave it on, he may pray with it on him if it weighs less than four <em>kabin </em>(approximately 5.5 kilograms or 12 lbs, 1.5 oz). If the
knapsack is heavier than four <em>kabin</em>, he is prohibited from praying while wearing it because such a load is liable to impair his <em>kavanah</em> (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 97:4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Additionally, if someone holding <em>tefillin</em> or money fears that if he puts these items down they will be stolen, and he does not have a friend there
    to watch them, nor pockets in which to put them, it is preferable, <em>b'dieved</em>, to keep them in his hands while praying, so that he will be less
    troubled (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 96:6; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 7). Likewise, if someone carrying a heavy knapsack on his back is worried that it will be
    stolen, and he has no other choice than to carry it, he is permitted to pray while wearing it.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A soldier carrying a gun, <em>l'chatchilah</em> should not pray with his weapon on him, nor enter the synagogue with it, for it is inappropriate for him to
    pray about life and peace while wearing an instrument intended for killing. However, he may pray with it on him if he is carrying it for security reasons
    or guarding it from theft. If possible, he should take the magazine out of the gun, so that it will be considered less of a weapon. When, for security
    reasons, it is best that the gun be loaded, he is permitted to pray with the magazine inside (see <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 10:8).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person who has a cold must wipe his nose before praying so that he needn't do so during the prayer service. If phlegm in his throat bothers him, he
    should expel it before praying so that it will not distract him during the prayer service (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 92:3). If he must wipe his nose while
    praying, he should do so in the politest way possible. Similarly, if he needs to yawn, he should cover his mouth with his hand. This is because a person
    who stands in prayer must be very careful to show respect for Heaven, and all actions that are considered impolite before people are also prohibited during
    prayer (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 97:1-2).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    8. One Who Must Relieve Himself While Praying
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Chachamim</em> teach that one who needs to relieve himself, be it to urinate or to defecate, is prohibited from praying (<em>Berachot</em> 23a),
since the need to relieve himself is likely to disrupt his <em>kavanah</em>. In addition, it is not proper to come to pray before    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> when one's body is made repulsive by the excrement inside him. Even if he is uncertain as to whether or not he needs to relieve
    himself, it is proper that he try before beginning to pray (<em>Berachot</em> 15a). The <em>Chachamim</em> support their statement with the verse (Amos
    4:12), "Israel, prepare to meet your God." It is also written (Ecclesiastes 4:17), "Guard your foot when you go to the House of God," meaning, make sure
    you do not need to relieve yourself at the time that you are standing to pray.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are two levels of need: 1) a need so pressing that it is impossible to wait even the amount of time it takes to walk a <em>parsah</em>, which is
    approximately 72 minutes; 2) a need to relieve oneself, but which can be controlled for longer than 72 minutes.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If a person begins to recite the <em>Amidah</em> when he cannot control his need to defecate for 72 minutes, his prayer is considered an abomination and he
    does not fulfill his obligation. Instead, he must go back and repeat his prayer after he relieves himself. However, if he recites the <em>Amidah</em> when
    he cannot control his need to urinate for 72 minutes, although it is clear that he did not act in accordance with the law, the <em>Acharonim</em> are
    divided as to whether or not his prayer is considered an abomination. Due to the fact that it is not in our power to settle this dispute, there is no
    obligation to repeat the prayer, but it is good to go back and pray a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>) (see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 92:1, s.v.
    "<em>V'tzarich lachzor</em>").<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If a person is able to control himself for 72 minutes, and he recites the <em>Amidah</em>, his prayer is considered valid because his need to relieve
    himself is not so urgent. In any case, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, even a person who can wait 72 minutes is prohibited from praying. Even if he will miss
    praying in a <em>minyan</em> because of this, he must relieve himself and pray individually. If, however, before he relieves himself, the time to pray will
    pass, he should pray immediately so that he will not miss praying altogether (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 92:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>92:5).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The estimation of a person's ability to control himself can only be determined by the person himself. If he thought before the prayer service that he could
    wait 72 minutes, but after beginning to pray he was proven mistaken, his prayer is still considered valid, since at the time he started to pray he believed
    he could contain his need (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 92:1, s.v. "<em>Shiur Parsah</em>").
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If he has doubt as to whether or not he needs to relieve himself, or if his need is very slight, as we learned, <em>l'chatchilah</em> he should relieve
himself before the prayer service, but he should not miss out on praying with a <em>minyan</em> for that purpose.    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>

<a name="9"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    9. One Who Needs to Relieve Himself Before Reciting Other Matters of Sanctity
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
Just as one who needs to relieve himself and cannot wait 72 minutes is prohibited from reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, so too, he is prohibited from reciting    <em>berachot</em>, saying <em>Shema</em>, and learning Torah, for it is not proper to engage in matters of sanctity when one's body is offensive. However,
    there is a significant difference between the <em>Amidah</em> and other matters of sanctity. In the <em>Amidah</em> we resemble people standing in front of
    the King. If one does not pray in the proper manner, he disgraces the respect of Heaven and his prayer is an abomination. Therefore, when the person
    reciting the <em>Amidah</em> cannot control his need for 72 minutes, his prayer is invalid. This is not so regarding other matters of sanctity. While
    saying them, one is not considered to be standing before the King. Hence, <em>b'dieved</em>, if he recites <em>berachot</em> or <em>Shema</em> even when he
is not able to control his need for 72 minutes, he fulfills his obligation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:6; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "    <em>Afilu B'Divrei Torah</em>"; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 3).<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who can wait 72 minutes, according to most <em>Acharonim</em>, is permitted <em>l'chatchilah</em> to recite <em>berachot</em> and learn Torah, though
    there are those who say that it is preferable for him to relieve himself first (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:7). However, if he must exert himself in doing
    so, he does not need to relieve himself.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person who starts to learn when he does not need to relieve himself, but in the course of learning feels a need, to the point where he can no longer wait
    72 minutes, should <em>l'chatchilah</em> go and relieve himself. If he is in the middle of a subject of study, some say that he may continue to learn until
    he finishes that subject (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 92:2 s.v. "<em>Koreh</em>"; <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 2, p. 338), whereas others say that he should go
relieve himself immediately (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 3:48). If he is teaching Torah, he should finish his class and then relieve himself, for human dignity (    <em>kevod habriyot</em>) is so great that it overrides the rabbinic prohibition of "Do not abominate oneself" (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:7).
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    10. One Who Needs to Relieve Himself in the Middle of Praying
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The ruling regarding a person who does not need to relieve himself when he starts to pray, but in the middle of his prayer feels a rising need, is based on
    how much he needs to relieve himself, and what stage of the prayer he is in. There are three levels of need concerning this law:
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    1. One who can wait 72 minutes is permitted to finish praying.
</p>

    2. One who estimates that he will not be able to wait 72 minutes, but does not yet have to contain the urge, and would have to exert himself slightly to
    relieve himself at the moment - since when he started to pray he was permitted, and his immediate need is not so great, he may finish the section that he
is saying. If the need arises in the middle of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, he should wait until reciting <em>Yishtabach</em>, thereby finishing    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, and then go relieve himself. If the need arises while he is reciting <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, he may, in
principle, finish the <em>berachot</em>. However, because he will need to relieve himself before <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, it is better not to pause between<em>birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>. Therefore, he should relieve himself immediately upon finishing the specific<em>berachah</em> or paragraph that he is reciting (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:9; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>Ya'amid</em>").    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>

    3. One who has to actively suppress the need to relieve himself while praying is in the most serious stage, because at this point he is transgressing the
prohibition, "Do not abominate oneself" (<em>Rama</em> 92:2, according to <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 3:11). If he is saying <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> or    <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, he must immediately go relieve himself since interruption at that point is not so serious. However, if he is in the middle of
    the <em>Amidah</em>, where a pause at that point is serious, and if, when he began reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, he did not feel the need to relieve
himself, he should finish praying. Only in a situation in which he is incapable of waiting at all, should he go relieve himself.    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>

    11. One Who Is Tipsy or Drunk
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person must be clearheaded when he prays. Unlike many idol worshipers who perform their rituals using drugs and alcohol to attain a state of ecstasy, our
    petitions to Hashem are achieved through seriousness and deep thought. That is why the Torah commands the <em>Kohanim</em> not to enter the Temple and
    perform the divine service while inebriated (Leviticus 10:8-11). The <em>Chachamim</em> derive from this that one who is drunk or tipsy is prohibited from
    praying.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    "Tipsy" is the word used to describe someone who is slightly under the influence of alcohol, and finds it somewhat difficult to concentrate and focus his
    thoughts, but is still capable of talking before the King. The word "drunk" is used to describe a person who drank so much that he cannot properly speak
    before the King.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>B'dieved</em>
    , one who prays while tipsy, since he is able to speak before the King, fulfills his obligation. Likewise, if he begins praying and then remembers that he
    is tipsy, he may finish his prayer (<em>Eliyah Rabbah;</em> <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 99:2). However, a drunken person who mistakenly starts to pray is required
    to stop immediately, for the prayer of one who is intoxicated is an abomination. Even if he concludes his prayer, he does not fulfill his obligation. If he
    becomes sober before the permissible time to pray ends, he must go back and pray in accordance with the law (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 99:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Chachamim</em> say that a person who drinks a <em>revi'it</em> (86 ml; recent calculations are 75 ml) of wine is considered tipsy, and if he walks
    a <em>mil</em> (960 meters, approx. 5.97 miles) it will diminish the effect of the wine (<em>Eiruvin</em> 64b). However, we do not know how to compare the
    wine of those days to our wines today. Therefore, the rule is that any time he feels disoriented from wine or alcohol, he is considered tipsy, and when he
    feels his clarity of mind returning, he is permitted to pray (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 99:3; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Rama</em>, because <em>kavanah</em> in prayer has deteriorated throughout the generations, we are not so strict about this law, and
    even a person who becomes slightly inebriated is allowed to pray. This is especially true when one prays with a <em>siddur</em>, for then there is no need
    to worry that he might mix up the words of the prayer. Customarily, we rely on the <em>Rama</em>'s opinion when the permissible time to pray begins to
expire (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 99:3, and 17, and see <em>Kaf</em> <em>HaChaim</em> 22). There are those who add that even to prevent missing prayer in a    <em>minyan</em>, a person who is slightly tipsy is permitted to pray. On Purim, when it is a mitzvah to drink, it is customary to be lenient in allowing
    one who is tipsy to pray so that he will not miss praying in a <em>minyan</em> (see <em>Peninei Halachah Zemanim</em> 16:14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Concerning <em>Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em>, the <em>poskim</em> are divided. Therefore, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, someone who is tipsy or drunk
    should not recite them. Instead, he should wait until the effect of the wine wears off. If, however, the time to recite <em>Shema</em> is about to pass, a
    tipsy person should say the <em>Shema</em> with the <em>berachot</em>, and a drunken person should recite it<em> </em>while omitting the <em>berachot</em>
    (<em>Rama</em> 99:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 8).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A tipsy person may recite other <em>berachot</em>, for example, <em>Birkot</em> <em>HaNehenin</em> (the <em>berachot</em> one recites before deriving
pleasure from something) and <em>Asher Yatzar</em>, but a drunken person should not recite them. Nevertheless, even a drunken person should recite    <em> berachot</em> that he can recite only at that time. For instance, if he became drunk at a meal, he should still recite <em>Birkat HaMazon</em>.
    Similarly, if he relieves himself, he recites <em>Asher Yatzar</em> (<em>Rama</em> 99:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 11).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person who has reached a state of intoxication such as Lot, and is unaware of what is happening to him, is considered a <em>shoteh</em> (a deranged
person), and is exempt from performing all the <em>mitzvot</em>. Even the <em>berachot</em> that he did recite are considered invalid (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 99:11).

            According to the <em>Rishonim</em> who maintain that it is necessary to wash one's hands with a <em>berachah</em> before all prayers, one must use
            a washing vessel, for the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the <em>berachah</em> of washing for prayer following the example of washing before a meal
(see <em>Rambam</em> <em>Berachot</em> 6:2; <em>Ra'ah</em>, <em>Rabbeinu Yerucham</em>, and <em>Rosh</em> who are brought by the            <em>Beit Yosef</em>; see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 4:7 as well). In practice we do not recite the "<em>Al netilat yadayim</em>" <em>berachah</em>
            before <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em>, because the rule is that when there is doubt regarding the recital of <em>berachot</em>, we are
            lenient and do not recite them (<em>safek berachot l'hakel</em>). Nevertheless, it is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> that it is correct to be
            stringent and perform all the other requirements connected to washing one's hands before a meal. Therefore, it is proper for a person whose hands
            are dirty to wash them with a vessel. Even a person whose hands are not dirty can enhance the mitzvah by washing them with a vessel, for perhaps
            the <em>Rishonim</em> who maintain that even a person who does not know if his hands are clean or dirty need to wash them, require using a vessel
            designated for pouring water over the hands. However, those who follow the lenient opinion and wash their hands without a washing cup have on whom
            to rely, for even concerning the washing before <em>Shacharit</em>, the use of a vessel is only <em>l'chatchilah</em>. All the more so before the
            other prayers, when one does not recite a <em>berachah</em> on the washing, and even more so when one does not know if his hands are dirty.

If he is walking on his way and within the four <em>mil</em> ahead of him there is water, he must walk to it and only afterwards pray. The            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 92:7 writes, "A dirty area is [defined as] the [normally] covered parts of a person's body, because they contain beads of
            sweat. For instance, scratching one's head [is considered touching a dirty place]." This refers to rubbing the roots of one's hair, but if someone
only touches the top of his head, he does not need to wash his hands (<em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 162:58, 164:10).            <em>Kaf HaChaim </em>4, small paragraphs 75 and 98, is lenient even if one scratches the roots of his hairs which are not covered with a hat,
            because there is no sweat there. <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>, part 7, 2:14 concludes that if he washed his head and his hair is clean, even a person who
            scratches the roots of his hairs does not need to wash his hands.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Concerning a person who touches other normally covered parts of the body: if his body is washed clean and does not have beads of sweat on it, the<em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to whether or not he must wash his hands. <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> 4:21 is stringent, and            <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 5, 1:4-5, cites <em>poskim</em> who are lenient. According to the <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em>, part 3, 26:10, those who
            wear short sleeves and touch their skin above their elbows need not wash their hands because that part of the body is not one which is normally
            covered. However he also refers to the <em>Chazon Ish</em> who writes that this place is defined as a normally covered part, and that people who
            wear short sleeves should not be taken into consideration. <em>Mor U'Ketziah</em>, section 4 writes that for those who wear short sleeves, above
            one's elbow is not considered a normally covered part. And that is the custom.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
The <em>Rama</em> 92:7 maintains that earwax is considered a covered part and one who touches it is obligated to trouble himself to walk up to a<em>mil</em> to wash his hands. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes that the <em>Gra</em> is lenient concerning this. However,            <em>Otzrot HaGra</em>, p. 219 interprets the <em>Gra</em> differently, saying that he is not lenient regarding this. Similarly, one who touches
            mucous from his nose is surely considered someone who touches a normally covered part and must wash his hands.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Concerning learning Torah and reciting <em>berachot</em>: one who touched normally covered parts can <em>b'dieved</em> rub his hands on his clothes
            and subsequently learn or recite <em>berachot</em>, as clarified by the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 4:23 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:61.

            A person whose <em>kippah</em> fell off and was blown to a distance farther than four <em>amot</em> may cover his head with his hand while walking
            to pick it up. However, while praying and reciting <em>berachot</em> it is not enough merely to cover one's head with one's hand. Since he is
obligated to cover his head, one part of his body cannot be used to cover another part; although his friend's hand may be used (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 91:4; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 91:10; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 6:11-12). Concerning the size of one's <em>kippah</em>: the            <em>Igrot Moshe</em> <em>Orach Chaim</em>, part 1, 1, writes that one can fulfill his obligation by wearing a <em>kippah</em> that does not cover
            the majority of his head even when saying Hashem's Name. By contrast, the <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 7:13 and <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 15:5
            write that when praying and mentioning Hashem's Name, which by law requires a head covering, one must wear a <em>kippah</em> that covers the
            majority of one's head. Nonetheless, in practice, one who is lenient has on whom to rely, since it is a rabbinic ruling and regarding rabbinic
            rulings, the halachah follows the lenient opinion. Furthermore, in <em>Masechet Sofrim</em> 14:15 there is a dispute concerning whether or not one
            is obligated to cover one's head when reciting a <em>berachah</em>. <em>Or Zarua</em>, part 2, 43, writes that the custom of our ancestors in
            France was to recite <em>berachot</em> bareheaded. Although according to most <em>poskim</em> the halachah is that we are obligated to cover our
heads while reciting a <em>berachah</em>, in any case, the lenient opinion is incorporated to strengthen the opinion expressed in            <em> Igrot Moshe. </em>Even so, it is good to be stringent out of respect for the prayer service. Moreover, if one wears a larger <em>kippah </em>
            during the prayer service,<em> </em>this is likely to cause a person to wear it throughout the whole day, thereby sanctifying God's Name and
            accepting the responsibility to observe the Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>.

            <em>Shut Ish Matzliach</em>
            1:24-25 obligates women just the same as men in terms of head covering when reciting God's name. The <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 6, 15 writes that
            single women should not be prevented from reciting a <em>berachah</em> bareheaded; however, it is proper for them to cover their heads while
            praying. As we already learned in the previous note, there are even those who say that there is no obligation for a man to cover his head while
            praying and mentioning God's name. Since it is a rabbinic ruling, and it is customary for women to be lenient regarding this matter, they need not
            change their practice. <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 12:13 writes that according to the <em>minhag</em>, women do not need to cover their heads. He cites
            the explanation given by the <em>Chatam Sofer</em> that since gentile women were accustomed to cover their heads in their houses of worship, there
            is reason to refrain from practicing as they did. All this may be further studied in <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillat Nashim</em>, 10:6,
            note 6.

            The <em>Rishonim</em> are divided into three opinions. The <em>Terumah</em>, <em>Ran</em>, and <em>Hagahot Maymoniyot</em> maintain that no matter
            what the situation, one must wear a belt while praying. In contrast to them, <em>Rashi</em> holds that one need not wear a belt at all for prayer;
rather the important thing is that there be a divider between one's heart and his <em>ervah</em>. The intermediate opinion is that of<em>Rabbeinu Yerucham</em> who maintains that one who normally wears a belt the whole day must also wear one while praying. So it is written in<em>Shibolei</em> <em>Haleket </em>17, in the name of <em>Rav Sa'adyah Gaon</em>, as well as in <em>Magen Avraham</em> 91:1, whom many            <em>Acharonim</em> cite as the way to practice. From the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 91:2 it can be inferred that he rules according to the stringent
            opinion, which is how the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 91:4 is inclined to rule as well. In any case, the <em>minhag</em> is according to those who are
            lenient, and since it is a rabbinic ruling, the ones who are lenient have the advantage. The <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 7:13 explains that in the
            past when people wore robes without belts, they looked unkempt, but today we wear pants, and therefore it is unnecessary to be stringent regarding
            this. Hence, it is an extra pious act to be careful to always wear a belt while praying. The <em>Chassidim</em> enhance the mitzvah even more by
            wearing a special belt for prayer.

            <em>B'dieved</em>
, if he mistakenly prayed without an undershirt, as long as he covered his <em>ervah</em> he fulfilled his obligation. However, the<em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to whether or not a person who does not have an undershirt should pray<em> l'chatchilah</em>. The<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 91:1, s.v. "<em>Yatza</em>" maintains that he may not. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 3 is inclined to agree with the            <em>Levush</em> who rules that he should pray since he is considered to be in circumstances beyond his control (<em>annus</em>).

            According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, it is not necessary to go back and repeat the prayer. However, according to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>,
one must. Many <em>Acharonim</em> are lenient like the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, such as the <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 92:1 and the            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 92:1. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 92:4 is inclined to rule this way as well. Nevertheless, the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>
writes that we do not have the power to resolve this disagreement. The subsequent conclusion is that it is good to recite a voluntary prayer (            <em>tefillat nedavah</em>).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
As for the reason behind this controversy, there are those who maintain that it is contingent upon the root of the prohibition. According to the            <em>Rambam</em>,<em> Hilchot Tefillah</em> 4:1, it is because the need to relieve oneself disturbs one's <em>kavanah</em>. If so, no distinction is
made between urine and excrement and his prayer is considered an abomination. According to <em>Rabbeinu Simchah</em>, who is cited by the            <em>Hagahot</em> <em>Maymoniyot</em>, it is because his body is in a state of repugnancy. Therefore, the prayer of a person who only needs to
            urinate is not considered an abomination, since urine does not have as much contamination. Likewise, the prohibition to distance oneself from urine
            is rabbinic, and from excrement, biblical, as written in <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, chapter 7, 15. <em>Or L'Tzion</em> links this dispute to the
            argument regarding whether or not one who needs to relieve himself is prohibited from learning Torah and reciting <em>Shema</em>. If it is because
            the need is a disturbance, he is only prohibited from praying the <em>Amidah</em>. However, if it is because his body is considered an abomination,
            the prohibition applies to all matters of sanctity. (Nevertheless, an argument can be made that one fulfills his obligation <em>b'dieved</em> if he
            recites matters of sanctity when he cannot control himself for 72 minutes, even according to the opinion that his body is an abomination, because
            he is not considered one who is standing before the King, as is explained later on.) In practice, we are careful to follow both interpretations.

    <div id="ftn8">

            <a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title="">[8]</a>
The <em>Rishonim</em> are divided concerning a person who needs to relieve himself but can wait 72 minutes. According to<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, the <em>Rambam</em>, and <em>Rosh</em>, he is prohibited from reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, and that is what the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 92:1 rules. But the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rashi</em>, <em>Or Zarua</em>, and <em>Agudah</em> maintain that he may pray<em>l'chatchilah</em>. The <em>Chida</em> writes in <em>Kesher Gudal</em> 7:32, that if in order to relieve himself he will miss praying in a<em>minyan</em>, he may rely on those who permit him to recite the <em>Amidah</em> <em>l'chatchilah</em> when he can wait 72 minutes. However, the            <em>Acharonim</em> do not accept his ruling, as clarified by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:5 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 6. There are those who
            write that a printing error was made in the writings of the <em>Chida</em>. See <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 4:19, in the footnote. Nevertheless, when
            one's need to relieve himself is slight, it seems that he can rely on the <em>Chida</em>'s reasoning, especially because there are people who
            always feel a slight need to relieve themselves. If, in order to relieve himself, he needs to exert himself to help push out the waste, then there
is an opinion that he is not at all transgressing the prohibition, "Do not abominate oneself," and he is permitted to pray (the notes of            <em>Rav Eliyahu</em> to the <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 12:3, in the name of an opinion brought by the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Vayetzei</em>
            3). <em>L'chatchilah</em>, a person must try to relieve himself, as explained in <em>Berachot</em> 15a and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 2:6.

            It is implied from <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 92:1, that even if the time to recite the <em>Shema</em> will pass, <em>l'chatchilah</em> he should
            not recite it. However, this matter requires further study since presumably it is better that he recite the <em>Shema</em> so that he will not miss
            saying it (for in this case there is no fear of reciting a <em>berachah</em> in vain).

            However, <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 92:2 clarifies that since he was permitted to pray when he started, he may finish until the end. That is
what is implied in <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 92:6-7 as well. Still, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:9 and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>Ya'amid</em>" explain that he may continue only until the end of the particular part he is reciting, whether it is <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>,            <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, the <em>Amidah</em>, or the like. If he goes on to pray when he cannot wait 72 minutes, his prayer is
            considered an abomination. In order to avoid uncertainty, one should conduct himself according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>. All the more so
when he is violating the prohibition, "Do not abominate oneself," for then according to the <em>Rama</em>, even in the middle of<em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> or <em>Birkot Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em>, he must stop immediately. If at the time he reaches <em>Birkot Keriat</em>            <em>Shema</em> he feels a need to relieve himself and he knows that he can wait 72 minutes, he may continue to pray the <em>Amidah</em>, as I have
            written above in level 1. The reasons for this are as follows: according to all opinions, if he prays in this manner, he fulfills his obligation.
            Similarly, the <em>Rif</em> and <em>Rashi</em> rule that one is even permitted to pray this way<em> l'chatchilah</em>. The <em>Chida</em> writes
            that one may rely on these sources so that he may pray in a <em>minyan</em>. Finally, the <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> writes that if he was
            permitted to pray when he started, he may finish saying all the prayers.

            The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 92:1, s.v. "<em>Hayah</em>" is uncertain regarding the law of a <em>chazan</em> who feels a need to relieve himself
            before <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> and cannot wait 72 minutes. However, concerning a communal Torah reader, he is lenient and rules that he may read,
            for human dignity (<em>kevod habriyot</em>) is so great that it takes precedence over a rabbinic prohibition. Nonetheless, regarding prayer, which
            is considered an abomination, he is doubtful. Thus, even if the <em>chazan</em> will be slightly embarrassed, it is preferable that he goes to
            relieve himself and has someone replace him. Only if the matter will humiliate him greatly may he continue to pray.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:11 states that according to the <em>Rama</em>, when he reaches the point where he will violate the prohibition, "Do
            not abominate oneself," he stops even in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>. According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> he is permitted to continue so
            as not to be humiliated in front of the congregation. The <em>Chayei Adam</em> and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 8, maintain that he is prohibited from
            stopping in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>. That is also the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>. If a person is in a situation where he cannot
control his need to defecate, everyone agrees that he must go relieve himself. However, regarding urination, according to the            <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em>, he should not stop in the middle, even if the urine trickles down his knees. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 8, writes that if
this concerns a lot of urine and he is praying in a congregation, he may stop so that he will not embarrass himself. According to the            <em>Chayei Adam</em> and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 92:11, when he cannot wait, he may relieve himself even just to urinate. That is what I have
            written, as well.

            If he must stop to defecate in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>, it is reasonable to assume that he was probably prohibited from praying when he
            originally started and it was clear that he would not be able to wait for more than 72 minutes. Therefore, he does not fulfill the obligation for
            the parts of the <em>Amidah</em> that he already recited and he must go back to the beginning. However, if he truly thought that he would be able
            to wait 72 minutes, and was surprisingly attacked by such a strong urge to the point where he needed to relieve himself immediately, then if the
            interruption lasted the time needed to pray all of the <em>Amidah</em> prayer, from beginning to end, he must start the <em>Amidah</em> again, as
            explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 104:5 and <em>Rama</em> 65:1. But if the break lasted less time, he continues from the <em>berachah</em> at
            which he stopped. It seems that a person who was unsure of whether he could, at the outset, estimate his ability to wait 72 minutes, and in the end
            could not control his need to defecate, must repeat the <em>Amidah</em> because it stands to reason that he was prohibited from praying when he
            began to recite the <em>Amidah.</em> Furthermore, it is possible that concerning prayer he is considered a repulsive person, based on the logic
            brought by the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 92:2, s.v. "<em>Yoter.</em>"
