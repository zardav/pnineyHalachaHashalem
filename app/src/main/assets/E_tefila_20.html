    Chapter Twenty: <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> - The Priestly Blessing
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Mitzvah of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is a positive biblical commandment for the <em>Kohanim</em> to bless the nation of Israel, as it is written (Numbers 6:22-26), "Hashem spoke to Moshe,
    telling him to speak to Aharon and his sons saying, "This is how you must bless the Israelites. Say to them: May God bless you and keep watch over you. May
    God illuminate His face towards you and be gracious to you. May God bestow favor upon you and grant you peace.'"
</p>
<p>
    This mitzvah is performed daily. Every <em>Kohen</em> who is asked to ascend the <em>duchan</em> (platform) to bless Israel but refuses, even though in
    principle he only nullifies one mitzvah, is considered to have nullified three biblical commandments. This is because the wording used in the verses
    implies that Hashem longs to bless Israel. Therefore, a language of command is employed three times to tell the <em>Kohanim</em> to bless Israel, as it is
    written, "This is how you must bless," "Say to them," and "Place My Name." Hence, a <em>Kohen</em>'s refusal to fulfill the will of the Creator and bless
    Israel is considered a nullification of three <em>mitzvot</em> from the Torah (<em>Sotah</em> 38b; <em>Rambam Tefillah</em> 15:12).
</p>
<p>
    Even if a <em>Kohen</em> who already blessed Israel that day was summoned by another <em>minyan</em> to bless the nation, it is a mitzvah for him to ascend
    and bless again. However, if he refrains, he does not nullify a biblical commandment (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:3).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Sefer Charedim</em> (12:18) writes an important novel insight, that not only the <em>Kohanim</em> fulfill a mitzvah from the Torah by blessing the
    nation, but the Israelites who stand before them in silence with <em>kavanah</em> and respond <em>Amen</em> to their blessing also participate in the
    fulfillment of this biblical commandment.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, we learn to focus on the fundamental fact that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> is the One who bestows blessing upon us, and our
standing each day in readiness for <em>Birkat</em> <em>Kohanim</em> instills this belief in our hearts (Guide to the Perplexed, part 3, chapter 44;    <em>HaAkedah</em>, <em>Sha'ar</em> 74). The more we are aware of the fact that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> is the One who blesses the nation of Israel with
    love, the more we will be open and prepared to accept the blessing (see <em>Sefer HaChinuch</em> 378). Free will is the fundamental component of the world,
    and therefore the blessing that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> bestows upon us is linked to our own efforts. Or, as expressed by the Kabbalah, the awakening
of our will to accept His blessing awakens the Supreme Will to bestow blessing upon Israel in abundance. By fulfilling the mitzvah of    <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, the nation of Israel expresses its will to accept the Divine Influence (<em>shefa</em>) and draws Hashem's blessing into the
    world.
</p>

    <em>2. </em>
    <em>Yisrael</em>
    's<em> Kavanah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    During <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, each and every Jew must stand opposite the <em>Kohanim</em> and have <em>kavanah</em> to accept the blessing. He should not
look at the <em>Kohanim</em> or at anything else, so as not to distract his thoughts from the <em>berachah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:23;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89).<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> established that a <em>Kohen</em> who has an abnormality on his body that would likely cause people to stare at him, and divert
    their thoughts from the <em>berachah</em>, may not ascend to bless the people. Therefore, before the <em>Kohanim</em> became accustomed to covering their
    faces and hands with their <em>tallitot</em>, any <em>Kohen</em> who had a deformity on his face or hands, such as unusual facial freckles or crooked
fingers, would not ascend the <em>duchan</em> to bless the nation. However, today, when all <em>Kohanim</em> are accustomed to covering their faces with a<em>tallit</em>, a defect on one's face or hands does not prevent a <em>Kohen</em> from reciting the blessing. Nevertheless, even today, if the    <em>Kohen</em> has a noticeable deformity on his leg, he should not ascend the <em>duchan</em> to bless the people, for it might distract the minds of the
    listeners. However, if he is a permanent resident of the community, such that his defect no longer makes people curious, he may ascend to bless the nation,
    for it most likely will not distract the listeners (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:30 and 31).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, a <em>Kohen</em> who has a strange accent, such as one who confuses the pronunciation of the letters <em>alef</em> and <em>ayin</em>, may not
    bless the nation, since such a thing will distract the thoughts of the listeners from the <em>berachah</em>. However, a person who speaks in the accepted
    accent, even if he does not emphasize the <em>ayin</em> and the <em>chet</em> properly, does not distract the listeners' thoughts. Likewise, all the known
    accents - Ashkenazic, Yemenite, etc. - do not divert attention from the <em>berachah</em> because they are known and familiar. Only someone who greatly
confuses or garbles the pronunciation more than is acceptable, or stutters excessively, may not bless the people (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:33;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> there).
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the <em>Chachamim</em> enacted that any <em>Kohen</em> possessing something that might distract the people from their <em>kavanah</em> may not
    ascend the platform to bless; from these laws we understand how important it is that the listeners concentrate during <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. The Place Where the Congregation Stands
</h2>
<p>
    When the <em>Kohanim</em> recite the blessing, the people being blessed must position themselves in front of them, as it is written (Numbers 6:23), "This
    is how you must bless the Israelites. Say to them." <em>Chazal</em> interpret this to mean that <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> must be performed in the same way
    that people talk to their friends - by standing face to face and speaking aloud - so that all those receiving the blessing can hear them.
</p>
<p>
    Although the <em>Kohanim</em> reciting the blessing must stand, in principle, those being blessed may sit. Nonetheless, today, the custom is that everyone
    stands for <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. Still, an ill or weak person who has difficulty standing is permitted to sit for the blessing (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    128:51; <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:18).
</p>
<p>
    Anyone standing behind the <em>Kohanim</em> is not included in the <em>berachah</em>, although one who is standing directly beside them can be included as
long as he turns his face towards the <em>Kohanim</em>. People sitting in the first rows of the synagogue must measure their place in relation to the    <em>Kohanim</em>. If they are in front of them or even directly to the side of them, they are permitted to remain in their place and turn their face
    towards the <em>Kohanim</em>. However, if their place is slightly behind the <em>Kohanim</em>, they must move to a different position for the recital of
    the blessing (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:24).
</p>
<p>
    Anyone standing in the synagogue in front of the <em>Kohanim</em> is included in the <em>berachah</em>. Even if there are tall people standing before him,
    separating him from the <em>Kohanim</em>, or if there is a pillar between him and the <em>Kohanim</em>, since he is on the side that is across from their
    faces, he is included in the <em>berachah</em>. However, someone who stands in front of the <em>Kohanim</em> and turns his back to them is not included.
</p>
<p>
    Those who do not come to synagogue due to circumstances beyond their control are still included in the <em>berachah</em>. For instance, someone who has to
    leave for work, or women and children who do not come to synagogue, are all included in the <em>berachah</em>, which is intended to include all of Israel.
    Only those who are able to go and receive the blessing, but neglect to do so, are not included in the <em>berachah</em> (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 128:24
    s.v. "<em>Im</em>").<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Four Biblical <em>Halachot</em>
</h2>
<p>
    There are four <em>halachot</em> specified in the Torah concerning <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>: "It is only recited in the Holy Tongue, while standing, with
    raised hands, and in a loud voice" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:14). When one of these conditions cannot be met, the <em>Kohanim</em> may not bless the
    nation.
</p>
<p>
The first halachah requires that the <em>berachah</em> be recited in Hebrew, the Holy Tongue. Many <em>mitzvot</em> are performed through speech. The<em>Chachamim</em> explained in the <em>Mishnah</em> (<em>Sotah</em> 32a) that the <em>mitzvot</em> of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, <em>Amidah</em>, and    <em>Birkat HaMazon</em> (Grace After Meals) can be fulfilled in foreign languages (see 1:10; 16:9). Nevertheless, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> must be recited
    specifically in the Holy Tongue, as it is written (Numbers 6:23), "This is how you must bless," meaning, in the language in which the Torah is written.
</p>
<p>
    A possible explanation for this is that the purpose of <em>Keriat Shema</em> is to express the foundation of our faith, and therefore the particular
    language in which it is recited is less important than the understanding of what we are saying. Likewise, regarding the <em>Amidah</em>, the essence is
    that we convey our prayer in a comprehensible manner. However, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is a <em>berachah</em> from Hashem to us, and the language in which
    Hashem reveals His will in the world is the Holy Tongue. Therefore, the <em>Kohanim</em> are commanded to recite the Divine blessing precisely as it is
    written in the Torah.
</p>
<p>
    The second halachah is to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> while standing. Therefore, a weak or handicapped <em>Kohen</em> who must sit in a wheelchair, and
    cannot stand on his feet even while only reciting the blessing, may not bless the people. This is because the law of reciting <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is
    similar to the law of the Temple service, as it is written (Deuteronomy 10:8), "To serve Him and offer blessing in His Name." Just as the Temple service is
    performed while standing, so too, the <em>berachah</em> must be recited while standing (<em>Sotah</em> 38a).
</p>
<p>
    A person presents himself fully in a standing position, for in that way he is seen from head to toe, expressing his complete range of abilities, both
    spiritual and practical. In order for the work of the <em>Kohanim</em> and <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> to be fulfilled perfectly, they must be carried out
    specifically while standing.
</p>
<p>
    The third halachah obligates the <em>Kohanim</em> to raise their hands while reciting the <em>berachah</em>, meaning that they must spread their hands out
    over the people being blessed, as it is written (Leviticus 9:22), "Aharon lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them." A <em>Kohen</em> whose
hands tremble and are weak, and who does not have the strength to hold his hands up during the <em>berachah</em>, is not permitted to ascend the    <em>duchan</em> and bless. Even if he is helped in raising his hands, it would be of no use, since the <em>Kohen</em> must raise his hands by himself
    without any assistance (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:52).
</p>
<p>
    Rabbi Nachman of Breslav offers a spiritual explanation of this halachah, stating that the lifting of one's hands conveys the willpower of the heart to
    bless Israel with love. There is a connection and relation between one's hands and one's heart, the proof being that a person's hands are close to his
    heart. Therefore, hand motions are the heart's instruments of expression, as it is written (Lamentations 3:41), "Let us lift up our hearts with our hands
to God in Heaven." When the <em>Kohanim</em> stretch their hands out to bless Israel, they are thereby expressing their heart's great love towards Israel (    <em>Likutei Halachot Nesiat Kapayim</em> 5:3).
</p>
<p>
    Rav Kook adds that raising one's hands forward symbolizes the future, for, indeed, the hands transcend beyond the body. Therefore the <em>Kohanim</em> lift
    their hands to convey the yearning and prayer for an ideal and rectified world (<em>Olat Ra'ayah</em>, part 1, 284).
</p>
<p>
    The fourth halachah commands the <em>Kohanim</em> to recite the blessing aloud so that all the people praying in the synagogue can hear them, as it is
written, "Say to them," meaning, in the manner that a person talks to his friend (<em>Sotah</em> 38a). If the synagogue is small, it is sufficient for the    <em>Kohen</em> to recite the blessing in an average tone, for that is how people normally talk. If the synagogue is large, he must recite the blessing loud
    enough for everyone to hear him, even if he were to recite it by himself. A <em>Kohen</em> who has such a faint voice that it is almost impossible to hear
    him does not ascend to recite the blessing (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:53). However, if there are other <em>Kohanim</em> present whose voices will be
    well heard, it is permissible for the <em>Kohen</em> with the weak voice to ascend with them and bless (see <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 15:21).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. The Connection of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> to the<em> Amidah</em> and the <em>Korbanot</em>
</h2>
<p>
    During the time of the Temple, the <em>Kohanim</em> would recite the Priestly Blessing after the conclusion of the <em>Korbanot</em> service. The Torah
    writes this in reference to the eighth day of the dedication of the Tabernacle, the day the <em>Kohanim</em> began performing their service there. "Aharon
    lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. He then descended from [the altar where he] had performed the sin offering, the burnt offering, and
    the peace offering" (Leviticus 9:22). From here we learn that the people were blessed at the conclusion of the sacrificial offerings. The reason for this
    is that after offering the sacrifices, which express our readiness to surrender ourselves and sacrifice our souls to Hashem, we are worthy of receiving His
    blessing.
</p>
<p>
Outside the Temple, the <em>Chachamim</em> established that <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> would be recited during the prayer service, since prayer replaced the    <em>Korbanot</em>. There is a similarity between the <em>Korbanot</em> and prayer, for in both, one's yearning for Divine closeness is expressed. Just like
the <em>Kohanim</em> recited the blessing after the <em>Korbanot</em>, so it was established that towards the end of the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> the    <em>Kohanim</em> bless the nation.
</p>
<p>
    In order to greatly emphasize the relevance of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> to the conclusion of the sacrificial offerings, the <em>Chachamim</em> established
    that the <em>Kohanim</em> are obligated to start walking in the direction of the <em>duchan</em> at the time of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em>, for that
    is the <em>berachah</em> that discusses the return of the sacrificial offerings. Any <em>Kohen</em> who does not head toward the <em>duchan</em> ("lift his
    feet") at the time of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em> loses the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah and is prohibited from ascending to the <em>duchan</em>
during that <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:8). <em>L'chatchilah</em>, the <em>Kohen</em> should lift his feet in the beginning of    <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em>. However, as long as the <em>chazan</em> did not reach the end of the <em>berachah</em>, the <em>Kohen</em> is still
    permitted to ascend towards the <em>duchan</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:25).
</p>
<p>
    A <em>Kohen</em> who arrives late and realizes that he will not complete the washing of his hands before the conclusion of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em>
    is advised to take a small step in the direction of the <em>duchan</em> while still standing at the sink. With this step he is considered to have started
    to walk towards the <em>duchan</em> during <em>Birkat</em> <em>Retzeh</em>. When he finishes his washing, he continues to walk to the <em>duchan</em> to
    bless the people (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:27, 28; <em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</em> 30;<em> Sefer Nesiat Kapayim Kehilchatah</em> 7:2, note 8).
</p>
<p>
    Because <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is connected to the <em>Korbanot</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> teach that just as the time to bring sacrificial offerings
was specifically during the day, so too, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is recited during the day. Therefore, the <em>Kohanim</em> do not bless the nation during    <em> Ma'ariv.</em> Although presumably there is reason to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> during <em>Minchah</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> decided against
    this since the time of the<em> Minchah</em> prayer is usually after a meal, and there is concern that a <em>Kohen</em> who drank wine at his meal will
    subsequently ascend the <em>duchan</em> to bless the people and desecrate the <em>berachah</em>. It is forbidden for a <em>Kohen</em> who is drunk to work
    in the Temple, and he is prohibited from blessing the people (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:38). However, in <em>Ne'ilah</em>, and during <em>Minchah</em> of
    public fast days, the blessing is recited. Since the <em>Kohanim</em> are fasting, there is no concern of intoxication (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 129:1).
    This is on condition that the <em>Minchah</em> of a fast day is prayed after <em>plag haminchah</em> (a proportional hour and a quarter before sunset), but
when <em>Minchah</em> of a fast day is recited before <em>plag haminchah</em>, the <em>Kohanim</em> do not bless the people.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Washing Hands Before the Blessing
</h2>
<p>
    Before the <em>Kohanim</em> raise their hands to bless the nation, they must wash their hands up to their wrists. There is an allusion to this in the verse
    (Psalms 134:2), "Lift up your hands in holiness and bless Hashem." Any <em>Kohen</em> who did not wash his hands may not bless the people (<em>Sotah</em>
    39a). Eminent <em>Rishonim</em> disagree regarding the reason for this hand washing. According to the <em>Rambam</em> (<em>Tefillah</em> 15:5), the
    obligation to wash one's hands only exists when they are dirty. Therefore, a <em>Kohen</em> who washes his hands in the morning and is careful not to touch
    dirty parts of his body is not obligated to wash his hands again before <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. However, according to <em>Rashi</em> and <em>Tosafot</em>
    (<em>Sotah</em> 39a), even clean hands must be washed and sanctified in honor of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>.
</p>
<p>
In practice, we are stringent, and a <em>Kohen</em> whose hands are clean must also wash them before <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, like the opinion of    <em>Rashi</em> and <em>Tosafot</em>. However, no <em>berachah</em> is recited on the washing even if he touched dirty places before washing, since there is
    doubt whether or not the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted a <em>berachah</em> for it (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:24, based on the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>).
</p>
<p>
    It seems from the <em>Zohar</em> that this washing was intended to sanctify the <em>Kohanim</em>, and their hands, in preparation for the <em>berachah</em>
. In order to increase the level of sanctity, it is customary that a <em>Levi</em> pour the water on the hands of the <em>Kohanim</em>. When there is no    <em>Levi</em> present in the synagogue, it is advisable that a firstborn, who possesses some amount of sanctity, wash the hands of the <em>Kohanim</em>. In
    the absence of a <em>Levi</em> and a firstborn, the <em>Kohen</em> washes his own hands (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:6; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 22).
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>Kohen</em> is concerned that perhaps there will not be water in the synagogue with which to wash his hands before blessing the people, he
    washes them in his house before the prayer service and takes care to keep them clean. In that way he can recite the blessing upon the people. However, if
    the <em>Kohen</em> is not careful to keep his hands clean after the morning washing, and he does not have water to wash them before <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>
    , he may not ascend the <em>duchan</em> to bless the nation.
</p>
<p>
In every situation where the <em>Kohen</em> is forbidden to bless the people, it is advisable that he leave the synagogue before the time of    <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, so that the <em>gabbai</em> will not mistakenly call him up to ascend the <em>duchan</em> when he is not permitted to do so. If
    the <em>Kohen</em> remains present and he is not called, there is concern that perhaps people will think that he is an invalid <em>Kohen</em>.
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. <em>Yisrael</em>'s Participation in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Kohanim</em>
</h2>
<p>
    When the time arrives to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, the <em>Kohanim</em> are not permitted to start the <em>berachah</em> until the <em>chazan</em> or
the <em>gabbai</em> announces "<em>Kohanim</em>." This is because the Torah states (Numbers 6:23), "Say to them," denoting that Moshe, who is not a    <em>Kohen</em>, must tell the <em>Kohanim</em> to bless Israel. Thus we learn that first the <em>Kohanim</em> must be called, and only afterward do they
    begin blessing. If only one <em>Kohen</em> ascends the platform, "<em>Kohanim</em>" is not declared, since it is written, "Say to them" (in plural). Thus,
    the word "<em>Kohanim</em>" is only announced when there are at least two <em>Kohanim</em> present (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 128:10). Some authorities
    conclude that the essence of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is when there are at least two <em>Kohanim</em> to perform the blessing (<em>Rabbeinu Peretz</em>
    brought by the <em>Tur</em> 128; see <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 128:9).
</p>
<p>
    The blessing itself is not recited by the <em>Kohanim</em> on their own. Rather, the <em>chazan</em> recites each word and the <em>Kohanim</em> repeat
    after him. Some <em>chazanim</em> mistakenly recite the words in a quiet voice. That is incorrect. Instead, the <em>chazan</em>'s voice must be heard
    clearly by the <em>Kohanim</em> and should be just slightly softer than theirs (see <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:17; <em>Nesiat Kapayim Kehilchatah</em>
    12:3.) Following each verse, the congregation answers <em>Amen</em>.
</p>
<p>
    As we learned (in halachah 1) the awakening of our will to accept Hashem's blessing awakens the Supreme Will to abundantly bestow blessing upon Israel. In
    other words, when <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> created the world, He established that free will was to be a key component. Therefore only after we awaken
    from below the desire for something positive, a parallel desire from Above awakens to aid us in achieving that thing. Hence, it is necessary that one of
    the <em>Yisraelim</em> being blessed first declares "<em>Kohanim</em>," thereby expressing in words our desire to accept Hashem's blessing, and only then
    the <em>Kohanim</em> begin to bless. Afterwards as well, the <em>chazan</em> must read every word first, and in doing so, express our desire for every
    detail of the <em>berachah</em>, following which the <em>Kohanim</em> repeat that word, and <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> abundantly bestows His blessing
    upon us (<em>Likutei Halachot LaMaharan</em>, <em>Nesiat Kapayim</em> 3:4).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. The <em>Kohen</em>'s Obligation to Remove His Shoes Before the Blessing
</h2>
<p>
One of the nine enactments instituted by Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai (who lived at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple) pertains to the law of    <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. He decreed that the <em>Kohanim</em> must not ascend the <em>duchan</em> to bless the nation while wearing sandals or shoes. There
    are a number of reasons for this enactment, one being out of respect for the congregation, for it is not appropriate for the <em>Kohanim</em> to bless the
    nation with mud on their shoes. Likewise, the Temple services were performed by the <em>Kohanim</em> without shoes, due to the sanctity of the site. The
halachic reason for this enactment is that the laces of the <em>Kohen</em>'s shoes might become loose, causing him to feel uncomfortable standing on the    <em>duchan</em>, which is a high place, where he can be seen by the whole nation. To hide his embarrassment, he would have to bend down and tie his laces,
and the people might misinterpret his bending and not reciting <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> as his admission of not actually being a <em>Kohen</em> (    <em>Sotah</em> 40a).
</p>
<p>
    Based on these reasons, a <em>Kohen</em> may not ascend the <em>duchan</em> with shoes or sandals, nor with slippers that have laces. Regarding slippers,
    if they are made of leather, even without laces, it is prohibited to ascend the <em>duchan</em> in them as well, since ordinary shoes are generally made of
    leather, and all leather shoes are included in the enactment of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai. However, it is permissible to ascend the <em>duchan</em> in
    non-leather slippers that do not have laces.
</p>
<p>
    In a place where it is not customary to appear barefoot, or in sandals without socks, before respectable people, it is proper that the <em>Kohanim</em>
    ascend the platform with socks on their feet (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:18). In a place where it is customary to walk in sandals without socks, even in
    front of respectable people, it is permissible for <em>Kohanim</em> to bless the people while barefooted (<em>Olat Tamid</em> 128:11).
</p>
<p>
    At times, the question arises: what does a handicapped <em>Kohen</em> do if he is unable to take off his shoes, and likewise, what does a <em>Kohen</em> in
    the army do when he does not have time to remove his army boots? In cases of extenuating circumstances like these, some <em>poskim</em> are lenient and
    allow a <em>Kohen</em> to bless the people while standing on the floor of the synagogue, not ascending the <em>duchan</em>, where, because of its
    elevation, their feet and shoes can be seen, and this would bring disgrace to the blessing. If however, the <em>Kohen</em> is standing on the ground at the
    same level as the congregation, there is no prohibition to recite the blessing while wearing shoes. In extenuating circumstances, the <em>Kohanim</em> can
    rely on these <em>poskim</em> and bless Israel on the floor in shoes, provided that their shoes are clean (see <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>,
    part 2, 32, regarding a handicapped person; concerning the issue of extenuating circumstances, see<em> Tzitz Eliezer</em> 14:11 and <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em>
    2:13).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. The Role of the <em>Kohanim</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Kohanim</em> had two main tasks: the first was to educate and teach halachah in Israel, as it is written (Malachi 2:7), "For the <em>kohen</em>'s
    lips safeguard knowledge, and Torah is sought from his mouth." The second was to be messengers of <em>chesed</em> and peace, like Aharon HaKohen, whose
    disciples were taught to "love peace and pursue peace, love thy fellow creatures and bring them closer to Torah" (<em>Avot</em> 1:12). Regarding Aharon
    HaKohen, <em>Chazal</em> relate that he knew how to make peace between friends, and between husbands and wives, and that in his merit thousands of couples
    remained together. Consequently, children were born to them, and they named their sons "Aharon" after him.
</p>
<p>
    In order to enable the <em>Kohanim</em> to develop these two basic qualities, wisdom and kindness, the Torah established that <em>Kohanim</em> would not
receive a portion of land in Israel, and that their livelihood would depend on the produce offerings and priestly gifts of the Israelites. In that way, the    <em>Kohanim</em> would be free to learn Torah, educate the people, and guide them. Since the <em>Yisraelim</em> provide them with sustenance, all the
    people of Israel become partners in the spiritual work of the<em> Kohanim</em>. Due to the fact that they do not own land, and do not partake in the
    competition involved in earning a livelihood, they can more easily develop their love and <em>chesed</em> towards the entire nation.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Ahavah </em>
    (love) is also the basis for <em>Birkat Kohanim.</em> Out of their love to the nation, the <em>Kohanim</em> become worthy emissaries to bless Israel in the
    name of Hashem. The wording of the <em>berachah</em> is as follows: "Who sanctified us with the holiness of Aharon and commanded us to bless His people,
    Israel, with love." The <em>poskim</em> write that any <em>Kohen</em> who is hated by the congregation, or who hates the congregation, or even just one
    person in it, is forbidden to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. If he says the words out of enmity, he will bring danger upon himself. Instead, he must
eliminate the animosity from his heart, or leave the synagogue before <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, since its main purpose is to bless Israel with love (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:37; <em>HaRav Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen</em>, <em>Olat Ra'ayah</em> 2:413).

    10. An Evil <em>Kohen</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The mitzvah to bless the nation applies to all <em>Kohanim</em>, righteous or evil. Therefore, even a <em>Kohen</em> who sins by eating forbidden foods,
having forbidden relations, or committing other sins (excluding those to be outlined in the following paragraphs) is obligated to ascend the<em>duchan</em> to recite the blessing. If he refrains from blessing, he only adds insult to injury. As the <em>Rambam</em> writes (    <em>Hilchot Tefillah</em> 15:6), "Do not tell an evil person, 'Do more evil and refrain from performing <em>mitzvot</em>.'"
</p>
<p>
    It is not surprising how an evil <em>Kohen</em> can bless Israel, because in truth, it is Hashem Who blesses His nation of Israel with love. In order for
    the blessing to be revealed in the world, the <em>Kohanim</em> are commanded to utter the prayer with their lips. Consequently, Israel will strengthen its
    awareness that Hashem is the source of blessing in the world. Since the <em>Kohanim</em> in general are the group granted the holiest tasks from among the
    Jewish people, they were chosen to express the Divine Will to bless the nation of Israel. Yet, the <em>berachah</em> is not dependent on the personal
    righteousness of the <em>Kohen</em> who blesses, but on God's desire to bless His people (<em>Rambam</em> ibid., 7; and see <em>Olat Ra'ayah</em>, part 1,
    p. 283).
</p>
<p>
    However, if the <em>Kohen</em> commits sins which mar his priesthood, the <em>Chachamim</em> penalize him and forbid his ascent to the <em>duchan</em>. For
    instance, a <em>Kohen</em> who marries a divorcee is prohibited from reciting <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. Similarly, a <em>Kohen</em> who is not careful to
    avoid becoming contaminated by the impurity of the dead is forbidden to bless the people. The reason is that since these prohibitions were intended to
    preserve the special sanctity of the <em>Kohanim</em>, one who transgresses them damages his priesthood, and therefore the <em>Chachamim</em> penalize him
    by forbidding him to ascend the <em>duchan</em>. Likewise, he is not called up to the Torah for the special <em>aliyah</em> of the <em>Kohanim</em>.
</p>
<p>
    If he decides to repent, he must first divorce his forbidden wife and vow in public not to marry women who are prohibited to him again. Only after that may
    he resume his priestly task of blessing the people. Likewise, if he was accustomed to becoming contaminated by the dead, he must accept upon himself not to
    do so again (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>128:40-41).
</p>
<p>
A <em>Kohen</em> who worshiped idols is disqualified from reciting <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>. We learn this from the law of the Temple service; just as a<em>Kohen</em> who worships idols is ineligible to perform the Temple service, so too, he is unfit to bless the people (<em>Menachot</em> 109a and    <em>Tosafot</em> there). However, if he repents completely, he may resume his priestly duties and bless the nation (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>128:37).
</p>
<p>
    There are <em>poskim</em> who equate the law concerning one who publicly (meaning in front of ten Jews) desecrates the Shabbat, to the law of a person who
    worships idols, and they maintain that a <em>Kohen</em> who does so is forbidden to ascend the <em>duchan</em>. That is how the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
rules (128:134). However, according to a number of eminent <em>Acharonim</em>, even a <em>Kohen</em> who desecrates the Shabbat is permitted to ascend the    <em>duchan</em>, for a number of reasons. First, it is not clear that the law concerning one who desecrates the Shabbat is, indeed, like that of an idol
    worshiper. Secondly, a distinction must be made between those who desecrate the Shabbat nowadays and those who did so in the past. In the past, it was
    clear that anyone who desecrated the Shabbat publicly did so partly in defiance of the Torah and the <em>mitzvot</em>. However, today, those who desecrate
    the Shabbat do not intend to purposely incite God's wrath. Even if they publicly violate the laws of Shabbat, it is due to a lack of faith and learning,
    and not from an intention to arouse anger and to antagonize. Therefore, a <em>Kohen</em> who desecrates the Shabbat without intending to desecrate Hashem's
    Name and offend the Torah is permitted to ascend the <em>duchan</em>, according to the lenient opinion.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
However, the law regarding a <em>Kohen</em> who desecrates the Shabbat in order to purposely incite God's wrath is different. This includes a    <em>Kohen</em> who participates in organizing communal desecration of the Shabbat. This includes organizing bus rides on Shabbat, partaking in a
    demonstration in favor of opening businesses and movie theaters on Shabbat. As long as he does not repent, he is like an idol worshiper and is deemed unfit
    to ascend the <em>duchan</em>.

    11. A <em>Kohen</em> Who Has Killed Is Ineligible to Ascend the <em>Duchan</em>
</h2>
<p>
    A <em>Kohen</em> who has taken a life may not bless the nation, as it is written (Isaiah 1:15), "When you spread your hands [in prayer], I will turn My
eyes away from you... [for] your hands are full of blood" (<em>Berachot</em> 32b). This means that only hands clean of blood are kosher for reciting    <em> Birkat</em> <em>Kohanim</em>. This is similar to a sacrificial altar, whose stones are forbidden to be shaped using iron, since iron shortens human
    life, whereas the altar is intended to make peace and lengthen human life. Similarly, a <em>Kohen</em> whose hands have been contaminated by blood may not
    bless the people and bestow abundant blessing and peace upon Israel. The task of the <em>Kohen</em> is to augment kindness and life, like Aharon HaKohen,
    who was a lover and pursuer of peace, and a <em>Kohen</em> who has killed has damaged the core of his priesthood.
</p>
<p>
    According to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>Orach Chaim</em> 128:35), no repentance can help a <em>Kohen</em> who has committed murder. Even if he killed
    accidentally, repentance will not do him any good, since a prosecutor cannot become a defender, and hands that have committed murder are forever ineligible
    to bestow <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> upon the nation.
</p>
<p>
However, according to the <em>Rama</em>, if the <em>Kohen</em> fully repents and goes to a sage who will arrange a process consisting of fasting, giving    <em>tzedakah</em>, and accepting upon himself not to sin again in the future, then after concluding the process of repentance, he may resume blessing the
    people. Someone who repents becomes a new person, and therefore, even if he committed murder intentionally, if he completely repents, he may resume
    blessing the people.
</p>
<p>
There is an intermediate opinion which maintains that a <em>Kohen</em> who murdered accidentally and repented may bless the people. However, a<em>Kohen</em> who intentionally murdered someone may not bless the nation even after he repents (<em>Pri Chadash</em>; <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>;    <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 128:35). A <em>Kohen</em> who experiences such a serious incident must go to his rabbi to receive personal advice regarding how to
    practice.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, a <em>Kohen</em> who has unintentionally run over and killed someone with his car may not ascend the <em>duchan</em> for <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>
    . As mentioned previously, the <em>poskim</em> disagree as to whether repentance would be effective. However, if there was no negligence on his part while
    driving - for example, a child suddenly jumped under the wheels of his car and he could not prevent the accident - then in such a case, he is not even
    considered one who kills unintentionally. Rather, he is seen as a person who killed due to circumstances beyond his control, and according to all opinions,
    if he repents according to the instructions of his rabbi, he is permitted afterwards to resume blessing the nation (<em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 5:16).

After <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> some are accustomed to recite a prayer intended for communal recital, "<em>Adir BaMarom</em>," although the            <em>poskim</em> disagree as to when it is recited. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 130:1 maintains that when the prayer to transform and rectify an
            ominous dream into a favorable one (<em>hatavat chalom</em>) is recited in <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, then <em>Adir BaMarom</em> is recited after it,
as can be inferred from <em>Berachot</em> 55b. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 130:9 writes, based on the <em>Zohar</em> that it should not be recited in            <em>Birkat Sim Shalom</em>. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 130:6 writes that there are those accustomed to reciting <em>Adir BaMarom</em> following
            each time the <em>Kohanim</em> bless the nation, and that it is said as the <em>chazan</em> recites <em>Sim Shalom</em>. The source for this
            opinion can be found in the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and <em>Taz</em>. In practice, it is best for every person to follow his own custom.

            <strong> One who is in the middle of reciting <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em></strong>
            <em> </em>
            and is standing behind the <em>Kohanim</em> may not interrupt his prayer to walk and stand in front of them. This is considered as a circumstance
            beyond his control, and therefore he is blessed where he stands. The <em>chazan</em> acts similarly; even when the <em>Kohanim</em> are behind him
            he does not go stand in front of them. Even though walking is not considered a complete interruption during the <em>Amidah</em>, still, it is
            prohibited unless necessary. Therefore the <em>chazan</em> is treated as one who has circumstances beyond his control and is therefore blessed
            where he stands. (The <em>Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim</em>, part 5, 20:23 writes that one who is in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em> should walk in
            front of the <em>Kohanim</em>. Yet, in part 4, 21:2, at the end of his ruling, he writes the exact opposite.)
        </p>
        <p>
            One who is in the middle of reciting the <em>Amidah</em> when the congregation reaches <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> should be silent and concentrate on
            the <em>berachah</em>. Regarding <em>Kedushah</em> and <em>Amen yeheh Shemei rabbah</em>, he is not obligated to stop if he does not want to.
            However, in this case, where some <em>poskim</em> maintain that the Israelites who are being blessed also fulfill a biblical mitzvah, he must stop
            and listen to <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, although he may not respond <em>Amen</em>. If he is at the same part of the prayer as the <em>chazan</em>,
he answers <em>Amen</em> to the three verses of blessing. Still, concerning the <em>berachah</em> recited before them, some say he may not respond            <em>Amen</em>. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 128:79, where he rules this way regarding the <em>chazan</em>.

            Although some maintain that it is permissible to bless the nation even at <em>Minchah Gedolah</em> of a fast day, the majority of <em>poskim</em>
            maintain that the blessing is only recited after <em>plag haminchah</em>. This is because the enactment to bless the nation in the afternoon
            pertains to the <em>Ne'ilah</em> prayer and not the <em>Minchah</em> prayer (on Yom<em> </em>Kippur, the <em>Kohanim</em> do not bless the people
            at <em>Minchah</em>). If <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> in the afternoon would have been instituted for the <em>Minchah</em> prayer, people might think
            that <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> is recited at <em>Minchah</em> of a regular day as well, when it is in fact forbidden for concern of intoxication.
            However, on a fast day in which there is no <em>Ne'ilah</em>, the blessing is recited at <em>Minchah</em>, on condition that it is recited at the
            time of <em>Ne'ilah</em>, meaning close to the end of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though there are various opinions as to how to calculate <em>plag haminchah</em> (a proportional hour and a quarter before sunset, or a
            proportional hour and a quarter before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>), the main calculation is a proportional hour and a quarter before sunset, since
            the opinion maintaining that it is before <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> is calculated based on <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em> (meaning, 72 minutes after sunset,
            as explained earlier in this book, chapter 11, note 14. In other words, <em>plag haminchah</em> according to <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em> is between two
            to eighteen minutes before the visible sunset.) Nonetheless, it is best to start <em>Minchah</em> a little later than that, approximately half an
            hour to three quarters of an hour before sunset, closer to the time of <em>Ne'ilah</em>. This way, <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> will be recited as close
            as possible to sunset.

            Some are lenient so that the children of these<em> Kohanim</em> will not be mistaken for not being <em>Kohanim</em> and subsequently marry women
who are forbidden to all <em>Kohanim</em>. So writes <em>Achiezer</em>, part 4, 3, and what is brought in the name of the <em>Aderet</em>. The            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 1:33 writes that, in principle, one who desecrates the Shabbat is permitted to bless the nation. There,
in part 2, 4 he writes that the <em>Levushei Mordechai</em> is also lenient regarding this. See earlier in this book, chapter 2, note 10, that some            <em>Acharonim</em> allow one who desecrates the Shabbat to join a <em>minyan</em>, since today such a person does not sin intentionally to arouse
            anger.
