    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As we learned (above, 2:2-5), according to most <em>poskim</em>, women
        must pray the <em>Amidot</em> of <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>
        every day, and this is the proper practice <em>le-khatĥila</em>. Hence,
it is important to know when the times of <em>Shaĥarit</em> and<em>Minĥa</em> are. Even the many women who recite only one daily        <em>Amida</em>, be it <em>Shaĥarit</em> or <em>Minĥa</em>, must
        familiarize themselves with the prayer times so they can gauge the
        proper time for <em>Shaĥarit</em> or <em>Minĥa</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The times of the prayers were fixed by the Men of the Great Assembly on
the basis of the corresponding <em>Tamid</em> offerings:        <em>Shaĥarit</em> with the morning <em>Tamid</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>
        with the afternoon <em>Tamid</em>. The time for <em>Minĥa</em> is
explained below (18:1); we will now explain the time for        <em>Shaĥarit</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The morning <em>Tamid</em> could be brought starting from dawn ("        <em>amud ha-shaĥar</em>," when the first light appears in the east),
and the time for praying <em>Shaĥarit</em> should begin at dawn        <em>le-khatĥila</em>. Nonetheless, the Sages said that it is proper to
        recite the <em>Amida</em> after sunrise ("<em>hanetz ha-ĥama</em>"), as
        it is written: "They shall revere You along with the sun" (Tehilim
72:5; <em>Berakhot</em> 9b). <em>Be-di’avad</em>, if one recites the        <em>Amida</em> after dawn but before sunrise, she fulfills her
obligation because she prayed at the time when the morning<em>Tamid </em>offering was brought (SA 89:1; and see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 11 n. 4). The most praiseworthy
        time to pray is when the early saints, the "<em>vatikin</em>," who
        would recite the <em>Amida</em> at the moment of sunrise to fulfill
        "They shall revere You along with the sun."
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The time to pray the <em>Amida</em> lasts four seasonal hours, for that
        is the last time that the morning <em>Tamid</em> offering may be
        brought. <em>Be-di’avad</em>, a woman who did not manage to pray during
the first four hours of the day may pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> until        <em>ĥatzot</em>. Although she does not receive reward for praying on
        time, nevertheless, she does receive reward for the prayer she recites
(SA 89:1). However, a woman who wishes to recite        <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> must not say them after four hours have
        passed, even<em> be-di’avad</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
A woman who customarily prays the <em>Amida</em> once a day, be it        <em>Shaĥarit</em> or <em>Minĥa</em>: if four hours have passed and she
has not yet prayed <em>Shaĥarit</em>, it is best that she pray        <em>Minĥa</em> on that day. However, if she is concerned that she might
forget to pray <em>Minĥa</em>, she may pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> until        <em>ĥatzot</em>.

            2. Seasonal Hours and the Calculation of the Morning Times
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The hours referred to by the Sages are seasonal hours ("        <em>sha’ot zemaniyot</em>"). That is to say, the day is divided into
        twelve equal parts, and each part is called a "seasonal hour." In the
        summer, when the days are long, so are the hours, and in the winter
        when the days are short, the hours are short too.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
The question is: When do we begin to calculate the day? According to        <em>Magen Avraham</em>, the hours of the day are calculated according
        to the hours of light. That is, the calculation begins from dawn and
        lasts until total darkness. According to Gra, the calculation is based
        on the hours that the sun is visible, meaning from sunrise until
        sunset. This explains the two different times that appear in calendars.
        The earlier time follows <em>Magen Avraham</em>’s approach, which
        begins the calculation of the day from dawn, whereas the later time is
        in keeping with Gra’s opinion, which begins the calculation from
        sunrise (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 11 nn. 13-14).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In practice, most <em>poskim</em> follow Gra. Additionally, since the
        time of prayer was established by the Sages, the <em>halakha</em>
follows the lenient opinion, and therefore the latest time for        <em>Shaĥarit</em> is calculated according to Gra.

        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman who is preoccupied with raising her children may fulfill her
obligation to pray by reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. In extenuating circumstances even a woman
without that burden may fulfill her obligation by reciting only those        <em>berakhot</em> (above, 2:4-6). However, a woman who wishes to
fulfill the mitzva of prayer in accordance with the main thrust of the<em>halakha</em> recites <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>,<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, the first two verses of <em>Shema</em>, and        <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> (above, 2:5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If she wants fulfill the mitzva more meticulously, she mentions the
Exodus, in order to fulfill her obligation according to the        <em>poskim</em> who maintain that a woman must commemorate the Exodus
        daily. If she wishes to perform the mitzva of remembering the Exodus in
the best may, she recites the <em>berakha </em>of<em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> and adjoins the <em>Amida</em> to the        <em>berakha</em> on redemption (see below, 16:3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who has more time and wants to enhance the mitzva even further
recites the main parts of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>:<em>Barukh She-amar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em> until the end of the        <em>Halleluyot</em> (six psalms), and <em>Yishtabaĥ</em> (below, 15:4).
One who wants to add more prayers recites <em>Shema</em> and its<em>berakhot</em>. Beyond that, she may add the passages of the        <em>Tamid</em> and the incense before <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> (below,
15:1-2). If she wishes to say more, she may completes all of        <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Nonetheless, it must be reiterated that the mitzva of prayer for women
        in accordance with the <em>halakha</em> is fulfilled in its totality by
        reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, the
        first two verses of <em>Shema</em>, and the <em>Amida</em>. Beyond
        that, women are not obligated. The woman praying must take care not to
allow her desire to enhance the mitzva by adding more passages and        <em>berakhot</em> to ruin her <em>kavana</em> in the main passages of
        prayer. Therefore, if she is concerned that increasing the quantity of
        her prayer will diminish her <em>kavana</em>, she should recite the
        obligatory prayers without adding to them.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        However, in educational institutions, girls should be taught to pray
the whole prayer service: <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>,<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, the passage of the <em>Tamid</em> offering,        <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, the <em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em>
        , and the <em>Amida</em>. Since these girls are single and in an
        organized framework, it is good that their prayers, too, possess an
        enhanced structure and that they become familiar with the entire prayer
        service. Still, after the girls have learned the order of the prayers
        and are accustomed to it, care should be taken to ensure that the
        essence of their prayers is <em>kavana</em> and the request for mercy.
        If the teachers see that lengthy prayers detract from <em>kavana</em>,
        it is proper to let the girls who wish to shorten their prayer to say
        what they are obligated to say without additions.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        When dawn breaks and the time to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> arrives, one
        must stand before his Creator in prayer. He should not place his own
        honor before God’s honor. Therefore the Sages teach that a man is
        prohibited from working, traveling, and eating before he prays.
        Additionally, one must not put his friend’s honor before God’s honor,
        and therefore he must not go to his friend’s house and speak to him
        before praying.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        In principle, this pertains to women as well; however, any woman who is
accustomed to acting leniently by fulfilling the mitzva of prayer with        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> alone must be
careful not to perform these actions before reciting these<em>berakhot</em>. A woman who follows the opinion of most        <em>poskim</em> and prays the <em>Shaĥarit</em> <em>Amida</em> every
morning must refrain from performing these acts before praying the        <em>Shaĥarit</em> <em>Amida</em>. However, in times of need, even a
woman who is accustomed to praying the <em>Amida</em> of        <em>Shaĥarit</em> every morning may rely on the lenient <em>poskim</em>
and may work and travel after reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even a woman who sometimes prays the <em>Shaĥarit Amida</em> and other
        times prays the <em>Amida</em> of <em>Minĥa</em> should try to make
        sure that on the days that she prays <em>Shaĥarit</em> she refrains
        from performing those actions before praying. In times of need, she may
be lenient and perform them after she recites        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        A woman who is about to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> must take care not to
        address her parents or friends prior to doing so. If she does, she
        sins, as she ascribes more importance to their honor than to God’s
        honor, for rather than standing in prayer before God, she first goes to
        greet another person (<em>Berakhot</em> 14a).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        If a woman’s parents require assistance and she has not time to pray
        beforehand, she may go to their aid before prayer, for in doing so she
        fulfills the mitzva of honoring her parents; however, she must first
        recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.
        Likewise, when it is necessary to help people who are ill, and she will
        not be able to pray beforehand, she may assist them before prayer.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        This prohibition is to visit a friend to to ask her how she is;
        however, if her friend comes to her house, she may greet her. If her
        friend does greet her, it is best that she responds "good morning" and
        not "Shalom" so as to remind herself that she has not yet prayed.
        Similarly, girls who pray at school and along their way meet their
        friends are permitted to address them and talk to them, although it is
        best to say "good morning" and not "Shalom."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        When it is necessary to call someone on the phone, be it to ask a
        question or relay a message, one may make a phone call before praying.
        However, it is forbidden to conduct an ordinary friendly phone
        conversation before prayer (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 12:1
        n. 2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is proper that a woman who does not intend to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em>
refrains from greeting her friend before she recites        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.

        <a name="_Toc402175204">6. One May Not Work or Travel Before Prayer</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
As we have learned, a woman who is about to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> must        <em>le-khatĥila</em> follow the same laws as a man, and from the break
        of dawn she may not become involved in her work or do any traveling
        until she prays. The Sages say (<em>Berakhot</em> 14a), "Anyone who
        prays and then goes on his way, God<em> </em>grants him what he
        desires."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Nevertheless, one may perform small tasks or make short trips before
        prayer. There is an opinion that if the trip lasts less than 72
        minutes, it is allowed before prayer. If the entire trip is for the
        sake of prayer, for example, traveling to pray at the Kotel, one may
go, even if the travel time will be more than 72 minutes (        <em>Responsa Or Le-Tziyon </em>2:7:6; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
        12:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Before dawn, one may begin a large project or embark on a long trip,
        for since the time of <em>Shaĥarit</em> has not yet arrived, she is not
        considered one who puts her needs before prayer. She must be strict in
        saying <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> before that, because the time to
        recite them is immediately upon waking up. Since she started her work
        or departed on her journey before the time to pray began, she may
        continue even after dawn, on condition that she prays before the time
        to pray lapses<em> </em>(SA 89:7; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>
        12:2).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is proper that a woman who does not normally pray <em>Shaĥarit</em>
        strictly refrain from occupying herself with work or departing on her
way before reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar </em>and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>.

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman may engage in mitzva acts before praying, for this is no
        affront to God’s honor since these acts are not done for one’s personal
        needs. Therefore, it is permissible and it is a mitzva to bathe and
        clothe children and to prepare food for them before they leave for
        preschool and elementary school. If the house lacks essential breakfast
        foods, it is permissible to purchase them before praying. Similarly, if
        a woman is concerned that after she finishes her prayer there will not
        be enough food left in the store for Shabbat, she may buy food before
        praying (MB 250:1; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>89:25). However, it is
        forbidden to buy even one item if it is not for the purpose of a
        mitzva.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Minor activities are permissible before prayer. For example, one may
        make her bed before praying and she may take the garbage from her house
        to the public garbage bin. Similarly, she may read the newspaper a bit
        and do a little exercise before prayer. She may put laundry that is
        already sorted into the machine and turn it on, since this is
        considered a minor act. However, it is prohibited to sort the laundry
        and then put it into the machine (<em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 2:5).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is forbidden to cook or bake before praying; however, one may light
        a fire under a pot that was prepared the day before or place a
        previously prepared food pan into the oven. Nevertheless, one should
make an effort to recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> as soon as possible after waking up, and it
        is best to refrain from even minor activities and <em>mitzvot </em>
        before then.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        This law forbids engaging in one’s own needs before prayer, including
        getting a haircut and entering a bathhouse (MT, Laws of Prayer 6:7).
        Likewise, it is forbidden to go swimming or take a pampering bath
        before prayer. However, oone is obligated to wash her hands before
        prayer. One should also preferably wash her face and brush her teeth
        before praying (SA 4:17; 46:1). Similarly, one may take a shower and
cleanse oneself with soap as preparation for prayer (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 12: 3-4).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        From the break of dawn, it is forbidden to eat or drink before praying.
        The Sages support their words (<em>Berakhot</em> 10b) on the verse
        (Vayikra 19:26), "Do not eat upon the blood," which they interpret
        <s>
        </s>
        as, "Do not eat before praying for your ‘blood.’" Further, they teach,
        "Anyone who eats and drinks first and [only] afterwards prays,
        Scripture says of him (1 Melakhim 14:9), ‘You have thrown Me behind
        your body ("<em>gavekha</em>," the word used for "your body," alludes
        to "<em>ga’avatekha</em>" – your pride).’ God said, ‘After this person
        acts arrogantly he accepts upon himself the yoke of heaven?!’"
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        However, one may drink water before praying because there is no element
        of pride in drinking it. Similarly, one may eat food and drink
        beverages that are medicinal, as there is no element of pride in taking
        medicine (SA 89:4). For example, someone who is suffering from
        constipation may eat prunes before prayer, since she is eating them as
        medicine (see MB 89:24).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        A woman who is so hungry that she cannot concentrate on her prayer may
        eat before praying, because she is considered like a sick person who
        must eat; her eating does not contain any element of pride (SA 89:4;
        and see MB 26).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        It is proper that women who generally fulfill the obligation of prayer
with the recitation of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> (as explained above, 2:4) be strict not to
        eat or drink before saying those <em>berakhot</em>, in addition to
        reciting them as soon as possible after they wake up.

        may do so. If a small meal without bread is sufficient, that is
        preferable; at their first recess they can wash their hands and eat
bread. The argument should not be made that it is better that they pray        <em>Shaĥarit</em> at home and not eat before <em>Shaĥarit</em> because
        the consistency of prayer in school edifies the students and validates
the status of prayer. Still, it is best to recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> before eating

        generally train minors not to eat forbidden food, this applies when the
        food itself is forbidden because it is not kosher. However, when the
        Sages prohibited eating before prayer or before <em>kiddush</em>, they
        did so as a safeguard. Since the food itself is not forbidden, minors
        need not abide by that safeguard. Nevertheless, <em>le-khatĥila</em> it
        is proper that they do not eat before prayer, though when it is

    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        If the husband of a woman who usually prays <em>Shaĥarit </em>arrives
home from the synagogue before his wife had a chance to recite        <em>Shaĥarit</em>, she should recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, which
        contain a short prayer, and then eat with with her husband. She later
        completes her prayer by reciting <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and praying
        the <em>Amida</em>. This is because a healthy and halakhic family
        context dictates that a woman eats with her husband. Therefore, so as
not to keep him waiting, she eats with him and makes up        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and the <em>Amida</em> after the meal. If
        possible, she should try to say <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> before the
        meal, since one must try to say those <em>berakhot</em> immediately
        upon waking up. This applies if the husband is hurried or pressured.
However, when possible, it is better for the woman to first recite<em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, and the        <em>Amida</em>, and then they can eat together.

There are various opinions about the precise time of<em>amud ha-shaĥar</em>, and they are detailed in<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 11:2 n. 1. As a rule,<em>amud ha-shaĥar</em> is never less than 72 minutes before            <em>hanetz ha-ĥama</em>. Meaning, by the time it is 72 minutes
            before <em>hanetz ha-ĥama</em>, <em>amud ha-shaĥar</em> has
            definitely already occurred.

It is important to know that the earliest time for all daytime<em>mitzvot</em>, such as <em>shofar</em> blowing and            <em>brit mila</em>, is sunrise, because the day is defined by the
presence of the sun. However, <em>be-di’avad</em> if such<em>mitzvot</em> are performed from the time of            <em>amud ha-shaĥar</em>, one’s obligation is fulfilled, because
from a certain standpoint, the day begins from first light (            <em>Megilla</em> 20a).

The Tanna’im disagree about the latest time to bring the            <em>Tamid</em> offering and, consequently, about the latest time
            for <em>Shaĥarit</em>. According to R. Yehuda, it is until the end
            of the fourth hour, whereas the Sages maintain that it can be
            brought until <em>ĥatzot</em>. The <em>halakha</em> follows R.
Yehuda because his opinion is cited in <em>m. Eduyot</em>, whose            <em>mishnayot</em> were chosen as the prevailing halakhic position.
            Therefore, the final time to recite <em>Shaĥarit</em> is at the end
            of the first four hours of the day (<em>Berakhot</em> 27a). Even
            so, according to most <em>poskim</em>, the Sages’ opinion was not
            completely rejected, and <em>be-di’avad</em> it is permissible to
            pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> until <em>ĥatzot</em>. Although one who does
            so is not credited as fulfilling the mitzva on time, she
            neverthelessis credited for her prayer (SA<em> </em>89:1). However,
            R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 8:42) says that
            since there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that according to R.
Yehuda it is forbidden even <em>be-di’avad</em> to pray<em>Shaĥarit</em> later than four hours (see            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 11 n. 16), and because a
woman may fulfill her obligation to pray by reciting only            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, it is preferable that she avoids
            controversy and refrains from reciting the <em>Amida</em> after
            four hours have already passed. Still, he concedes that women
            customarily women pray until <em>ĥatzot</em>, and that this is the
opinion of SA. It seems that women are also permitted to recite<em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and their <em>berakhot</em> before the            <em>Amida</em>. <em>Responsa Maĥazeh Eliyahu</em> 19:14 is careful
            not to urge women to pray within the first four hours of the day,
            due to their preoccupations. Women are considered <em>anusot </em>
            (coerced by elements out of their control) and therefore cannot
            pray on time. This opinion is cited in <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>
            6:20 and <em>Halikhot Bat Yisrael</em> 2:11. I have already written
            what I deem to be the proper practice.

            Concerning <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, the <em>poskim</em>
            disagree about whether one may recite them <em>be-di’avad</em>
            until <em>ĥatzot</em>. Although MB maintains that, for men, one who
            does not recite them due to circumstances beyond his control may
recite them until <em>ĥatzot</em> (see            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 11 n. 7), regarding women,
since they are not obligated to recite            <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> and there is no option to recite
            them voluntarily, it seems evident that it is best for women to
avoid uncertainty and refrain from reciting            <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> after the first four hours of the
            day have passed.

            Similarly, we follow Gra regarding the latest permissible time to
            eat <em>ĥametz</em> on Erev Pesaĥ, because the Sages are the ones
            who established that it is forbidden to eat <em>ĥametz</em> after
            four hours, and when there is uncertainty concerning a rabbinic
            mitzva, halakhic practice follows the lenient opinion. However,
            regarding a mitzva whose time is specified by the Torah, such as
            the mitzva of reciting <em>Shema </em>(which is obligatory for men
            and must be done by the end of the third hour of the day), it is
            proper to follow the stringent approach and recite it before the
            end of the third hour according to MA’s calculation. When there is
            uncertainty concerning a biblical commandment, we are stringent.

            <em>Avot</em>
            2:13 states: "Do not make your prayer fixed, but [make it] a plea
            for mercy and supplication before God." Similar words are written
            in <em>m.</em> <em>Berakhot</em> 4:4. Women especially must be
            meticulous about this, as explained above (3:8-9). For me, the
structured framework of prayer has become more important than            <em>kavana </em>and sadly overshadowed it, and consistency has
            prevailed over supplication; yet, this is the customary practice,
            as it establishes and institutionalizes sanctity within
            communities. However, there is no reason to impose this upon women
as well. Therefore, if extra prayers will detract from her            <em>kavana</em>, it is a case of subtraction by addition.
            Everything we have written about prioritizing extra prayers applies
            to one who will not lose <em>kavana </em>by taking on additional
            prayers.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The prioritization is established in accordance with two
            principles. The first principle is the extent of women’s
            obligation, and the second is the individual significance of each
            part of prayer. Thus, a biblical commandment is of greater priority
            than a rabbinic requirement. Thus, most important is the recitation
of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> (including <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>)            <em> </em>and the <em>Amida</em>, for they are obligatory. Although
it is uncertain whether or not there is a full obligation to recite            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, it is clear that women customarily
            recite them every day, as explained in SA 47:14. Additionally,
            according to most <em>poskim</em>, they have a biblical basis.
            Moreover, they are brief and there is no burden in saying them.
            Therefore, they must be recited with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.
            Concerning the first verses of <em>Shema</em>, although there is no
            obligation to recite them, SA 70:1 rules that it is proper to
            recite them (see below, 16:1). Since they have a biblical basis,
            their significance is well known, and they do not take a long time
            to say, they take priority over other prayers. Next in importance
            is the commemoration of the Exodus, for according to MA, women are
            obligated to remember the Exodus. Although most <em>poskim</em>
            disagree with MA, there is a great mitzva in doing so, for it is a
            biblical commandment, and it can be fulfilled with the recitation
            of just one verse at the end of <em>Va-yomer</em> (the third
            paragraph of <em>Shema</em>). If she wishes to enhance the mitzva,
she can mention the Exodus from Egypt in the recitation of            <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em>, thereby also gaining credit for adjoining
            the <em>berakha</em> of redemption to the <em>Amida</em>, as
            explained below, 16:13. Next in virtue is <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>
            , for there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women must recite
them. Although it is evident that, according to most            <em>poskim</em>, women are exempt from <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>,
            their recitation is a rabbinic command, and the <em>halakha</em>
            follows the lenient opinion (below, 15:4). Still, all agree that
            their recitation is preparation for prayer, and therefore they
precede other passages. One should recite the essential parts of            <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, that is, the <em>berakhot</em> and the
            six <em>Halleluyot</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Next in priority are the rest of the <em>Shema</em> and its            <em>berakhot</em>. Although some <em>poskim</em> maintain that
            women must recite the <em>Tamid</em> passage, in practice it is
            clear that they are not obligated to do so, as explained below
            (15:2). Moreover, this is a matter of uncertainty concerning a
            rabbinic command, in which case the <em>halakha</em> follows the
            lenient opinion. Therefore, it is preferable that whoever has extra
            time recites <em>Shema</em> and its <em>berakhot</em>. Although it
            is clear that women are exempt from them, there is great virtue in
            the recitation of both <em>Shema </em>and its <em>berakhot</em>.
Next in priority is the <em>Tamid</em> passage, a prayer which some            <em>poskim</em> maintain that women should preferably recite. Next
            in importance is the recitation of verses of the incense that are
            connected to the <em>Tamid</em> passage, as explained below
            (15:1-2, n. 1).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Next in priority are the remaining passages and verses of<em>Pesukei De-zimra</em>, which are not the main part of<em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> (see below in 15:5 and            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 14:2 n. 3). There are women who
            wish to enhance the mitzva even more and say the whole prayer
            service in order, from the passage of <em>Akedat Yitzĥak</em> in
            the beginning of <em>Korbanot</em> until <em>Aleinu</em>, as
            brought by <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>70:1.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Perhaps we can suggest that instead of the verses of<em>Birkat Kohanim</em> and the <em>beraita</em> recited after            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, women can recite a verse mentioning the
            Exodus and perhaps the <em>Tamid</em> passage as well, thereby
            fulfilling the obligation according to those <em>poskim</em> who
            maintain that women are required to recite them. After all, it is
            necessary to study Torah right after <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, but
            it is not necessary to recite specifically that <em>beraita </em>
and those verses. Perhaps a verse that mentions the Exodus and the            <em>Tamid </em>passage should be printed in <em>siddurim </em>
            instead.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <em>Berur Halakha</em>
            (Zilber) 1:70 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 7:18 present a different
            order regarding three things. First, they state next in priority
after <em>Emet Ve-yatziv</em> is are <em>Barukh She-amar</em>,<em>Ashrei</em>, and <em>Yishtabaĥ</em> and only then should            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>be
            recited. This is very difficult to explain, for according to
practically all of the <em>poskim</em> the recitation of            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> is obligatory (see above, ch. 6 n. 1).
            Likewise, regarding <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, women are so
            accustomed to saying it that it is considered an obligation (SA
            47:14; see above, 7:3 n. 3). In contrast, women are exempt from the
recitation of <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> according to virtually all            <em>poskim</em>, as explained below, 15:4 n. 2. Additionally, it is
            always proper to say <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, for in extenuating
            circumstances, a woman may fulfill her obligation to pray by
            reciting them, as explained above, 2:5. If they are not recited
            first, in extenuating circumstances one will not recite anything.
The second change mentioned by <em>Berur Halakha</em> and            <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> pertains to <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> and is
            explained below, 15:7 n. 5. The third change is that they maintain
            that <em>Pesukei De-zimra</em> takes priority over the first verse
            of <em>Shema</em>. From my words above, it is clear why I do not
            concur.

            Simply stated, all prohibitions that apply to men also apply to
women, since according to most <em>poskim</em> women must pray            <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Minĥa</em>, as explained above (2:2). Yet
            there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women fulfill their
            obligation of prayer by reciting only <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
            and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, and consequently, after saying them,
they may do other activities. Likewise, according to the            <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women must pray one daily prayer,
            that prayer can be <em>Minĥa</em>, and therefore the prohibitions
            before <em>Shaĥarit</em> do not apply to them. Therefore, it seems,
            a woman who is accustomed to praying <em>Shaĥarit</em> every day
            must be strict concerning all these laws, just as men are. For
other women, it is proper to be strict and to say            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> before
            performing any other actions. However, a woman who is accustomed to
            praying <em>Minĥa</em> as her one daily prayer is presumably
            permitted to perform any action mentioned here, because these
            prohibitions were only instituted for before <em>Shaĥarit</em>.
            Still, it is proper to take care to say <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
            and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> right after waking up; hence, I did
            not make a distinction in their laws. Additionally, if a woman
handles her dealings before <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, there is concern that she will forget to
            recite them. Therefore, it is proper to teach that women must
            recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>
            before engaging in activities, regardless of the case.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Even women who regularly pray<em> Shaĥarit</em> every morning may
            act leniently regarding all these issues before prayer when they
            absolutely must, as long as they recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
            and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> first. This is because it is possible
            to consider the opinions of the <em>poskim</em> who maintain that
            after <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> it is already permissible to deal
            with work matters and travel, as stated by Rema 89:3. Further, some
say that with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>women already fulfill their obligation to
            pray and therefore they need not be cautious regarding all these
issues. It is based on these principles that I write the following<em>halakhot</em>. See also <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OĤ 4:101:2;            <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak </em>4:28:3; <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em>: Prayer

            It is hard to be lenient for boys who have become bar mitzva,
            because their obligation in prayer is explicit. However, concerning
            women, the obligation of the <em>Shaĥarit</em> prayer is
            indistinct, as some <em>poskim</em> say that women are only
            obligated to pray one prayer daily and that they can fulfill their
            obligation by praying <em>Minĥa</em>. Some even say that they can
fulfill their obligation by reciting only            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, as
explained above, 2:3-5. Hence, the prohibitions before            <em>Shaĥarit</em> are indeterminate as well, and as a result, in
times of need, one may be lenient and eat before prayer.            <em>Igrot Moshe </em>4:101:2, and <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 2:4
            state similarly. <em>Halikhot Bat Yisrael</em> 2 n. 10, quotes a
            letter from R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach allowing seminary girls to
            eat in their house before going to school. He adds that they must
say a brief prayer prior to eating (I recommend reciting            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> which they
            must say anyway). Further, he adds that it is good that they accept
upon themselves the yoke of Heaven by saying "            <em>Shema Yisrael</em>."

            According to SA,<em> </em>EH 70:2, it is impossible to obligate a
            husband to eat with his wife more than on Shabbat night, on the
            condition that he provides his wife with her sustenance as he
promised to do when he married her and as is written in the            <em>ketuba</em>. However, according to Rema, based most Rishonim,
            if a woman wants her husband to eat with her, he must eat with her
            every day. It is clear from this that if a man, too, wants to eat
            together with his wife, she is required to fulfill that request.
            Likewise, <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, OĤ 4:101:2 states that a woman "is
enslaved to her husband to eat specifically with him."            <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 16:3 states in the name of R. Elyashiv that,
            practically speaking, a woman who normally prays <em>Shaĥarit</em>
            but did not manage to pray before her husband returned from
            synagogue, must eat with him; therefore she should fulfill her
            obligation to pray by reciting a short prayer, so that he will not
            have to wait for her. R. Auerbach writes that the woman "must do
            what her husband asks of her, because she is subservient to him."
            It seems that this all applies when time is tight or the husband is
            annoyed. However, where possible, it is better for the woman to
            first say <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>,
            then recite the <em>Amida</em>, and then eat together.<em> </em>
