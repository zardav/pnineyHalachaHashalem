    Chapter Seventeen: The<em> Amidah </em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The <em>Amidah</em> Is the Essence of Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Amidah</em> prayer is the pinnacle of the prayer service, and all the other preceding sections are, to a great extent, preparations towards it. The
person praying rises from level to level, from <em>Korbanot</em> to <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and from <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> to    <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, until he can enter the supreme gate of the world of eminence and stand before Hashem in prayer. This is not to minimize the
    importance of <em>Keriat Shema</em>,<em> </em>which is a biblical commandment that we are obligated to recite without any connection to the <em>Amidah</em>
    . Nevertheless, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> with its <em>berachot</em> before the <em>Amidah</em> to serve as
    preparation for it. Through the acceptance of faith in <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em>, and by reciting <em>Birkat Ga'al Yisrael</em>, it
    is possible to rise to the level of prayer in the most complete manner.
</p>
<p>
    Since the <em>Amidah</em> is the pinnacle of the prayer service, the laws regarding it are stricter than those of other prayers. For example, one must
    recite the <em>Amidah </em>while wearing respectable clothing, for during the <em>Amidah</em> we are standing before the King. This is not the case
    regarding <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot.</em> Reciting them, we accept upon ourselves the yoke of Heaven, and we praise Hashem, yet we are not
    on the level of standing before Him (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 74:6; 91:1).
</p>
<p>
    Many <em>halachot</em> that we have learned concerning the proper place for prayer were stated primarily about the <em>Amidah</em>. These include: not to
pray on an elevated place or in an open area; the requirement that there be windows in the place of prayer; that it is a mitzvah to pray in a    <em>minyan</em> in a synagogue; that a person must establish a set place to pray; that there must not be anything separating him from the wall; and that
    one may not pray alongside his rabbi, nor behind him (as explained earlier in this book, chapter 3). Yet, because the<em> Amidah</em> is part of the prayer
service as a whole, we try to observe all these <em>halachot</em> throughout the entire service. However, in a situation in which one cannot recite    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> in accordance with these conditions, he must at least make an effort to pray the <em>Amidah</em>
    in this fashion.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. Three Steps Forward Before the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is customary to take three steps forward prior to praying the <em>Amidah</em>, in order to express one's desire to come closer to Hashem and to stand
    before Him (<em>Rama</em> 95:1). A person who is already standing in his place of prayer does not need to take three steps back in order to return and step
    towards prayer. The fact that he came to synagogue demonstrates that he already brought himself closer to prayer and took more than three steps towards it
(<em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>). Some say that it is proper even for a person who already walked to his place of prayer to step backwards just before the    <em>Amidah</em> and then to take three steps forward again towards his place of prayer (<em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>B'shalach</em> 3; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
    95:7). Between the steps backwards and the steps forward, it is best to pause slightly, so as not to look like someone who is coming and going. Therefore,
    when he arrives at "<em>Tehillot L'Kel Elyon</em>," he takes three steps back, and towards the conclusion of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em> he
takes three steps forward. Similarly, in <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em>, already in the beginning of <em>Kaddish</em> before reciting the<em>Amidah</em>, one takes three steps back and then takes three steps forward to begin the <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Minhag Maharil</em>;    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 95:3).
</p>
<p>
So as not to interrupt between redemption and prayer, it is proper for the person praying to be strict in taking the three steps before the conclusion of    <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ga'al Yisrael</em>, so that immediately after the end of the <em>berachah</em>, he will already be standing in his place of prayer and
    he will begin to say "<em>Hashem sefatai tiftach</em>," the verse which opens the <em>Amidah</em>.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, a person must remove things that might disturb his concentration. One who suffers from a cold should blow his nose
    before beginning to pray, so that he will not need to do so in the middle of his prayer. Similarly, one who has any bothersome phlegm in his throat should
    remove it, so that it will not disturb his prayer (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 92:3; and see earlier in this book, chapter 6). If it is necessary to wipe one's
    nose while saying the <em>Amidah</em>, one must do so in the most polite way possible. Similarly, whoever must yawn while reciting the <em>Amidah</em> must
cover his mouth with his hand. The reason for these laws is that a person standing in prayer must be very cautious of the respect of Heaven (<em>kevod Shamayim</em>), and everything that is considered impolite to do before human beings is prohibited to do while praying (see    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 97:1-2).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. Facing Jerusalem
</h2>
<p>
    During most parts of the prayer service, a person may face in any direction he desires. However, when he arrives at the climax of the prayer service and
gets up in the <em>Amidah</em> to stand before the King of the world, he must turn to face Jerusalem, the place that Hashem chose to endow His    <em>Shechinah</em> to the world.
</p>
<p>
One who stands in prayer outside of Israel must face the Land of Israel, and his heart should be directed towards Jerusalem, the home of the    <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> (Temple), and <em>Kodesh HaKodashim</em> (the Holy of Holies). If one stands in Israel, he must face Jerusalem, and his heart
should be directed towards <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> and <em>Kodesh HaKodashim</em>. If he stands in Jerusalem, he faces the direction where the    <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> stood, and directs his heart to <em>Kodesh HaKodashim </em>(<em>Berachot</em> 30a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:1).
</p>
<p>
Therefore, those reciting the <em>Amidah</em> in the plaza in front of the <em>Kotel</em> must turn and face the direction of the exact place of the    <em>Beit HaMikdash</em>. In other words, those standing in the open square must turn slightly to the left, and even those standing in the men's section in
    the closed area next to the wall should do the same.
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to position the <em>aron kodesh</em> on the side of the synagogue that faces Jerusalem, so that those standing in prayer also pray towards
    the direction of the <em>aron kodesh</em>. However, the primary objective is to pray in the direction of Jerusalem. Therefore, if due to error, or because
    of circumstances beyond our control, the <em>aron kodesh</em> does not exactly face Jerusalem, the people praying should turn to face the direction of
    Jerusalem (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 94:9). Nevertheless, if the entire congregation mistakenly faces the <em>aron kodesh</em>, it is best not to separate
oneself from the congregation; instead, one should stand in the same direction that the congregation faces, but turn his head towards Jerusalem (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 94:10).
</p>
<p>
One who does not know the direction of Jerusalem may pray to whichever direction he desires while directing his heart towards his Father in Heaven (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:3). Even if he subsequently discovers that he was mistaken, it is not necessary to repeat his prayer while facing Jerusalem.    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

    4. Standing and Putting One's Feet Together
</h2>
<p>
During <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> a person is permitted to either sit or stand, but once he reaches    <em>Shemoneh Esrei </em>(the <em>Amidah</em>), he must stand with his feet together. When one stands, he summons his complete being, from head to toe, to
prayer. In addition, his standing expresses his awe and fear toward the King of the world. Therefore, one must not lean against anything while reciting the    <em>Amidah</em>, for anyone who is supported by something even slightly is not considered to be in a state of fear. In extenuating circumstances, for
    instance, when someone is weak and must lean against something, he should try to lean only slightly, such that if the support should be taken from him, he
would remain standing on his own. In that way, although he is not standing in fear, he is at least considered to be praying in a standing position (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:8; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 22).
</p>
<p>
    One must put his legs together so that they look like one. The reason for this is that the separation of one's legs exposes the material side of a person
    and represents the pursuit of worldly matters. Thus, we keep our feet together in prayer just like the <em>Kohanim</em> who, in their ascent to the altar,
    would walk heel to toe to avoid spreading their legs. Furthermore, putting one's legs together symbolizes the annulling of the powers in one's legs,
    demonstrating that we have but one desire, to stand before Him in prayer. <em>Chazal</em> learn this from the angels, of which it is said (Ezekiel 1:7),
    "Their legs are a straight leg," meaning, their legs were placed together so that they appeared to be one leg (<em>Berachot</em> 10b; <em>Yerushalmi</em>,
    chapter 1, halachah 1; and see <em>Maharal Netiv Ha'Avodah</em> 6).
</p>
<p>
    One must put the entire length of his foot next to the other so that they will seem as much as possible as one leg, unlike those who just put their heels
    together (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 95:1; <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>). However, <em>b'dieved</em>, if one prayed with his feet apart, he still
    fulfilled his obligation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 1; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 2).
</p>
<p>
    A person who is ill and cannot stand may recite the <em>Amidah</em> while sitting. If he is unable to sit, he may pray while lying down. However, according
    to a number of <em>poskim</em>, if before the time to pray lapses he has gathered strength and is able to stand, he will need to repeat his prayer while
standing, since the essence of the mitzvah of the <em>Amidah</em> is in a standing position (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:9). Nevertheless, in practice, the    <em>Acharonim</em> agree that whether he prayed sitting or standing, he fulfilled his obligation <em>b'dieved</em> and even if he is able to stand later,
    he is not required to repeat his prayer while standing (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 94:27; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 34).
</p>
<p>
    Even one who must recite the <em>Amidah</em> while sitting or lying down should try to put his feet together and bow his head at the appropriate places.
    When a person sitting in a wheelchair finishes his prayer, he should wheel himself slightly backwards, approximately the distance of the three steps with
    which a healthy person departs from prayer (see further in this chapter, halachah 16).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. Body and Hand Positions
</h2>
<p>
    One reciting the <em>Amidah</em> must lower his head slightly, so that his eyes point downwards in the way of humility; he must imagine himself standing in
    the Temple and directing his heart up towards the heavens (<em>Yevamot</em> 105b; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 95:2).
</p>
<p>
    The kabbalists praise one who prays with his eyes closed. However, even a person who looks into his <em>siddur</em> follows the law <em>l'chatchilah</em>.
Many <em>Acharonim</em> recommend praying from a <em>siddur</em>, so that one can have more <em>kavanah</em> in his prayer (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 95:5;    <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 9-10; and see the words of the <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> brought in<em> Bei'ur Halachah</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Regarding one's hands, the <em>Rambam</em> writes (<em>Hilchot Tefillah</em> 5:4) that a person should place his hands on his heart while interlocked,
    right over left so that he stands as a slave before his master, in awe and fear. That is what the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> writes (95:3) and what is
explained in the <em>Kavanot</em> of the <em>Ari</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 95:12). Many maintain that it all depends on the custom of the place; where the    <em>Rambam</em> lived, it was, indeed, customary to stand before kings and ministers in the manner in which he described. However, people in other areas
    practiced differently. For instance, those living in the countries of Edom were accustomed to standing with their arms folded, and those in the land of
    Ishmael would stand with their hands behind their backs, to symbolically indicate that they do not even have the use of their hands without the consent of
    the one before whom they are standing (<em>Mahari Abuhav</em> brought by the <em>Beit Yosef</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 95:6). Nowadays, according to
this, in addition to what the <em>Rambam</em> wrote, it is also permissible to stand with one's hands adjacent to his body or slightly resting on a    <em>shtender </em>(lectern) next to his <em>siddur</em>, for that, too, is considered standing respectfully. However, one should not stand with his hands
    in his pockets or on his hips, for it is inappropriate to stand that way in front of respected people.
</p>
<p>
Many people are accustomed to "<em>shuckling</em>" (swaying back and forth) while reciting the <em>Amidah.</em> The <em>Rama</em> writes (    <em>Orach Chaim</em> 48; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 95:7) that this is the proper way to pray <em>l'chatchilah</em>, in order to express the excitement and
    trepidation of the prayer experience, and in order to involve one's whole body in the service of prayer, as it is written (Psalms 35:10), "All my bones
    will say, 'Hashem, who is like You.'" By contrast, the <em>Shlah</em> writes that one should not <em>shuckle</em> during prayer, but just the opposite -
    that standing motionless strengthens one's <em>kavanah</em>. Furthermore, he says it is not respectful to <em>shuckle</em>. If a person were to come before
    a human king and begin to shake with his whole body, indeed, the king would immediately dismiss him. If so, one should certainly not act that way in
    prayer. The <em>Shlah</em> explains that the<em> </em>recommendation to sway specifically applies to Torah learning or to singing songs and praise.
    However, in the intense and internal prayer of the <em>Amidah</em>, in which we stand before the King, it is not proper to move at all; only one's lips may
    move (<em>Shlah</em>,<em> Masechet Tamid</em>, <em>Ner Mitzvah</em>). Since each <em>minhag</em> has opinions on which to rely, every person may practice
    in the way that allows him to concentrate the most. This applies especially to a person who became accustomed to <em>shuckling</em> and therefore finds it
    hard to concentrate while standing still (<em>Magen Avraham</em>, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 48:5; and see <em>Kaf Hachaim</em> 48:7-9).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Bowing Down During the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted bowing down in five places in the <em>Amidah</em>: in the beginning and end of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em>, in the
    beginning and end of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Modim</em>, and at the end of the <em>Amidah</em>, when one takes three steps backwards. They specifically chose
    those two <em>berachot</em> for they are the most important, and while reciting them one must try hard to concentrate properly (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    101:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 3). If a person wants to bow down at the beginning or end of another <em>berachah</em>, he is taught not to, so as not to
    uproot the ruling of the <em>Chachamim</em>, and so that he will not look like an arrogant person who considers himself more righteous than others.
However, in the middle of the <em>berachot</em> he is permitted to bow down (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 113:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 2).    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
One bows down when saying "<em>Baruch Attah</em>" and straightens himself when saying "Hashem." At <em>Modim</em>, he bows down when he says "    <em>Modim Anachnu Lach</em>" and straightens up when saying "Hashem" (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 113:7; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 12; for the laws on bowing
    down at the end of the <em>Amidah</em>, see further in this chapter, halachah 13).
</p>
<p>
    The bow must be such that all the vertebrae in one's spine move in place, one after the other, and the vertebrae protrude from his back. One bends his head
    and back until his face reaches the height between his heart and his waist, but he should not bend his head all the way until his belt, because that gives
the appearance of arrogance (<em>yohara</em>). An elderly or ill person who has difficulty bending down lowers his head as much as he is able (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 113:5). One must bow down quickly to demonstrate his desire to bow before Hashem Blessed Be He, and when he straightens himself, he
    must do so slowly, as one who is interested in continuing to bow down before Him (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 113:6).
</p>
<p>
    There are two <em>minhagim</em> regarding the manner of bowing. According to the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Ashkenazim</em>, when one says "<em>Baruch</em>
    " he bends his knees and when he says "<em>Attah</em>" he bows until his vertebrae "click". At <em>Modim</em>, in which the word "<em>Baruch</em>" is not
recited, one bows immediately without initially bending his knees (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 113:12; and see <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 18:1). The    <em>Sephardim</em> practice according to the <em>Ari</em> and bow down in two stages. First, a person bends his body (without bending his knees) and then
    his head. Similarly, when one straightens himself, first he straightens his body and afterwards his head (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 113:21).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Praying Silently
</h2>
<p>
    We learn many essential <em>halachot</em> from the prayer of Chanah, who stood and begged Hashem to remember her and grant her a son. Her prayer was
    accepted and she merited giving birth to Shmuel the prophet, who was the greatest prophet of Israel after Moshe Rabbeinu. As it says, (1 Samuel 1:13),
    "Chanah spoke upon her heart, only her lips moved, her voice was not heard." The <em>Chachamim</em> teach, "'Spoke upon her heart' - from here [we learn]
    that the person praying must direct his heart (have <em>kavanah</em>). 'Only her lips moved' - from here [we learn] that the person praying must mouth the
    words. 'Her voice was not heard' - from here [we learn] that it is prohibited to raise one's voice while praying" (<em>Berachot</em> 31a).
</p>
<p>
    The primary objective of the <em>Amidah</em> prayer is to express the deep aspirations of one's soul before Hashem, and therefore it is not proper to
    recite the words aloud and to manifest these desires and needs outwards. On the other hand, one does not fulfill his obligation with thought alone, since
    every concept must possess a tangible expression in this world. Very often, our inner desires are praiseworthy, but their outer expression is flawed.
    Therefore, our task is to express our inner good will, in actuality. Hence, even the subtlest mitzvah like prayer requires some sort of expression, by
    silently articulating the words with one's lips.
</p>
<p>
    There are different <em>minhagim</em> regarding the proper way to pray silently. According to the majority of <em>poskim</em> and a few kabbalists, one
    reciting the<em> Amidah</em> must utter the words in such a way that only he hears his voice but those praying next to him do not (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    101:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 5-6). According to most kabbalists, the <em>Amidah</em> is so intense and internal that even one's own ear should not hear
the words; instead, he should only mouth the letters with his lips (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 101:8). It is proper that each person follows his family's    <em>minhag</em>, or conduct himself in the way that he can have the most <em>kavanah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>B'dieved</em>
    , even if a person recites the <em>Amidah</em> out loud, he fulfills his obligation. Therefore, if a person who has difficulty concentrating silently is
    praying alone, he may pray out loud. However, in a congregation, he may not recite the <em>Amidah</em> out loud under any circumstances, so that he will
    not disturb the rest of the people praying around him (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 101:2). Overall, it is better that he prays in a <em>minyan</em> silently,
even if he will concentrate less, for prayer in a <em>minyan</em> is accepted (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 101:8).    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the other sections of the prayer service, such as <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, which are not as internal and
    intense as the <em>Amidah</em>, all opinions agree that the person praying must hear the words he is reciting. It is even customary to recite the first
verse of <em>Keriat Shema</em> aloud in order to arouse <em>kavanah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 61:4). Similarly, one must answer <em>Amen</em> and    <em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em> out loud, and one must especially try to respond to the <em>Kaddish</em> out loud as well (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 56:1).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. In Any Language
</h2>
<p>
    It is permitted to recite the <em>Amidah</em> in any language (<em>Sotah</em> 32a). However, it is ideal to pray in Hebrew, for that is the language in
    which <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> composed the wording of the prayers. Furthermore, Hebrew is the Holy Tongue, and is the language in which the world
    was created (see earlier in this book 15:9, that this is also the law regarding <em>Keriat Shema</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, according to the <em>Rif</em>, only when one is reciting the <em>Amidah</em> in a <em>minyan</em> is he permitted to pray in another language. The
    reason for this is that the <em>Shechinah</em> dwells with a <em>minyan</em>, therefore his prayer will be accepted even if it is not in the Holy Tongue.
    However, the prayer of a person who prays individually in a different language will not be accepted. Nevertheless, the majority of <em>poskim</em> agree
    with the <em>Rosh</em>, who maintains that even one praying individually may pray in another language, as long as it is not Aramaic. This is the halachic
    ruling (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 101:4, based on the rule that the halachah follows the last "<em>yesh omrim</em>," <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 18).
</p>
<p>
    An additional advantage to praying in Hebrew, untrue of any other language, is that even if the he does not understand Hebrew, as long as he understands
    the first verse of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, and the first <em>berachah</em> of the <em>Amidah</em>, he fulfills his obligation. In a different language, only
    the person who understands what he is reciting can fulfill his obligation through translation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 101:14 and 124:2; see earlier in
    this book 1:10).
</p>
<p>
    In practice, one who does not understand Hebrew is permitted to choose the language in which he wants to pray. On the one hand, there is a benefit to
    praying in the language that he understands, for it enables him to have more <em>kavanah</em>. On the other hand, if he prays in Hebrew, he merits praying
    in the Holy Tongue (see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 101:4; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 16).
</p>
<p>
    Permission to pray in other languages is granted only as a temporary practice (<em>k'hora'at sha'ah</em>), specifically for people who do not understand
    Hebrew. However, it is forbidden to organize a <em>minyan</em> of people who pray regularly in a different language. That was one of the sins of the Reform
    movement, which translated the prayers to German and caused their children to forget the Holy Tongue, leading the way to assimilation and the abandonment
    of Judaism (<em>Chatam Sofer</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 84 and 86; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 101:13; the <em>Seridei Eish</em> 1:9 prohibits reciting even
    one liturgical poem in a different language).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. <em>Kavanah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    One reciting the <em>Amidah</em> must have <em>kavanah</em>; that is, he must focus on what he is saying, and he must try not to let his mind be distracted
    by anything else during the prayer. If other thoughts enter his mind, he must expel them and return to his prayer. Even if he does not succeed in
    concentrating on all of the words, he must at least try to have <em>kavanah</em> for the conclusion of each <em>berachah</em>. If he cannot concentrate
    during all of the <em>berachot</em>, he must make an effort to concentrate in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em> and <em>Birkat</em> <em>Modim</em>, for those
are the <em>berachot</em> in which we bow down at their beginning and at their end. At the very least, he must have <em>kavanah</em> in <em>Birkat</em>    <em>Avot</em>, the <em>berachah</em> that opens the <em>Amidah</em>.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
If a person recited the <em>Amidah</em> and did not have <em>kavanah</em> during <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em>, he must, in principle, repeat his    <em>Amidah</em>, because the lack of <em>kavanah</em> during that <em>berachah</em> prevents him from fulfilling his obligation. However, as a result of
    the deterioration of the generations and troubles on the mind, our ability to concentrate has weakened. Therefore, the <em>Acharonim</em> have instructed
not to repeat the <em>Amidah</em>, since it is possible that even in reciting the <em>Amidah</em> a second time, he will forget to have <em>kavanah</em> in    <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em> and his repetition will be for naught (<em>Rama</em> 101:1; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4).
</p>
<p>
    A person who is about to finish <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em> and notices that he did not have <em>kavanah</em> in its recital: as long as he has not yet
said Hashem's Name at the conclusion of the <em>berachah</em>, he goes back to "<em>Elokei Avraham</em>" and continues from there with <em>kavanah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 101:4, in the name of the <em>Chayei Adam</em>). If he has already said Hashem's Name, he concludes the <em>berachah</em> with    <em>kavanah</em>. It is good to go back and think the words of <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em> in his heart, for, in the <em>Rambam</em>'s opinion, thought
is considered speech (<em>hirhur k'dibur</em>). However, if he already went on to say "<em>Attah gibor</em>," he continues to pray and must try to have<em>kavanah</em> while reciting the remaining <em>berachot</em>, especially <em>Birkat</em> <em>Modim.</em>    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button><em></em>
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. The Order of the <em>Berachot</em>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>
    is divided into three parts: praises, requests, and thanksgiving. In reciting the first three <em>berachot</em>, we resemble slaves who offer words of
    praise before their master. While reciting the middle blessings we are similar to slaves who make requests of their master. When we recite the last three
    blessings, we are like slaves who gracefully accept reward from their master, then are dismissed and go on their way (<em>Berachot</em> 34a).
</p>
<p>
    We learned this from the prayer of Moshe Rabbeinu, who opened with praise and from there continued to plead and request (<em>Berachot</em> 32a; also see
    the laws of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in this book 14:1). Without the introduction of praise, there is concern that our prayer will resemble the rituals of
    idol worshipers, whose entire aim is to mystically manipulate the higher powers to work for their benefit. In contrast to them, we want to serve Hashem and
    devote ourselves to Him, and all we ask is that He bestows abundant goodness and blessing upon us so that we can reveal His Name in the world. Therefore,
    first, it is incumbent upon us to know before Whom we are standing in prayer. We stand before God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome, the One Who
    sustains life and resurrects the dead, HaKadosh Baruch Hu. With that understanding, we can approach Him and pray with a pure heart for all of Israel and
    for ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    Indeed, in the section of the requests, in which there are thirteen <em>berachot</em>, the general ambitions of the nation of Israel are expressed. They
    are not intended for the individual advancement of the person praying; rather the essence of the requests is about revealing Hashem's glory in the world.
    Even our personal requests for health and livelihood are to allow us to participate in the rectification of the world (<em>tikun olam</em>). The following
are the thirteen themes for which we ask: wisdom, repentance, forgiveness, redemption, health, livelihood, the ingathering of the Jews from the exiles    <em> </em>(<em>kibbutz</em> <em>galuyot</em>), the return of justice, the destruction of those who hate us, the blessing for the righteous, the rebuilding
    of Jerusalem, the re-establishment of the kingship of the house of David, and finally, that our prayers be heard.
</p>
<p>
    After the requests, we end the <em>Amidah</em> with three general <em>berachot</em>, in the center of which is a thanksgiving blessing concerning our lives
and all the goodness that Hashem constantly bestows upon us. Before this, we pray for the return of the Temple services, and after it, we recite a    <em>berachah</em> for <em>shalom</em>, since <em>shalom</em> is the vessel that encapsulates and sustains all the <em>berachot</em>.
</p>
<p>
Here is the place to note that the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> (which means eighteen) is actually comprised of nineteen <em>berachot</em>. At first, when    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em> instituted the <em>Amidah</em>, it was made up of eighteen <em>berachot</em>. After the number of slanderers and
informers increased, following the rise of Christianity, which preached the hatred of the Jews, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted an additional    <em>berachah</em> for the saving of the nation from the hands of the apostates and slanderers.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>
    11. Personal Requests in the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>
    , in their wisdom and Divine inspiration (<em>ruach hakodesh</em>), included all the ideal aspirations of <em>Am Yisrael</em> in the wording of the prayer.
    They meticulously chose every word until a perfect wording was established, with which the Jewish soul can express itself before its Creator in the most
    supreme manner possible.
</p>
<p>
Even so, if a person wishes to add requests of his own in the middle <em>berachot</em>, he is permitted to do so. However, in the first three    <em>berachot</em>, which are intended to praise Hashem, and in the last three, which are intended for thanksgiving, it is prohibited to add personal
    requests, so as not to detract from their general purpose (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 112:1; 119:1).
</p>
<p>
    The personal requests permitted in the middle <em>berachot</em> must be related to the theme of the <em>berachah</em>. For example, if a person in one's
household is ill, one should pray for him or her in <em>Birkat Refa'einu.</em> If a person is in need of a livelihood, he should request that in<em>Birkat HaShanim</em>. If he wants his relatives to make <em>aliyah</em>, he should pray for that in <em>Birkat Mekabetz</em>    <em>Nidchei Amo Yisrael</em>. However, out of all the <em>berachot</em>, <em>Birkat Shome'a Tefillah</em> is special. In it, one may make all types of
    requests. Since it concludes the blessings of request, it includes all of them. When one adds his own personal petitions, he begins reciting the
    established wording, and just before the concluding sentence, inserts his request.
</p>
<p>
    Not only is it permissible to make personal requests, but according to many, it is desirable to do so, since the personal prayers that one adds emerge from
    the depths of his heart and arouse <em>kavanah</em>. Nevertheless, it is advisable not to prolong one's personal appeals in the <em>Amidah</em>, not even
    in the <em>berachah</em> of <em>Shome'a Tefillah</em>, because the essence of prayer is directed towards the needs of the community as a whole, and when
    numerous personal requests are added, the communal character of the prayer is altered. It is best that one who desires to add more personal prayers does so
    after he finishes reciting all the <em>berachot</em> and says "<em>Yih'yu l'ratzon...</em>" since everything recited after that is not considered to be the
    main part of the <em>Amidah.</em> Rather, it is a relevant supplement to the prayer, for as long as he has not yet taken three steps backwards, he still
    stands before the Holy One Blessed Be He (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 119:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 119:12).
</p>
<p>
A person must express his requests in the <em>Amidah</em> properly. Therefore, when praying for an ill person, it is correct to mention his or her name.    <em>L'chatchilah</em>, it is good to mention the name along with the mother's or father's name. However, if the sick person is next to him, it is
    unnecessary to mention his name, for his intention is clear. (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 119:2).
</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>
    12. The Conclusion of the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    In reciting the verse, "<em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em>...," ("May the expressions of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart find favor before You, Hashem, my Rock,
and my Redeemer"), which is said after the blessing for <em>shalom</em>, we end the main part of the <em>Amidah</em>. Therefore, if one hears<em>Kaddish</em> or <em>Kedushah </em>while he is between the <em>berachah</em> and that verse, he may not answer, because that verse is part of the    <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Rama</em> 122:1).
</p>
<p>
However, from the beginning of <em>Elokai netzor</em> until the second time <em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em> is recited, one is permitted to respond to    <em>Kaddish</em>, <em>Kedushah</em>, <em>Barchu</em>, and <em>Modim</em> - like the law regarding one who is in the middle of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>
    - because the person praying has already concluded the main part of the <em>Amidah</em>. Nevertheless, since he did not entirely finish the prayer, he is
prohibited from answering <em>Amen</em> after <em>berachot</em> or anything similar (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> there; and see    <em>Hilchot Birkot Keriat Shema</em> 16:5).
</p>
<p>
    As we have learned, it is in this section that one may extend his supplication and requests as much as he desires, like it is said about Rabbi Akiva, that
when he would pray individually he would prolong his prayer with supplications following the <em>Amidah</em> (see <em>Berachot</em> 31a).    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p>
    Upon the conclusion of the prayers of supplication, the person praying recites <em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em> again and takes three steps backwards. If he cannot
    step backwards because the person behind him is still praying, even though he has not yet departed from the <em>Amidah</em>, he may respond aloud to any
    matter of sanctity, even "<em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em>," since he already finished the supplications after the <em>Amidah</em>. Similarly, he is
    permitted to continue praying, reciting <em>Ashrei</em> and <em>Aleinu L'Shabe'ach</em>, or he may recite Psalms or learn Torah (see further in this
    chapter, halachah 20).
</p>
<a name="13"></a><h2>
    13. Three Steps Back
</h2>
<p>
    Once again, after finishing the <em>Amidah</em>, one must bow down until the vertebrae in his spine protrude, as if they "click." While bowing down, he
    takes three steps backwards. Subsequently, still bowing, he turns to his left side and says, "<em>Oseh shalom bimromav</em>," turns to his right side and
    says, "<em>Hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu</em>," bows down in front of him and says, "<em>v'al kol Yisrael</em>,<em> v'imru Amen</em>," and then straightens
    himself. Many people are accustomed to say afterwards "<em>Yehi ratzon</em>" regarding the building of the Temple. This is because prayer corresponds to
the <em>Korban</em> <em>HaTamid</em>. Therefore, we request that the Temple be rebuilt and that we merit bringing the <em>Tamid</em> offering (    <em>Shulchan Aruch Rama</em> 123:1).
</p>
<p>
The <em>Chachamim</em> say that if a person prays and does not depart from the <em>Amidah</em> properly by taking three steps back and saying    <em>Oseh shalom</em>, it would have been better not to have prayed at all (<em>Yoma</em> 53b). One who fails to conclude in this fashion proves that he did
    not understand that he was standing before the King of Kings, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, and consequently he desecrates the prayer.
</p>
<p>
    When stepping back, one starts by lifting his left leg, the weaker leg, thereby demonstrating his difficulty in separating from prayer. Every step the
    person takes must be the size of his foot. The order of the steps is as follows: initially, he takes a small step with his left leg, so that the toes of
    his left foot are adjacent to his right heel. Afterwards, he takes a bigger step with his right leg, so that the toes of his right foot are adjacent to his
left heel. Finally, he takes a small step with his left leg to equal out the legs. In that way he ends up standing with his legs together when saying    <em>Oseh shalom.</em>
</p>
<p>
    One must be careful not to take a step smaller than the length of his foot, for some <em>poskim</em> maintain that less than that is not considered a step
    (<em>Magen Avraham</em>). When there is not enough room behind him to take three steps, he must step to his side, making sure that every step is big enough
    (<em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 123:5). In a case of extenuating circumstances, when there is no room to step backwards or sideways, he may rely on the opinions
    which maintain that it is permissible to take three smaller steps. However, one may not take less than three steps in departing from the <em>Amidah</em>
before the King (<em>Bach</em> and see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 123:14); nor may one take more than three steps, so as not to display arrogance (    <em>yohara</em>) (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 123:4).<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button> Likewise, it is not proper to take large steps so as not
    to appear as one who wants to distance himself from the King (<em>Rama</em> 123:3; see <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>16).
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>
    14. How Long Must One Stand at a Distance
</h2>
<p>
    After taking three steps backwards, one must remain standing in that place. He may not immediately return to where he prayed the <em>Amidah</em>, for if he
    does, he resembles a dog that returns to its vomit (<em>Yoma</em> 53b). The reason for this condemnation is that after separating himself from the King, if
    he returns to stand before Him, only to wait there without reason, he illustrates that he did not comprehend that he was standing before the King and that
    he already separated from Him. Therefore, his action is considered disgraceful. There are those who continue to err, and upon returning to their places
    they lift their heels slightly as done in <em>Kedushah</em>. However, there is no reason for this.
</p>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
    , one should stand in the place that his steps ended until the <em>chazan</em> arrives at <em>Kedushah</em>, or at least until the <em>chazan</em> starts
    the repetition of the <em>Amidah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 123:2). According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, there is no need to remain standing
    with one's feet together upon the conclusion of <em>Oseh shalom</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 123:6; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> and <em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</em>
    there). However, there are those who say that it is good to remain with one's legs together until he returns to his place. (<em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em>
    18:13; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 123:11 mentions both opinions.)
</p>
<p>
    It is proper that even someone praying individually does not return immediately to his original place, but stops after taking three steps, and waits in his
    place for the amount of time it takes the <em>chazan</em> to arrive at <em>Kedushah</em>, which is approximately half a minute. In extenuating
circumstances, if he must return to his place, he must wait the amount of time it takes to walk four <em>amot</em> and only then return (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 123:11; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 20). The <em>chazan</em> who must begin the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, can <em>l'chatchilah</em>
    wait in the place his steps ended, approximately the walking time of only four <em>amot</em>, and afterwards return to his place, because he is approaching
the <em>Amidah</em> prayer again (<em>Rama</em> 123:2). Similarly, one who must make up a missed prayer, and pray a supplementary prayer (    <em>tashlumim</em>), must wait approximately the amount of time it takes to walk four <em>amot</em> and then return to pray (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    123:11).
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition, it is unnecessary for the <em>chazan</em> to take three steps back again, since his prayer is not completely
    concluded until <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>, in which he requests that his prayers and requests be accepted. At the end of <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em>, he
takes three steps back and says <em>Oseh shalom</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 123:5). Although in <em>Shacharit</em> we recite <em>Tachanun</em>,    <em>Ashrei</em>, and <em>U'va L'Tzion</em> before the <em>Kaddish</em>, and on Mondays and Thursdays the Torah is read, nevertheless, the <em>chazan</em>'s
    separation from the <em>Amidah</em> repetition occurs in the <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> recited after <em>U'va L'Tzion.</em> Therefore, the <em>chazan</em>
    must be strict not to talk from the end of the <em>Amidah</em> repetition until the end of <em>Kaddish-Titkabal</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 123:18).
</p>
<a name="15"></a><h2>
    15. When Is It Permissible to Interrupt the <em>Amidah</em>?
</h2>
<p>
    A person who stands in prayer before his Creator is prohibited from talking about other matters in the middle of praying (see further in this book, chapter
    18, note 1). It is even forbidden to interrupt by walking or hinting. This is learned from the "<em>kal vachomer</em>" principle - if we stand before a
    human king in dread, and are careful not to interrupt with other matters, all the more so (<em>kal vachomer</em>) when we stand before the King of Kings.
</p>
<p>
    Even if the king of Israel were to inquire about ones well-being in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>, it is forbidden to answer him. However, if a
    non-Jewish king, who is likely to execute him if he does not answer, addresses him in the middle of his prayer, he must interrupt his prayer, for saving a
    life takes precedence over prayer (<em>Berachot</em> 30b). If a non-poisonous snake is wrapped around his leg, he may not interrupt his prayer. However, if
a scorpion or poisonous snake endangers him, he must call for help, for saving a life takes precedence over prayer (<em>Berachot</em> 33a;    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 104:1-4).
</p>
<p>
    Walking is not considered a significant interruption. Therefore when one starts to recite the <em>Amidah</em> in a place where it is hard for him to
    concentrate, he is permitted to move to a different place. For instance, if a non-poisonous snake approaches him, creating a situation which disturbs his
    concentration, although the circumstances are not life-threatening, he is permitted to walk to a different place to continue praying with <em>kavanah</em>
    (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 104:10). A similar case is one in which a person is reciting the <em>Amidah</em> and there are adults or children talking around
    him, disturbing his concentration. If by hinting to them they will be quiet, that is the best course of action, for a hint is considered to be less of an
    interruption. However, if they don't comply, he may walk to a different place and continue praying there. Likewise, if the congregation is waiting for a
rabbi to finish his prayer, and this is disturbing his <em>kavanah</em>, he is permitted to hint to them to start <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 104:1).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, if one's child begins to cause a disruption in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>, so much so that he or other people cannot concentrate
    properly, he must hint to him to leave. If the child does not understand, the parent must take him out of the synagogue without talking and then continue
    praying.
</p>
<p>
If during the <em>Amidah</em>, a problem occurs that if not fixed immediately will cause him damage, he is not permitted to interrupt his prayer (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 104:2; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 6). However, if the matter bothers him so much that he cannot concentrate, he is permitted to attend
    to the problem.
</p>
<p>
If a <em>siddur</em> falls to the floor and the person reciting the <em>Amidah</em> cannot concentrate until it is picked up, he must first finish the    <em>berachah</em> that he is saying, and then he may go pick it up. If a person starts praying by heart, becomes confused, and cannot continue, he is
    permitted to go get a <em>siddur</em> and continue praying (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 96:7). If, in the middle of praying the <em>Amidah</em>, a person is
    uncertain regarding a law that may prevent him from continuing, such as a case in which he forgot to recite a particular passage and does not know how to
    continue his prayer, he may peruse through a book to determine the correct practice. If he does not know how to search for the answer in a book, there are
    those who allow him to interrupt with speech and inquire what the halachah is (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 104:2). Likewise, if the telephone rings in the
    middle of his <em>Amidah</em>, he must continue praying. However, if he cannot maintain his <em>kavanah</em>, he is permitted to disconnect the phone and
    return to pray.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
If one's <em>tallit</em> falls off in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em>, but part of it remains on him, he is permitted to fix it. However, if his entire    <em>tallit</em> falls off, he is forbidden to rewrap himself in it, since the act of wrapping constitutes an interruption (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 97:4).
    If being without a <em>tallit</em> disturbs him so much that he cannot concentrate, he may wrap himself in it after concluding the <em>berachah</em> that
he is reciting (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 97:16). Someone else who sees a person's <em>tallit</em> fall off is permitted to put it back on him (    <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 27).
</p>
<p>
While praying the <em>Amidah</em> it is forbidden to respond to <em>Kaddish</em> or <em>Kedushah</em>. However, he may silently concentrate on what the    <em>chazan</em> is saying, and it will be considered as if he himself recited those words - and that is the custom. Nevertheless, if such an interruption
    will disturb his <em>kavanah</em>, he is permitted to continue praying.<button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<a name="16"></a><h2>
    16. One Who Is Traveling When the Time to Pray Arrives
</h2>
<p>
    A person who is traveling in a car when the time to pray arrives, if he is driving, he is forbidden to recite the <em>Amidah</em>. This is because he
    cannot concentrate properly, and there is even concern that he may endanger his life or the lives of others. Therefore, he must pull his car over to the
    side and only then begin to pray.
</p>
<p>
    However, if someone else is driving, who is in a hurry to arrive at his desired destination, a passenger may recite the <em>Amidah</em> while sitting. The
    reason for this is because if they stop traveling in order to pray standing up, he will be distracted with wanting to finish praying quickly, and he will
    be unable to have the proper <em>kavanah</em>. Therefore, it is better that he pray <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> while sitting, since, as we already learned (in
    halachah 4), <em>b'dieved</em>, the one who recites the <em>Amidah</em> while sitting fulfills his obligation.
</p>
<p>
    Even one who is sitting when reciting the <em>Amidah</em> must put his feet together (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 95:2), and try to turn his face in the
    direction of Jerusalem (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 94:15). At the places that the <em>Chachamim</em> instructed to bow down, he must straighten himself
    slightly and bow as much as he can (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:5; <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 18).
</p>
<p>
When traveling by bus or train, both of which are more spacious than a car, if one can stand and concentrate properly, it is better that he stand for    <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>. However, if standing will disturb his <em>kavanah</em>, he must sit with his feet together, stand when he needs to bow down, and
then sit again. At the end of his prayer, he stands and takes three steps backwards (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:5).    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p>
    When one is traveling at night by bus, and he knows that when he finishes his trip he will still have time to recite <em>Ma'ariv</em>, he should pray after
    the trip ends (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:42). However, if he knows that after the trip he will be unable to concentrate properly, because he will be
tired and he will want to finish his prayer quickly, he is permitted to pray while traveling (based on <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 94:5).    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p>
    Reciting the <em>Amidah</em> individually while sitting is only permitted on a temporary basis, during a special trip, or in a set of circumstances
    completely beyond one's control. However, even if it is difficult for a person who travels to work every day to find time to pray while standing, as long
    as he is not in circumstances beyond his control, he is not permitted to be lenient and pray on a regular basis while sitting. Still, it is permitted to
    pray regularly on buses that are specifically arranged for people to pray in a <em>minyan</em> while standing, although, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, one should
    pray in a synagogue. Nonetheless, if those people are hurrying on their way, or rushing to work, and they know that in the synagogue they will pray
quickly, but that on the bus they will pray in a more composed manner, it is better that they pray on the bus.    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>

<a name="17"></a><h2>
    17. One May Not Sit Within Four <em>Amot</em> of a Person Reciting the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Due to the considerable significance and sanctity of the <em>Amidah</em> prayer, the <em>Chachamim</em> prohibit sitting within four <em>amot</em> of a
    person who is praying. One reciting the <em>Amidah</em> is standing before the <em>Shechinah</em>, and anyone sitting there idly is seen as someone who
    does not accept the yoke of Heaven upon himself, thereby desecrating the place of prayer.
</p>
<p>
    However, one who is engaged in a section of prayer is permitted to sit next to a person reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, for since he is engaged in prayer, he
    does not appear as one who does not accept upon himself the yoke of Heaven. Some say that one who wants to learn Torah is also permitted to sit next to a
person praying. In times of need, for instance when a person cannot focus on his learning while standing, it is permissible to be lenient and to sit (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 102:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 6).
</p>
<p>
    If he sat down next to the person praying before that person started to recite the <em>Amidah</em>, although he is neither praying nor learning he is
    permitted to continue sitting there. This is allowed because he does not disgrace the prayer, rather it is the person praying who did not act in accordance
    with the law by beginning to pray within someone else's four <em>amot</em>. Even so, it is, indeed, a righteous act to show respect for the prayer by
    standing up, or at least by learning Torah or reciting Psalms (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Rama</em> 102:3).
</p>
<p>
    A weak or frail person, even when not engaged in prayer, is permitted to sit within another person's four <em>amot</em>, since everyone knows that it is
    because of his weakness that he needs to sit, and therefore there is no offense to the respect of Heaven (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 102:2). On Yom Kippur,
almost everyone is considered to be weak because of the fast, and therefore it is permissible to sit within four <em>amot</em> of a person praying (    <em>Beit Baruch</em> 26:9).
</p>
<p>
There is a stringent opinion which maintains that it is forbidden to sit directly in front of a person praying, even if he is outside of one's four<em>amot</em>, since it causes the person who is praying to appear as though he is bowing down to him. Therefore, even if he is reciting    <em>Keriat Shema</em>, and he sat there before the other person began to recite the <em>Amidah</em>, he must stand. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, it is good to
follow this opinion (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 102:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 9; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 10).    <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
</p>
<p>
    The measurement of four <em>amot</em> is approximately two meters (6.56 feet). To be more precise, an <em>amah</em> is approximately the length of the
    average person's arm. According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, it is approximately 48 cm (18.898 inches), which means that 4 <em>amot</em> is
    approximately 192 cm (75.59 inches). However, there is obviously no need to measure the exact distance from the person reciting the <em>Amidah</em>;
    instead, every person must practice according to his own visual estimation.
</p>
<a name="18"></a><h2>
    18. It Is Forbidden to Pass in Front of People Reciting the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is forbidden to pass within four <em>amot</em> in front of a person reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, since one who passes in front of him is likely to
    disturb his concentration. There are those who say that the reason for the prohibition is that a person who is reciting the <em>Amidah</em> is standing
before the <em>Shechinah</em> and one who passes before him offends the respect for the <em>Shechinah</em>.    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> disagree regarding the question of where precisely is it forbidden to pass. According to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, the prohibition only applies to passing directly in front of the face of one reciting the
    <em>Amidah</em>, since only then will passing by disturb him. In other words, if the width of a man is approximately half a meter (1.64 feet), one may not pass in that half meter in front of his face for a distance of four
    <em>amot</em> (approximately 2 meters or 6.56 feet). However, according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, it is forbidden to pass anywhere the person praying can see within his four <em>amot</em>, since passing there is likely to slightly disrupt his <em>kavanah</em>.

</p>
<p>
    They disagree further. According to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, a person is permitted to come and stand within the four <em>amot</em> of a person praying and remain standing there. This is because he only disturbs the person when crosses through the four
	<em>amot</em> directly in front of his face. However, if he comes from the side and remains standing before him, he does not disrupt him as much. Still according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, it is forbidden to enter into the four
	<em>amot</em> in front of a person praying at all.

    19. The Practical Halachah
</h2>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
, one should be strict, like the opinion of the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, not to walk within the entire four <em>amot</em> before a person reciting the    <em> Amidah</em>. In times of need, however, one may be lenient like the <em>Eliyah Rabbah </em>and permit passing beside a person praying, and likewise
    passing and standing directly in front of his face.
</p>
<p>
    In a case of great need, when there is no other choice, it is even permissible to pass directly in front of a person reciting the<em> Amidah</em>. For
    instance, in order to complete a <em>minyan</em> it is permitted to pass in front of someone who is praying. It is permissible for one who must conduct a
    Torah class, and for a <em>Kohen</em> who must ascend to recite <em>Birkat Kohanim</em>, to pass in front of the person praying. Likewise, whoever fears he
    will miss his bus or ride is permitted to pass as well.
</p>
<p>
However, one who arrives late to the prayer service and wants to pray in his regular seat is prohibited from passing in front of the person reciting the    <em> Amidah</em>. If only one person is reciting the <em>Amidah</em> where he must pass, he may rely on the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> and pass beside him.
    Yet, if in order to do so he must pass alongside a number of people praying, he may not pass, since it is almost certain that he will disturb at least
    someone's concentration.<button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>
</p>
<p>
    If a person is reciting the <em>Amidah </em>while standing in an aisle, since he did not act in accordance with the law by standing in a place that blocks
    the walkway of those coming and going, there is no obligation to take him into consideration, and in times of need, it is permitted to pass before his
    face.<button type="button" id="1018" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 18</button>
</p>
<a name="20"></a><h2>
    20. One Who Finishes Reciting the <em>Amidah</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Regarding someone who finishes the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> while a person remains standing behind him in prayer, the law is as follows: if he is farther
than four <em>amot</em> plus another three steps away from him, so that if he were to take three steps backwards he would not enter into the other's four    <em>amot</em>, he may step back. If he is closer, he may not take steps back until the one reciting the<em> Amidah</em> behind him finishes his prayer.
    Even if the person behind him began praying late and extends his prayer, he is forbidden from stepping into the other's four <em>amot</em>. As we have
    learned, the <em>Acharonim</em> disagree concerning the parameters of the prohibition.
</p>
<p>
    According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, even if the person reciting the<em> Amidah</em> is not standing directly behind him, as long as by taking three
    steps back he will step into the radius of the four <em>amot</em> in front of him, he must wait until the person behind him finishes his prayer. According
    to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, it is only forbidden to step backwards in front of the person praying if he is standing directly in front of him. But if the
person praying is not exactly in front of him, he is permitted to take three steps back. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, it is good to practice like the    <em>Magen Avraham</em>, though in times of need one may be lenient like the opinion of the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:18-19).
    Even in a situation in which the person praying is directly behind him, in extenuating circumstances he may step backwards diagonally, for there are those
    who explain that according to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, as long as his steps do not bring him closer to the person praying, he is permitted to step back
    (brought in the name of the <em>Chazon Ish</em> in the book <em>Four Amot of Prayer</em>, p. 50 and 363).
</p>
<p>
    <img width="100%" height="auto" src="images/E_tefila_17_3.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    If between him and the person reciting the<em> Amidah</em> stands a person who already finished his prayer, he is permitted to step backwards, since the
    one who already concluded his prayer constitutes a divider between them, even if the one dividing did not take three steps back yet.
</p>
<p>
    In times of need it is also permitted to be lenient when there is a partition that is at least ten <em>tefachim</em> (80 cm; 2.62 feet) high and at least
    four <em>tefachim</em> (32 cm; 12.598 inches) wide between him and the person reciting the<em> Amidah</em>. Those who wish to be lenient are permitted to
regard the big permanent benches in the synagogues as a partition, since their height is at least ten <em>tefachim</em>.    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
</p>
<p>
Regarding one who cannot step backwards because of the person reciting the<em> Amidah</em> behind him, although he has not yet separated from the<em>Amidah</em>, he is permitted to answer <em>Amen</em> and <em>Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo</em> and to recite all the prayers. If the congregation reaches    <em>Tachanun</em>, he is permitted to sit and recite it, on condition that he does not sit directly in front of the other's face.15 After that, he stands
again in his place and when the person praying behind him concludes his prayer, he can take three steps backwards and say <em>Oseh shalom</em> (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 122:4 and see 104:9; also see earlier in this chapter, halachah 13).
</p>
<p>
    21. Additional Details of Certain Laws
</p>
<p>
    As we have learned, <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is proper to be stringent like the opinion of the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, and refrain from taking three steps
    within the four <em>amot</em> in front of a person reciting the<em> Amidah</em>, even if the one praying is not directly behind him.
</p>
<p>
    However, there are times when a person prolonging his prayer becomes distracted from the thought that he is preventing the person in front of him from
    taking three steps backwards. When the person who is waiting senses that, it is best that he follow the opinion of the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, who states
    that if the person praying is not directly behind him he may take three steps back.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, one who usually prolongs his <em>Amidah</em> is permitted to request of the people praying in front of him not to wait for him until he
    finishes. Then they will be permitted to step backwards immediately upon the conclusion of their prayer. One who prays directly in front of him should walk
    back diagonally, so as not to step directly in front of him.<button type="button" id="1020" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 20</button>
</p>
<p>
    When someone reciting the <em>Amidah</em> is standing behind the <em>chazan</em> and the time for <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> arrives, the <em>chazan</em>
    should practice according to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, who maintains that as long as he is not directly in front of him, he may step backwards. If he is
directly in front of him, he should step back diagonally and then return to his place to repeat the <em>Amidah</em>.    <button type="button" id="1021" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 21</button>
</p>
<p>
    In general, when a person knows that he tends to prolong his prayer, it is proper for him not to stand behind another and cause him anguish. Likewise, he
    should take care not to pray behind the <em>chazan</em> or the rabbi, and trouble them to wait for him (see earlier in this book 3:7 concerning the
    prohibition against praying behind one's rabbi).
</p>
<p>
    Just as it is forbidden to pass in front of the person reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, one must also refrain from passing in front of the <em>chazan</em>
    during <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>, and before someone who is reciting <em>Kaddish</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 55:9).
</p>
<p>
The <em>Acharonim</em> disagree as to whether or not the law regarding an adult, namely, that it is forbidden to step before him and sit within his four    <em>amot</em>, also applies to a minor (see the book <em>Four Amot of Prayer</em>,<em> </em>pp. 254-257). Since this is a rabbinic ruling, the halachah
    follows the lenient opinions, yet those who are stringent enhance the mitzvah.

            The <em>chazan</em> also opens the repetition of the <em>Amidah</em> with this verse. According to the Sephardic custom, it is said aloud, but
            according to the custom of the <em>Ashkenazim</em>, it is recited silently (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 111:10; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 10).
        </p>
        <p>
In <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Musaf</em>, <em>Ashkenazim</em> are accustomed to reciting "<em>Ki Shem Hashem ekra</em>..." before "            <em>Hashem sefatai</em>." If someone forgot and started "<em>Hashem sefatai</em>," he does not go back and say "<em>Ki Shem Hashem ekra</em>,"
            since by reciting the verse "<em>Hashem sefatai tiftach</em>" he already began the <em>Amidah</em>. So writes <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 23 note 62.
            The <em>Bei'ur Halachah </em>111:2 s.v. "<em>Chozer</em>" writes that if he prayed without the verse "<em>Hashem sefatai tiftach</em>," he still
fulfilled his obligation, since it does not detract from the essence of the <em>Amidah</em>. (The <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>,<em> </em>part 5, 24:8 maintains that he must go back and start again.) <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> p. 278 brings support for the            <em>Bei'ur Halachah </em>from the words of the <em>Eshkol</em> and the <em>Ohel Mo'ed</em>. And that is the halachah.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 94:10 discusses the case of a person who mistakenly starts praying in the wrong direction. If he is in the synagogue
            and is embarrassed in front of the congregation, he can move and turn to face Jerusalem. However, if he is not embarrassed, he should remain in his
            place, for it is more important not to move during the <em>Amidah</em> prayer. The <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Yitro</em> 1, writes that if he is in
the synagogue, he must always turn to face Jerusalem. However, if he is praying alone in his house, he should continue praying as he started. See            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 7, who writes that if he mistakenly started praying towards the west and his back is to Jerusalem, even if he is praying
            alone, he must turn himself to the direction of Jerusalem.

            <em>Berachot</em>
34b clarifies that bowing down in the thanks of <em>Hallel</em> and in the thanks of <em>Birkat HaMazon</em> is disgraceful.<em>Rabbeinu Yerucham</em> adds that one does not bow down at the words "<em>V'chol komah lefanecha tishtachaveh</em>" and<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> add not to bow down at "<em>Lecha levadcha anachnu modim</em>" in <em>Nishmat Kol Chai</em>. So rules the            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 113:3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding bowing at <em>Barchu</em>, there are various customs. The crux of the issue lies in the reason <em>chachamim</em> taught not to bow at
            the aforementioned places. If the reason is because he is bowing at a place in which the <em>Chachamim</em> did not institute bowing, then it is
            forbidden to bow regularly at <em>Barchu</em>. That is what is written in <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 5:13 and <em>She'erit Yosef</em>, part 2, p.
            106, and that is the <em>minhag</em> of Sephardic rabbis; still, among the Sephardic communities, many are accustomed to bowing. However, if the
reason not to bow is because by bowing at the expression of thanks (<em>hoda'ah</em>), he is demonstrating that he erred, (thinking that the word            <em>hoda'ah</em> means prostration when it is really an expression of thanks), then if he is bowing in a different place in the prayer service in
            order to accept upon himself the yoke of Hashem's kingdom, there is no flaw in that; therefore, he is permitted to bow regularly at <em>Barchu</em>
            . That is what is written in <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 113:3, and that is the Ashkenazic custom. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> brings support
            for this. In a place where all different Jewish ethnic groups pray together, it is proper that everyone bows slightly at <em>Barchu</em> so as not
            to magnify the division between the <em>minhagim</em>, for that is how most of Israel practices, thereby preserving the custom of prostration to a
            certain extent. Also, in that way, no additional bows are added to those instituted by the <em>Chachamim</em>, for this kind of bow is not a
            complete bow that requires the vertebrae in one's spine to click.

            On the High Holy Days, when everyone has <em>machzorim</em>, whoever has difficulty concentrating silently is permitted to raise his voice
            slightly, provided that he does not disturb the neighboring congregants (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 101:3). However, in a place in which the custom is
            to pray silently even on the High Holy Days, one who raises his voice will most definitely disturb the other people praying. Even in a place in
            which people pray out loud during those days, it is forbidden to shout out one's prayer, for one who does so, behaves like the false prophets who
            think that their gods are hard of hearing and that one must yell in order to be heard (<em>Berachot</em> 24b).

101:1 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 1-3. If he is so troubled that he knows that he will not be able to concentrate even for <em>Birkat</em><em>Avot</em>, he may not recite the <em>Amidah</em>. Although a situation in which a person knows ahead of time that he cannot concentrate in<em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em> is uncommon, the principle is that one may not pray knowing<em> </em>in advance that he will not have the proper<em>kavanah</em> in <em>Birkat</em> <em>Avot</em>. According to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, even if he already prayed and did not have            <em>kavanah</em> in "<em>Avot</em>," he must repeat the <em>Amidah</em>; all the more so he may not start praying without <em>kavanah</em>.

    <div id="ftn6">

            The <em>Acharonim</em> explain that in practice, even if a person did not have <em>kavanah</em> at all while reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, since he
did intend to fulfill the mitzvah of prayer, he fulfills his obligation. So writes the <em>Shibolei HaLeket</em> 17, in the name of the            <em>Rishonim</em>. Similarly, the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 101:4, in the name of <em>Chesed L'Avraham</em>, writes that concerning one who prays
without <em>kavanah</em>, his <em>berachot</em> are not in vain. This means that what he recited is considered prayer; however, because he lacked            <em>kavanah</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> maintain that it is necessary for him to repeat the <em>Amidah</em>. The proof for this is that one who
            realizes in the middle of the <em>Amidah</em> that he did not have <em>kavanah</em> in the first <em>berachah</em> does not immediately go back.
            This is not true regarding one who realizes that he mistakenly mentioned rain in the summer, for he needs to go back immediately. Based on this, it
            is understandable why today we do not repeat the <em>Amidah</em>. See <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 1, p. 157 and <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 3, 9:3.
Regarding a person who almost always has <em>kavanah</em> but this time did not, and he is certain that when he repeats his prayer he will have            <em>kavanah</em>, he is permitted to go back and repeat the prayer while concentrating. It is best for him to make a stipulation that if he is
exempt from repeating his prayer due to the <em>minhag</em> not to repeat it, his prayer should be considered a voluntary prayer (            <em>tefillat nedavah</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 101:4 writes, in the name of the <em>Chayei Adam</em>, that if he realizes before the conclusion of            <em>Birkat Avot</em>, he must go back and start from "<em>Elokei Avraham.</em>" See <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>V'Ha'idna</em>" where he
            suggests that someone who already finished reciting the first <em>berachah</em> wait for the <em>Amidah</em> repetition so that he can fulfill the
            obligation of the <em>berachah</em> by hearing the <em>chazan</em>. There are those who expressed doubt as to how he is able to fulfill his
            obligation of the first <em>berachah</em> by hearing the <em>chazan</em> and the rest of the <em>Amidah</em> by saying it himself, since the first
            three <em>berachot</em> are considered one unit (as brought in the name of the <em>Chazon Ish</em>). <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 1, p. 157 writes
that he continues praying and tries to have <em>kavanah</em> in <em>Modim</em>, for some say that the essence of <em>kavanah</em> must be either in            <em>Avot</em> or in <em>Modim</em>.

            The <em>Amidah</em> continued to be called "<em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>", since this was its name originally. My teacher and rabbi, Rav Tzvi Yehudah
Kook <em>ztz"l</em>, further explains that the essence of the <em>Amidah</em> is, indeed, the eighteen <em>berachot</em>, for all the            <em>berachot</em> have their own virtue of praise and blessing, but only <em>Birkat HaMinim</em> is about the uprooting of evil, which is
            temporary, since when evil will cease there will be no need for it. Therefore the name of the <em>Amidah</em> remains "<em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>"

            According to the <em>Gra</em>, <em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em> is not recited before <em>Elokai netzor</em>, so that all the prayers of supplication will
            be included in the <em>Amidah</em>, and in his opinion, therefore, we do not respond to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em> there. However,
            according to the <em>Rama</em>, even when it is not customary to recite <em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em> before <em>Elokai netzor</em>, we do, indeed,
            respond to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em> in the prayers of supplication. When we do say <em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em> before the prayers of
supplication, we do not respond to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em> before the verse, although we do answer after it. The<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 122:3 writes that it is good to say <em>Yih'yu l'ratzon</em> before <em>Elokai netzor</em> and after it, and that is the            <em>minhag</em>.

            steps is explained above. Still, <em>Rabbeinu Mano'ach</em> mentions an opinion that maintains that one takes six steps, because each pair of steps
            is considered one step. There are <em>Acharonim</em> who write like him, as cited by the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>V'Shiur.</em>" However,
            the primary opinion is that of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, as brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 24.

            This is what is written in <em>Tefillah Kehilchatah</em> 12:86, in the name of <em>Rav Elyashiv</em>. He adds that even if there is a knock at the
            door which is distracting him so much that he cannot continue praying with <em>kavanah</em>, he is permitted to open the door and hint to the
            person that he cannot talk right now. As for the matter of perusing through a book to determine the halachah, <em>Yalkut Yosef </em>104:5 writes
            that although there are <em>poskim</em> who forbid walking to look something up, he himself agrees that it is permissible, but that asking a rabbi
is forbidden. Nevertheless, it seems that if this law will determine whether or not he fulfills his obligation, it is best that he ask, as the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> states. If possible, it is best that he writes his question down on a piece of paper, instead of interrupting with words.
            If, in the meantime, enough time passed in which he could have recited the entire <em>Amidah</em>, according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 104:5,
            he must start it from the beginning. However, the <em>Rama</em> maintains that he only goes back to the beginning when the interruption is due to
            circumstances beyond his control.

        <p>
            If one arrives at <em>Al HaNisim</em> during Chanukah or Purim and he does not remember the words, he is permitted to walk to get a <em>siddur</em>
in order to recite it, despite the fact that failing to recite it does not prevent him from fulfilling his obligation of reciting the            <em>Amidah</em>. If possible, it is better that he hints to someone to bring him a <em>siddur. </em>It seems that it is forbidden to walk in order
            to verify a law that for certain does not prevent someone from fulfilling his obligation, since the study of the halachah distracts one's thoughts
            from his prayer, and that constitutes more of an interruption. Therefore, as long as it is clear that it is not a matter that prevents him from
            fulfilling his obligation, he may not look it up. So writes the <em>Beit Baruch</em> 25:22.

The <em>Rishonim</em> are divided concerning this. According to <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em> and <em>Ri</em>, it is forbidden to be silent and have            <em>kavanah</em> to hear the <em>chazan</em>, for that is considered an interruption. <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em> and <em>Rashi</em> maintain that
one should remain silent and have <em>kavanah</em> to hear the <em>chazan</em>. So write the <em>Tosafot</em> and <em>Ran</em> that the            <em>minhag</em> is to be quiet and have <em>kavanah</em>, and so rules <em>the</em> <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 104:7. However, if this will disturb
the person's <em>kavanah</em>, he may practice like those who forbid it. That is the law even concerning someone who is in the middle of            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>, as written in <em>Shut Tzitz Eliezer</em> 11:3 and <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 6:12.

            If one has two options, to stand with his feet apart or to sit with his feet together, it is preferable to stand, for the obligation to stand is
            more important. The proof for this is that some <em>poskim</em> maintain that if a person who prayed while sitting has an opportunity afterwards to
            stand, he must repeat the <em>Amidah</em> while standing (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:9), whereas regarding a person who prays with his feet apart,
            no such thing is said. See <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 95:1 and <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, it seems that it is preferable to pray while standing, even if not in the direction of Jerusalem, rather than to pray while sitting
            facing Jerusalem. Again, this is because we have not found an opinion stating that if he recites the <em>Amidah</em> towards a different direction
            he needs to repeat his prayer. Further, in <em>Bava Batra</em> 25 we learn that there are opinions which maintain that a person may pray facing
south or north, and although the halachah is not like them, <em>b'dieved</em>, we can take them into consideration (see <em>Beit Yosef</em> and            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:1-2 and the <em>Rama</em>'s words).

            A soldier who is in the middle of a long hike of endurance, and is worried about finishing, may pray while walking, for if he stops to stand in his
            place, he will not be able to concentrate properly, as explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:4. However, if the case concerns a group of
            religious soldiers, they should stand in their places and pray, for as a group they are not as distracted. Additionally, as it is only training and
            not actual combat, there is no reason <em>l'chatchilah</em> to slight the prayer, and they must arrange their schedules in such a way that the army
            training exercises do not conflict with the times of prayer.

            However, <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 14:16-17 maintains that if he will finish his trip before midnight, he must pray after the trip. Nevertheless, it
            seems that <em>kavanah</em> is more important and therefore one may rely in this case on <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 94:5, who maintains that
            since the time for <em>Shacharit</em>, <em>Minchah</em>, or <em>Ma'ariv </em>has arrived while he is traveling, even if he will finish his trip
            before the final time to recite that prayer, he is permitted to recite the <em>Amidah</em> while sitting, and is not obligated to delay the mitzvah
            in order to pray afterwards while standing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> adds there that if he finishes traveling after <em>chatzot</em>, it is best that he recite the <em>Amidah</em> while
sitting, although there are <em>poskim</em> who disagree. However, regarding the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Ma'ariv</em>, according to many,            <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is permissible to recite the <em>Amidah</em> all night long (see further in this book, 25, note 8). If so, according to
this approach, one can recite <em>Shema</em> before <em>chatzot</em>, and the <em>Amidah</em> after that. If he begins his trip at the time of            <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> (appearance of the stars) and is concerned that after the trip he will forget to recite <em>Ma'ariv</em>, it is better
            that he pray <em>Ma'ariv </em>at <em>plag haminchah </em>while standing and recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> after <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> (ibid.,
            14:18). See earlier in this book 11:7-8, regarding the laws of traveling before <em>Shacharit</em>.<em></em>

            Concerning praying on a bus that is specifically arranged for prayer, there are still a few aspects that render this prayer <em>b'dieved</em>.
            Among them: 1) it is proper to pray in a synagogue, as explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:9. 2) It is proper to pray in a place that is not
            open to the public domain, one in which people cannot look outside, and in which the prayer will not seem to be a burden (ibid., 90:20). 3) When
standing on a bus, it is necessary to lean on something to remain balanced, which is a <em>b'dieved</em> situation, as clarified in            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 94:8 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 22. However, it seems that if the prayer on the bus is conducted in a more composed
            manner, whereas in a synagogue the people would rush to finish their prayer and hurry to get to work on time, it is better that they pray on that
            kind of bus, since it possesses the primary laws of prayer - that there is a <em>minyan</em> and that the people are standing. Even though when the
            bus is moving, those standing in it are considered walking nevertheless the <em>Taz</em> 94:4 writes that concerning the <em>Amidah</em>, the most
            important factor is that they themselves are standing.

The <em>Ohel Mo'ed</em> is stringent, and there are those who do not take his opinion into consideration, as written in <em>Pri Chadash</em>.<em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Yitro</em> 6, writes that the custom is to act leniently, as writes <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 102:2. However, many            <em>Acharonim</em> are stringent, as both the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:9 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 10, write. Even to stand in front of him
within his four <em>amot</em>,<em> l'chatchilah</em> is not proper, so he does not appear to be prostrating himself before him, see<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:8-9. The measure of approximately "within a person's eyesight," concerning the matter of getting up for a            <em>talmid chacham</em>, is defined in the <em>Shach</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah</em> 244:8 as 266 2/3 <em>amot</em> (approximately 128 meters; 419.95
            feet). However, it seems that in any case in which the person reciting the <em>Amidah</em> does not appear to be bowing down to the person in front
            of him, either due to the distance between them or the conditions of the area, there is no need to be stringent.
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:2 writes that if there is a partition with a height of 10 <em>tefachim</em> (80 cm; 31.49 inches) and a width of 4            <em>tefachim</em> (32 cm; 12.59 inches) between the person praying and himself, he may sit. Although a partition cannot be used to allow someone to
            pass by the person praying, since passing by will disturb his <em>kavanah</em>, sitting is nevertheless allowed, since for that, the partition is
            effective. According to the <em>Chayei Adam</em> and <em>Eshel Avraham</em> (<em>Butshatsh</em>), when there is a partition, one is even allowed to
            pass by the person praying. However, it seems that it is proper to be stringent regarding sitting directly in front of the person praying, so that
            he will not appear to be prostrating himself before him.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did not differentiate between the sides of a person and behind him. However, see <em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Darkei Moshe</em> who explain that
            some <em>poskim</em> rule that there is no prohibition against sitting behind a person praying, even within his four <em>amot</em>. Still, in
            practice, the <em>Acharonim</em> agree to forbid sitting behind him, as explained in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:3 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:15 and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>Assur</em>" write that the reason for the prohibition is the disturbance
            it will cause to the person praying. That is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em>, and so writes the <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em>. However,
            the <em>Chayei Adam</em> maintains that the reason for the prohibition is that one who passes in front of a person reciting the <em>Amidah</em>
            interferes with his connection to the<em> Shechinah</em>. There are practical halachic differences (<em>nafka minot</em>) between the reasons. If
            the reason is disruption, then if the person praying covers his eyes with his <em>tallit</em>, one may pass in front of him. However, if the reason
is because of the honor of the <em>Shechinah</em>, one is forbidden to pass. By contrast, if there is a partition with a height of ten            <em>tefachim</em> in front of the person praying, then if the reason is the honor of the <em>Shechinah</em>, the partition is considered a divider
and he may pass. But if it is because of distraction, he is prohibited from passing, as cited by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:2. The            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> writes that it is proper to take into consideration the reason that the <em>Chayei Adam</em> presents as well. Still,
            according to <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em>, both reasons are mutually dependent, and only when there is a distraction to the person praying is
there also an affront to the honor of the <em>Shechinah</em>. (This dispute is not contingent upon the disagreement between the            <em>Magen Avraham</em> and <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, which is brought further in this chapter, because the <em>Magen Avraham</em> 102:6 also mentions
            that the reason for the prohibition is the disruption to the person praying. Furthermore, even according to the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> one could
            explain that the affront to the honor of the <em>Shechinah</em> is only when one passes directly in front of the person praying.)

            The majority of <em>poskim</em>, <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> alike, are of the same opinion as that of the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, as
            explained in the book <em>Four Amot of Prayer</em>, p. 338. This is also the simple meaning of the words in the Talmud, "It is prohibited to pass
            in front of the people praying." Therefore, despite the fact that <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is good to follow the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, in times
of need it is possible to rely on the opinion of the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>. In general, it is possible to explain the opinion of the            <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, that the prohibition to pass is only when it causes a great distraction to a person reciting the<em> Amidah</em>. A great
            distraction is only one in which a person crosses over the four <em>amot</em> in front of the face of the person who is praying, or if the person
            praying in front of him finishes his prayer and steps backwards directly in front of him. According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> 102:6, the
            prohibition also applies when there is even a small distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Magen Avraham</em> 102:5 writes further, in the name of the <em>Zohar</em>, that one should be more stringent, that even on the sides of
            one reciting the<em> Amidah</em> it is prohibited to pass. The reason is that this is considered a holy place, and not just because of the
disturbance it causes. Some <em>Acharonim</em> write that it is correct to be stringent and act according to the <em>Zohar</em>'s opinion, as the<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 102:27 writes, and as is implied from the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 17 (although <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 102:12 explains the            <em>Zohar</em> in a way that agrees with the Talmud).
        </p>
        <p>
            By contrast, the <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> is very lenient regarding this law and maintains that the whole prohibition depends on the extent
            of the disturbance caused to the person reciting the<em> Amidah</em>. Therefore, if his eyes are closed, it is permissible to pass. Likewise, if he
is reciting the prayers of supplication at the end of the <em>Amidah</em>, it is permissible to pass by him (and concerning this ruling the            <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 102:13 agrees, although many <em>poskim</em> disagree with them). The <em>Eshel Avraham</em> writes further, that in
            times of need, it is permitted to pass before the person praying, since perhaps he is reciting the prayers of supplication, and we are lenient
            regarding an uncertainty surrounding a rabbinic obligation. Moreover, he writes that for a mitzvah, it is permissible to pass before the person
            praying.
        </p>
        <p>
In order to complete a <em>minyan</em>, <em>Yad Eliyahu</em> 6 writes that it is permitted to pass in front of a person reciting the<em> Amidah</em>. However, in order to pray with the <em>minyan</em> it is not allowed. <em>Magen Avraham</em> 69:4, cited by the<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 69:9, writes that one may not pass in front of a person praying in order to respond to <em>Barchu</em>.            <em>Eshel Avraham</em> permits passing in order to respond to <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Barchu</em>, and to pray with a <em>minyan</em>. Further,
            the <em>Eshel Avraham</em> writes that in order not to transgress the prohibition of "Do not abominate oneself" (as when one needs to go to the
            restroom), one is allowed to pass in front of a person praying (and it seems that in this matter all <em>poskim</em> are in agreement). Concerning
            their dissension, since it is a rabbinic doubt, although the lenient <em>poskim</em> are but a few, in times of need, it is permissible to rely on
them. Also, <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 7:22 relies on the opinion of the <em>Eshel Avraham</em> in that he permits passing before a person reciting the            <em> Amidah</em> in order to pray with a <em>minyan</em> and to hear <em>Kaddish</em>. He adds another reason, that today the <em>kavanah</em> in
            our prayers is minimal and the person passing does not greatly disturb. However, he forbids passing in order for someone to pray in his regular
            seat. Based on logical reasoning, I wrote that it is permissible to pass by the side of the person praying in order to get to one's permanent place
            of prayer but that it is forbidden to pass by the sides of a few people, because he will certainly disturb one of them, which is also how I have
            seen people practice.

            <a href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18" title="">[18]</a>
            The <em>Eshel Avraham</em> is lenient because perhaps the fact that the person stood there to begin with is because he knows that people passing by
            do not disturb his concentration, and therefore, according to his approach, there is no prohibition to pass by in front of him while he is reciting
            the<em> Amidah</em>. Further, it is the obligation of the person who is causing the damage to distance himself from the person to whom he is
            causing it. The <em>Maharsham</em> in <em>Da'at Torah</em> 102:4 tends to favor the opinion that it is permitted to pass in front of him since he
            resembles a grave that harms the public, regarding which the law permits its removal and negates any further entitlement to that space. That is
            what the <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> writes in 9:8, in their names and in the names of other <em>Acharonim</em>.

A person is considered a divider, as explained in <em>Beit Baruch</em> 26:23, <em>Az Nidberu</em>, part 3, 45; part 6, 47, and            <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 29:9. Regarding a partition ten <em>tefachim</em> high, there are <em>poskim</em> who forbid it, since it is too low and the
person reciting the<em> Amidah</em> is likely to see the person in front of him taking three steps back and become distracted, as implied in the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 102:2. According to the <em>Eshel Avraham</em> 102, even if in front of him there is only a <em>shtender</em> (lectern)
            (which is not a valid partition), the person in front of him is permitted to step backwards or pass in front of the other praying behind him. He
            explains that this prohibition is based on the fact that the person reciting the<em> Amidah</em> behind him will be concerned that perhaps he will
            bump into him, but if there is a <em>shtender</em> between them, there is no such concern. This applies even more so in regard to a valid
            partition. The <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 102:13 writes that a partition can be used. Synagogue benches are sometimes open from the bottom, and if
            there is a space of more than 24 cm (9.45 inches, three <em>tefachim</em>), then they are not considered a divider. However, in general, when a
            person prays the <em>Amidah</em>, he usually puts his seat up, which leaves less than 24 cm between the bottom wooden board and the seat, and
            therefore it is considered to be a partition. Even when the space is larger than 24 cm (9.45 inches) and it is not considered to be a valid
            partition, according to the <em>Eshel Avraham</em>, since the person praying is not concerned that people will bump into him, one is permitted to
            step in front of him. One who wishes to be lenient is permitted to rely on his opinion. Even when the seat is a valid divider, it seems that it is
            not proper to sit directly in front of the person praying, for then the person praying will appear to be prostrating himself before him (as
            explained in halachah 17, note 15, of this chapter).
        </p>

    <div id="ftn20">

            <a href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20" title="">[20]</a>
            According to the <em>Eshel Avraham</em>'s approach, the entire prohibition is because of disturbance. Based on this, if the person praying knows
            that the delay he causes to the person praying before him bothers him more, he can ask him to please step back after he is finished praying and not
            wait for him to finish his prayer. If he steps at an angle in such a way that he does not come close to the person praying behind him, according to
            the <em>Chazon Ish</em> in his explanation of the <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, it is permissible. If possible, it is best that a partition be erected
            there, so that he can step backwards, in accordance with the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>. Nevertheless, if no arrangement was made ahead of
            time between the two people praying, and if the person who is extending his prayer finds it difficult to have <em>kavanah</em> since he is causing
            the person who is praying in front of him to wait, although he is in the middle of reciting the <em>Amidah</em>, he is permitted to hint to him
            that he may step backwards (based on the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 104:1).

            If there are a few people reciting the <em>Amidah</em> behind the <em>chazan</em>, and even if he were to step back diagonally, he would step in
front of a person praying, and the time to start the <em>Amidah</em> repetition has arrived, the <em>Acharonim</em> are divided as to what the            <em>chazan</em> should do. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 102:13 writes that concerning a <em>chazan</em> and a rabbi (for whom the congregation waits
            to finish), it is permissible for them to step in front of a person praying because of the trouble caused to the congregation by making them wait.
            Others say that they should wait until the person finishes. The opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> is that the <em>chazan</em> should start
            the <em>Amidah</em> without taking three steps back so as to avoid troubling the congregation.
