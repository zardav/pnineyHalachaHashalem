    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages instituted the recitation of many blessings immediately upon
        awakening in the morning. The purpose of these blessings is to thank
God for the good that He bestows upon us every day. The Talmud (        <em>Berakhot</em> 60b) teaches that when one wakes up, she thanks God
        and says: "My God, the soul which you have placed within me is pure…
Blessed are You, Lord, Who restores souls to dead bodies" (        <em>Elokai Neshama</em>). When she hears the crow of the rooster,
        announcing the arrival of a new day, she says: "Blessed are You, Lord
        our God, King of the universe, Who gives the rooster understanding to
        distinguish between day and night" (<em>Ha-noten La-sekhvi Vina</em>).
Upon opening her eyes, she recites, "…Who gives sight to the blind" (        <em>Poke’aĥ Ivrim</em>). When she stretches her limbs and sits on her
        bed, after being held captive in the shackles of sleep, she declaims:
        "…Who releases the imprisoned" (<em>Matir Asurim</em>). When she
        dresses, she says: "…Who clothes the naked" (<em>Malbish Arumim</em>).
When one stands on her legs, she recites: "…Who straightens the bent" (        <em>Zokef Kefufim</em>). When placing her feet on the ground, she says:
"…Who spreads the earth upon the waters" (        <em>Roka Ha-aretz al Ha-mayim</em>). When she puts on her shoes, she
says: "…Who has provided me with all my needs" (        <em>She-asa li Kol Tzorki</em>). As she begins to walk, she declaims:
        "…Who prepares a person’s strides" (<em>Ha-mekhin Mitzadei Gaver</em>).
        When she fastens her belt, she says: "…Who girds Israel with strength"
        (<em>Ozer Yisrael Bi-gevura</em>). When she puts on a head covering,
she recites: "…Who crowns Israel with glory" (        <em>Oter Yisrael Be-tifara</em>). When she washes her hands, she
        recites <em>Al Netilat Yadayim</em>. When washing her face, she
        recites: "…Who removes sleep from my eyes" (<em>Ha-ma’avir Sheina</em>
        ).

    <p dir="LTR">
        Life’s routine generally erodes our awareness of all the bounty that
        God showers upon us. As a result of this ingratitude, even the
        blessings that God bestows on one daily fails to delight her, and her
        life becomes dull and empty. In order to emerge from this desolation,
she seeks various pleasures. The Sages instituted        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> so that we will not be ungrateful<em>.</em>
        In these blessings, we thank our Creator for all things, big and small,
        that help us function in this world. By expressing our gratitude, we
        are able to contemplate the world in its richness and fullness. We
        learn that every single element in our lives has godly value, and this
        in turn arouses our desire to add goodness to the world with every new
        day.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women and men alike must recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> in order to
        thank God for all the good that is renewed daily.

            2. <em>She-asani Ki-rtzono</em> – For Having Made Me According to
            His Will
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        The Sages instituted three special <em>berakhot</em> of thanksgiving
        within <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar. </em>They are: "…for not having made me a
        gentile" (<em>She-lo Asani Goy</em>), "…for not having made me a slave"
(<em>She-lo Asani Aved</em>"), and "…For not having made me a woman" (        <em>She-lo Asani Isha</em>). Women recite, "…Who made me according to
        His will" (<em>She-asani Ki-rtzono</em>).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There are two interpretations of this <em>berakha</em>. According to
one interpretation, it is a sort of acceptance of a harsh judgment (        <em>hatzdakat ha-din</em>), of the fact that even though women do not
        have as many <em>mitzvot</em>, they bless God "for having made me
according to his will" out of faith that everything is for the good (        <em>Tur </em>46:4). In contrast, the second interpretation emphasizes
        women’s superiority in this world. In this blessing, the innate
        additional virtue of women is brought to fruition, for women are
        inherently more in tune with God’s will. Therefore, only they can say
        "…Who made me according to His will." The fact that women must fulfill
        less <em>mitzvot</em> than men is because by nature they are more
        refined and therefore require less <em>mitzvot</em> to improve
        themselves. Man was created from dust of the earth, whereas woman was
        created from a more sublime substance, man’s rib. In other words, women
are a manifestation of a more advanced stage of development than men (<em>Siĥot Ha-Ritzya</em>, Bereishit pp. 77-78; Shemot p. 380;        <em>Olat Re’iyah</em> vol. 1, pp. 71-72).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is no coincidence that the simple interpretation shows favor to men
        and the deeper meaning to women. Indeed, at first glance, men have
        greater virtue. The virtue of women can only be recognized by means of
        a more profound analysis. Therefore modesty, a trait which emphasizes
        one’s inner virtue is more significant for women.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
In practice, Ashkenazic women have the custom to recite this<em>berakha </em>in full: "        <em>Barukh Ata Hashem Elokeinu Melekh Ha-olam She-asani ki-rtzono</em>"
        ("Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who made me
according to His will"), whereas Sephardic women recite this<em>berakha</em> without God’s name: "        <em>Barukh She-asani Ki-rtzono</em>" ("Blessed is He Who made me
        according to His will"). Even though SA 46:4 rules that God’s name
        should be uttered in this <em>berakha</em>, most Sephardic women
customarily omitted it for fear of reciting a        <em>berakha le-vatala</em>, as this blessing is not mentioned in the
        Talmud (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>46:41).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
In the <em>berakhot</em> of <em>She-lo Asani Goy </em>and        <em>She-lo Asani Aved</em>, Sephardic women customarily use the
feminine forms of the <em>berakha</em>’s objects: "<em>goya</em>" and "        <em>shifĥa</em>." In contrast, Ashkenazic women customarily to recite
these <em>berakhot</em> as they are said by men, because the words "        <em>goy</em>" and "<em>eved</em>" can include both men and women.

        <a name="_Toc402175185">3. The Order of the Morning Blessings</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As we have learned, the original institution of the Sages was to bless
        and give thanks for each and every act immediately upon enjoying it: as
one wakes up, she thanks God for the soul He placed within her and says<em>Elokai Neshama</em>; as she opens her eyes, she recites,<em>Poke’aĥ Ivrim</em>; as she stretches her limbs, she recites,        <em>Matir Asurim</em>; and so on with all the blessings in that manner.
However, today the custom has changed and we recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> consecutively.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Why did this custom change? It is obviously more appropriate to thank
        God immediately upon enjoying His bounty. In that way, the process of
        awakening attains profound significance, as blessings of thanksgiving
to God accompany each and every stage. Indeed, Rambam rules that all        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> must be recited exactly as mentioned in the
        Talmud, each <em>berakha</em> at its appropriate time. There are some
        Yemenite Jews following this ruling even today.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
However, as noted, the prevailing custom is to recite all        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> at once. The reason for this is that if they
are recited in the process of waking, there is concern that one        <em>berakha </em>or more will be forgotten; however, if they are
        recited consecutively, it is more likely they will all be remembered.
Moreover, we want to enhance the mitzva and recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> in the most respectful manner, that is to
        say, with clean hands and while properly dressed, and therefore we
        delay the recitation of the <em>berakhot</em> until after all the
        preparations for prayer are finished. Furthermore, some people find it
        very difficult to concentrate immediately upon waking up, and only
after they dress and wash their faces are they able to recite<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> with <em>kavana</em> (based on SA 46:2 and        <em>Seder Ha-yom</em>).

            4. <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> for One Who Does Not Derive Pleasure
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There is a dispute among prominent Rishonim about whether one may
        recite one of the <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> from which she does not
        derive direct personal pleasure. For instance, may a blind person
        recite <em>Poke’aĥ Ivrim</em>?
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to Rambam (MT, Laws of Prayer 7:9), only one who derives
        pleasure from something may recite a <em>berakha</em> on it. Therefore,
        one who slept in her clothes does not recite <em>Malbish Arumim</em>,
as she does not get dressed in the morning. A cripple does not recite<em>Ha-mekhin Mitzadei Gaver</em>. A paralytic does not recite        <em>Matir Asurim</em> or <em>Zokef Kefufim</em>. Some people of
        Yemenite descent follow Rambam’s opinion. SA 46:8 considers this
        opinion and rules that these <em>berakhot</em> are recited without
        God’s name.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In contrast, according to the Ge’onim including Rav Natronai Gaon and
        Rav Amram Gaon, one must recite all <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar </em>in
        order, whether or not one enjoys the object of the <em>berakha</em>,
        because they were instituted based on the general pleasures of the
        world. Furthermore, the fact that others derive pleasure from something
        can be indirectly useful for someone who does not directly derive
        pleasure from it. Thus, a paralytic blesses God for all the other
        people who can help her. A blind person recites <em>Poke’aĥ ivrim</em>
        for the fact that others are able to see, show her the way, and tend to
        her needs. This is how Rema rules (46:8).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Likewise, the opinion of Arizal is that every Jew must recite all of
        the <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> to thank God for all the general good
        that He showers on the world. Sephardic practice generally follows
Arizal on matters of prayer, and therefore Sephardim also recite all        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> in order.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
        , <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> should be recited as close as possible to
        the time one wakes from her sleep, for they were essentially
        established to be recited as part of the awakening process. Although we
        customarily recite them later consecutively, it is not proper to delay
        their recitation further.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Whoever did not recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> upon waking must try
        to recite them before the time to pray <em>Shaĥarit</em> lapses, since
        some <em>poskim</em> link the time of their recitation to the time of
        the <em>Shaĥarit</em> prayer. In other words, one should try to say
them within the first four seasonal hours of the day, and        <em>be-di’avad</em> until <em>ĥatzot</em> (midday). However, if one
does not manage to recite them before <em>ĥatzot</em>,        <em>be-di’avad</em> she may recite them the whole day. The reason for
this is that according to most <em>poskim</em>, the time to say<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> differs from the time to recite        <em>Shaĥarit</em>, because <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> are blessings of
        thanks for the good things from which people derive pleasure throughout
        the day (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 9 n. 3).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
A woman who recited <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em> and prayed the<em>Amida</em> and then realized that she forgot to recite<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> must make up all the missed<em>berakhot</em> with the exception of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>and<em>Elokai Neshama</em>. This is because according to many        <em>poskim</em>, even without intending to do so, she fulfilled her
        obligation of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> with <em>Ahavat Olam</em>
before <em>Shema</em> and fulfilled her obligation of<em>Elokai Neshama </em>with <em>Meĥayei Ha-metim</em> in the<em>Amida</em> (SA 47:7; MB 59:9; see below 7:5, and        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 9 n. 2).

        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As noted, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, all the blessings should be recited as
        close as possible to the time one wakes up, and it is not necessary to
        say them specifically after dawn. Therefore, one who arises before dawn
in order to work or learn, or for any other purpose, must recite<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> immediately upon waking up. However,        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> may not be recited before <em>ĥatzot</em>.
        Therefore, one who wakes up before <em>ĥatzot</em> must wait until
after <em>ĥatzot</em>, and once she relieves herself, she recites<em>Al Netilat Yadayim </em>as well as the remaining        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>. If she recites them before <em>ĥatzot</em>,
        she does not fulfill her obligation (the time of <em>ĥatzot</em>, or
        midnight, fluctuates depending on location and season; most locales
have calendars specifying the relevant times; MB 47:31,        <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>29; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 9 n. 4;
        above 5:4.)
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        One who wakes up after <em>ĥatzot</em> for a few hours with the
intention to go back to sleep until morning should say        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> after her main waking. If her main waking is
        the one in the middle of the night, and her sleep after that before
morning is like a nap for her, then it is then best that she recites        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> after her initial waking. However, if her
main waking is in the morning, she must recite        <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> after the second rising.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
As a general rule, even one who stayed up all night recites<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>. As we learned (section 4 above), these        <em>berakhot</em> were instituted on the basis of general enjoyment,
        and therefore, even if one does not personally derive pleasure from
        something, she still recites a <em>berakha</em> on it. However, there
        are differing customs regarding the number of <em>berakhot </em>
        recited.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        With regard to <em>netilat yadayim</em>, according to Sephardic custom
        one does not recite a <em>berakha</em> (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>4:49).
According to the Ashkenazic custom, if one is getting ready to pray the        <em>Amida</em>, it is best that before praying, she goes to the
        bathroom and touches a part of the body which is normally covered,
        thereby necessitating <em>netilat yadayim </em>with a <em>berakha</em>
        (MB 4:30; see above, 5:5).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
There is a dispute about whether or not one must repeat        <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah </em>with the dawn of a new day. Therefore, it is
        best that the woman praying recites <em>Ahavat Olam</em>, which in
        addition to being one of the <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, can take
        the place of <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. One who does so must take care
        to recite the <em>Shema</em> following the <em>berakha</em> in order to
        learn Torah after its recitation.

Likewise, there is doubt concerning <em>Elokai Neshama</em> and        <em>Ha-ma’avir Sheina</em>, since some say that only one who has slept
        may recite them. In order to avoid uncertainty, it is best to hear
        these <em>berakhot</em> being recited by someone who has slept with
        intent to fulfill her obligation. If there is no one around to recite
them, according to Sephardic practice and some Ashkenazic<em>poskim</em>, she may recite them herself (        <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 9:6 and n. 6; however, those who

            The straightforward meaning of <em>Tur</em> and SA 46:4 indicates
            that women are obligated to recite <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>,
            which is what MB 70:2 and AHS 70:1 state explicitly. However, MB
            cites the opinion of Rashba and <em>Derekh Ha-ĥayim</em> (cited in
MB 52:10 and BHL <em>ad loc.</em>) that since the time for reciting            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> is limited to the first four seasonal
hours, like the time allotted for the <em>Amida </em>of            <em>Shaĥarit</em>, their recitation is time-bound, and women are
            exempt. Nevertheless, MB concludes, according to the custom
            outlined by Rema in 17:2, women may extend the obligation to
            themselves and recite the blessings.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
In practice, it is clear that women are required to recite            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, and that is even the Sephardic
            practice. There are several reasons for this, each of which is
            sufficient to determine the <em>halakha</em>. First the halakhic
            ruling is that the time of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar </em>lasts the
entire day (as clarified below in section 5 and stated in            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 4:4). Second, these are blessings of
            thanksgiving, in which women are obligated just as men, for it is
            forbidden for any person to derive pleasure from this world without
reciting a blessing (<em>Berakhot</em> 35a).            <em>Responsa Maĥazeh</em> <em>Eliyahu</em> §13, based on the
            rationale of <em>Turei Even</em> and <em>Ĥokhmat Shlomo</em>,
            maintains that <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> are not considered
time-bound <em>mitzvot</em> even according to            <em>Derekh Ha-ĥayim</em>, yet the reality that we wake up in the
            morning dictates that they be recited at that time, immediately
            when we begin to derive that pleasure. (<em>Or Le-Tziyon </em>2:4:1
            states that women are indeed exempt from <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>
            because they are time-bound; however, it is good that women recite
            them since they are <em>berakhot</em> of praise and thanksgiving.
            According to the reasons we have just outlined, women are in fact
            obligated.) Also, as we have already seen above (2:4-5), it is
            possible <em>be-di’avad</em> to fulfill the obligation of prayer
            with <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            There are two <em>berakhot</em> that were instituted in keeping
            with the men’s behavior, but since they include general praise for
            Israel, women are also required to recite them, as we will see
            below in section 4. The first is <em>Ozer Yisrael Bi-gevura</em>,
            which was instituted upon the girding of a belt used to separate
            between one’s heart and one’s nakedness (Rema 46:1), a law that
pertains to men, as explained below (10:7). The second is            <em>Oter Yisrael Be-tifara</em>, instituted for men’s head-covering
            (MB 46:9), as explained below, 10:5-6.

            The <em>berakha</em> of <em>She-asah li Kol Tzorki</em> was
            instituted with regard to footwear. According to the custom of
            Ashkenazim and some Sephardim, we recite this blessing on Yom
            Kippur and Tisha Be-Av, days on which wearing shoes is forbidden,
            to give thanks for the general pleasure of shoes and for the
            ability to wear non-leather shoes on those days. Still, the custom
            of most Sephardim is not to recite <em>She-asah li Kol Tzorki</em>
            on Tisha Be-Av and Yom Kippur (<em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>,
            ch. 9 n. 1).

That is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em> and this is the            <em>halakha</em>. However, one who wishes to study further will
            note in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 9 n. 5 that according
to the kabbalists it is preferable to recite            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> after the first waking. Someone who is
            afraid that she might forget to recite the blessings after the
            second rising, despite the fact that this is her main waking, may
            rely on the <em>poskim</em> who permit her to recite the blessings
            after the first time she wakes up. However, as a general rule, when
there is disagreement among <em>poskim</em> who rule according to<em>halakha</em> and the kabbalists, practice follows the            <em>poskim</em>, except for individuals who follow the Kabbala in
            all aspects of their lives.

For men there is uncertainty whether the recitation of<em>Shema</em> is considered Torah study or not, as explained in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 10 n. 2. However, concerning
            women, since they are not obligated to recite <em>Shema</em>,
            clearly its recitation is considered Torah study, as explained in
MB 47:17. According to many <em>poskim</em>, men must recite            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> with the dawn of a new day, and that is
the practice of Sephardim and some Ashkenazim, as clarified in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 10:7. However, a woman, in any
            case of uncertainty, should be lenient and refrain from reciting
the <em>berakhot</em> (<em>Birkei Yosef</em>;            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>47:34). One reason for this is that in the
            opinion of many <em>poskim</em>, men have a biblical obligation to
            recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, and therefore in cases of
uncertainty they must act stringently and recite the            <em>berakhot</em>, whereas women are not biblically commanded to
            recite <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Hence, the correct ruling is that
in any case of uncertainty, a woman must recite            <em>Ahavat Olam</em> (<em>Ahava Rabba</em> in the Ashkenazic
liturgy) and with that she will have fulfilled her obligation of            <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>, as explained in SA 47:7. Even a woman
            who is not accustomed to reciting <em>Ahavat Olam</em> every day
            can still fulfill her obligation by reciting it. This is explained
            below, 7:5 (see also above, ch. 2 n. 10.)
