Chapter Five: <em>Bitul</em> and <em>Bi'ur</em> <em>Hametz</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. <em>Bitul Hametz</em> in the Evening and Morning
</h2>
<p>
    As we learned (above 3:4), one fulfills the mitzva of <em>bi'ur hametz</em> (disposing of <em>hametz</em>)<em> </em>in two ways, in action and in thought.
    The process of <em>bi'ur hametz</em> involves four stages. The first two, <em>bedika </em>and the first <em>bitul</em>, are performed on the evening of the
    fourteenth of Nisan. The second two stages, <em>bi'ur </em>and the second <em>bitul</em>, take place the following morning. Having discussed the laws
    relating to <em>bedikat</em> <em>hametz</em> in the previous chapter, we shall now address <em>bitul hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    After <em>bedikat</em> <em>hametz</em>, we immediately rid ourselves of the <em>hametz</em> by nullifying it mentally. To make this process easier, a
    formal declaration of nullification - <em>bitul hametz</em> - was composed. This declaration is in Aramaic, because, at the time of its formulation, most
    Jews understood only Aramaic. It reads (according to the Ashkenazic rite):
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
    כל חמירא וחמיעא דאיכא ברשותי, דלא חזיתיה ודלא בערתיה, לבטיל ולהוי הפקר כעפרא דארעא.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Kol hamira ve-hami'a de-ika bi-rshuti, de-lo hazitei u-delo bi'artei, li-vtil u-lehavi hefker ke-afra de-ar'a.</em>
</p>
<p>
    This declaration can also be said in Hebrew:
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
    כל חמץ ושאור שיש ברשותי, שלא ראיתיו ושלא ביערתיו, יבטל ויהא הפקר כעפר הארץ.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Kol hametz u-se'or she-yesh bi-rshuti, she-lo re'itiv ve-shelo bi'artiv, yivatel ve-yehei hefker ke-afar ha-aretz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In English:
</p>
<p>
    All <em>hametz</em> and leaven in my possession that I have not seen and have not eliminated shall be nullified and become ownerless, like the dust of the
    earth.
</p>
<p>
The Sephardic version mentions only <em>hametz</em>, which includes leaven, and only nullification, which includes renunciation of ownership (see    <em>Hazon Ovadia</em>, p. 32).
</p>
<p>
    Following the actual <em>bi'ur hametz</em> on the morning of the fourteenth (see below, part 3 of this chapter), we perform a second <em>bitul hametz</em>.
    This is because the evening <em>bitul hametz</em> applies only to <em>hametz</em> we did not find in our search, and of which we remain unaware. It cannot,
    however, apply to the <em>hametz</em> we still intend to eat, since such <em>hametz</em> is important to us. We likewise cannot nullify the <em>hametz</em>
    we found in our search, because we intend to dispose of this by burning. Moreover, applying our evening <em>bitul hametz</em> to the <em>hametz</em> we
    still plan to eat would reveal the insincerity of our <em>bitul</em> and render it ineffective.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, in the evening we nullify only the <em>hametz</em> we did not find in our search; we do not intend to include the <em>hametz</em> we set aside
to be eaten or burned. The problem is that if we misplace or overlook some of this remaining <em>hametz</em>, we are liable to violate the law of    <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>. To prevent this from happening, we nullify the <em>hametz</em> a second time. One must be careful to
    nullify the <em>hametz</em> by the end of the fifth seasonal hour of the day, for with the onset of the sixth seasonal hour it is forbidden to derive any
    benefit from <em>hametz</em>, and it can no longer be nullified (SA 434:2).
</p>
<p>
    The wording of the morning nullification is slightly different from that of the evening. In the evening we nullify only the <em>hametz</em> that was not
    found during the search, while in the morning we nullify the <em>hametz</em> in its entirety. It reads:
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
כל חמירא וחמיעא דאיכא ברשותי, דחזיתיה ודלא חזיתיה, דבערתיה ודלא בערתיה, לבטיל ולהוי הפקר כעפרא דארעא.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Kol hamira ve-hami'a de-ika bi-rshuti, de-hazitei u-delo hazitei, de-bi'artei u-delo bi'artei, li-vtil u-lehavi hefker ke-afra de-ar'a.</em>
</p>
<p>
    This declaration can also be said in Hebrew:
</p>
<p dir="RTL">
    כל חמץ ושאור שיש ברשותי, שראיתיו ושלא ראיתיו, שביערתיו ושלא ביערתיו, יבטל ויהא הפקר כעפר הארץ.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Kol hametz u-se'or she-yesh bi-rshuti, she-re'itiv ve-shelo re'itiv, she-bi'artiv ve-shelo bi'artiv, yivatel ve-yehei hefker ke-afar ha-aretz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Or in English:
</p>
<p>
    All <em>hametz</em> and leaven in my possession that I have seen and that I have not seen, that I have destroyed and that I have not destroyed, shall be
    nullified and become ownerless, like the dust of the earth.
</p>

2. The Significance of <em>Bitul Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
    As noted, the wording of our <em>bitul hametz</em> is in Aramaic because it was composed in an era when this was the vernacular. Yet one is free to recite
it in Hebrew or any language he understands. If one utters the declaration in Aramaic without understanding its general significance as an act of    <em>bitul</em>, thinking instead that it is an Erev Pesah prayer, he has not nullified his <em>hametz</em> (MB 434:9).
</p>
<p>
The Rishonim explain the significance of the <em>bitul</em> (nullification) in two ways. Rashi and Ramban explain that man has the power to nullify    <em>hametz</em>. This capacity is unique to the context of <em>hametz</em>, since according to the Torah <em>hametz</em> is entirely insignificant during
Pesah. It is forbidden to derive benefit from it, and consequently it is like the dust of the earth, lacking all importance. In one respect alone does    <em>hametz</em> retain significance during Pesah: if it remains in one's house, he transgresses the law of <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
However, if one nullifies his <em>hametz</em> before it becomes forbidden, he has fulfilled the intention of the Torah, and if such a person keeps    <em>hametz</em> in his possession during Pesah, he will not have violated <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Tosafot</em>
explain that the <em>bitul</em> is effective because it renders the <em>hametz</em> ownerless (<em>hefker</em>), and the Sages teach that    <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em> apply only to <em>hametz</em> one owns, not to ownerless <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, according to the first explanation, the nullification focuses on the <em>hametz </em>itself, while according to the second explanation, the
    nullification is directed at the owner, who relinquishes his ownership over the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The Ashkenazic version of the declaration takes both explanations into account, and therefore mentions both nullification and renunciation of ownership.
    The Sephardic version mentions only nullification, which includes renunciation, for if something is nullified it consequently becomes ownerless.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. Laws Regarding <em>Bitul Hametz</em>
</h2>
<p>
    Most Rishonim agree that, in principle, it is not necessary to recite the <em>bitul hametz </em>aloud. It is possible to nullify the <em>hametz</em> "in
one's heart," i.e., to mentally regard his <em>hametz</em> as null and consider it as the dust of the earth. Preferably, however, one should express the    <em>bitul</em> verbally, because this makes it clear and explicit. Moreover, some Rishonim maintain that the <em>bitul</em> must indeed be pronounced aloud
    (see SAH 434:7). All <em>poskim</em> agree that it is not necessary to pronounce the <em>bitul</em> in the presence of others. Nonetheless, some people
    enhance the mitzva by reciting the <em>bitul</em> in the presence of their family, to remind them that there is such a mitzva.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>bitul</em> must be sincere. One must agree in his mind that the <em>hametz</em> is null and void forever, and that he will not use it even after
Pesah. If one intends to use the <em>hametz</em> after Pesah, the <em>bitul</em> is not effective, and he violates <em>bal yera'eh </em>and    <em>bal yimatzei</em>. Likewise, even if one renounces ownership of his <em>hametz</em> and places it in a completely open domain, he must not intend to
    reclaim it after Pesah, for if he does, his <em>bitul</em> is not wholehearted (MB 445:18).
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above (3:4), according to the Torah, one can dispose of his <em>hametz</em> by merely nullifying it, and even if one were to keep    <em>hametz</em> of great value in his possession, he may nullify it and would not transgress <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei </em>as long as he
    makes a firm mental commitment that the <em>bitul</em> is absolute and that he will never again derive benefit from the <em>hametz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    However, the Sages ordained that we not rely upon the <em>bitul</em> alone. Rather, one must also physically remove the <em>hametz</em> from his
possession. They did this because they feared that the <em>bitul</em> might not be performed wholeheartedly. However, if one forgets to eliminate his    <em>hametz</em>, and when Erev Pesah arrives he is far from his home, he may rely on the <em>bitul</em> alone - but as soon as he returns home he must
destroy the <em>hametz</em>. Even if he returns after Pesah, he must remove the <em>hametz</em>, for if he fails to remove it, he proves that his    <em>bitul</em> was not wholehearted (SA 448:5; MB<em> ad loc.</em> 25).
</p>
<p>
    In principle, it is possible to nullify <em>hametz</em> through a <em>shali'ah</em>s<em>.</em> However, preferably the owner of the <em>hametz</em> should
perform the <em>bitul </em>himself, because some authorities maintain that only the owner of the <em>hametz</em> has the power to nullify his    <em>hametz</em> (SA 434:4; MB<em> ad loc.</em> 15).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. The Custom of <em>Bi'ur Hametz</em> by Burning
</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, in addition to <em>bitul hametz</em>, the Sages ordained the active elimination of all <em>hametz</em> remaining after breakfast on the
    morning of the fourteenth, and any <em>hametz</em> that was found during <em>bedikat hametz</em> (including the ten pieces of bread that were hidden before
    the search). In principle, one may eliminate the <em>hametz</em> in various ways: by crumbling it and throwing it into the wind, the sea, or a river (SA
    445:1); by pouring bleach or some other substance on it, rendering it unfit to be eaten by a dog, since if it is not considered <em>hametz </em>food, it
    need not be eliminated (SA 442:9); by placing it in an ownerless public domain before it becomes forbidden (MB 445:18); or by flushing it down the toilet,
    whereby it no longer remains in the house.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, the holy people of Israel customarily enhance the mitzva of eliminating the <em>hametz</em> via burning it. Nothing eliminates <em>hametz</em>
    better than fire. Furthermore, there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that the mitzva to dispose of <em>hametz</em> must be fulfilled by burning.
</p>
<p>
Those who wish to enhance this mitzva further must make sure to nullify the <em>hametz</em> after burning it, since if they nullify it beforehand, the    <em>hametz</em> will no longer be considered theirs, and they will lose the enhancement of <em>bi'ur</em> by burning. One must therefore be careful to
    leave enough time after burning the <em>hametz</em> to nullify it, for after the fifth hour of the day it is no longer possible to nullify <em>hametz</em>
    (as we learned above 3:6). Hence, as soon as a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>hametz</em> has been burned, the enhancement of <em>bi'ur</em> <em>hametz</em> by
    burning has been achieved, and the <em>bitul</em> can be recited.
</p>
<p>
    Some people, when using kerosene to light the fire, are careful not to pour it directly on the <em>hametz</em>. They do this so that the fire alone
    destroys the <em>hametz</em>, and the kerosene does not render it unfit for consumption by a dog before it is burned.

5. <em>Hametz</em> in the Garbage
</h2>
<p>
    On the morning of the fourteenth of Nisan the question arises: Must <em>hametz</em> that has been placed in the garbage also be destroyed?
</p>
<p>
    If the garbage bin belongs to a Jew or is located on his property, he is obligated by rabbinical ordinance to remove the <em>hametz</em> before it becomes
    prohibited. The owner may pour bleach or some other foul substance on the <em>hametz</em> rendering it unfit for consumption by a dog.
</p>
<p>
    If the garbage container is the property of the local authority and is located in the public domain, one need not destroy the <em>hametz</em> he placed in
it before the <em>hametz</em> becomes prohibited. The local authority is not obligated to destroy it because it was not interested in acquiring the    <em>hametz</em> to begin with. Its only aim was to remove it to a garbage dump.

</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. <em>Hametz</em> Found after the Onset of the Prohibition
</h2>
<p>
    If one finds <em>hametz</em> in his possession after the sixth hour of the day, he must dispose of it immediately. After midday, if one forgot to nullify
    the <em>hametz</em> in his possession, he is obligated by Torah law to eliminate it. The most preferable form of the mitzva is to burn the <em>hametz</em>,
    but one may eliminate it in a number of ways, as we have learned. For example, one may crumble the <em>hametz</em> and cast it into the wind, or break up
    the <em>hametz</em> and flush it down the toilet.
</p>
<p>
However, if one throws his <em>hametz</em> into an ownerless public domain, he has accomplished nothing. Although one may renounce ownership of his    <em>hametz</em> before it becomes prohibited and thus avoid the obligation to remove it, if one still possesses <em>hametz</em> when the prohibition takes
    effect, the only way he can get rid of it is by destroying it completely.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, once the prohibition has taken effect, it is no longer possible to remove <em>hametz</em> simply by pouring a foul substance like bleach on it
    to make it unfit to be eaten by a dog. Only before the <em>hametz</em> becomes prohibited is it possible to do so. If the <em>hametz</em> was fit for
    consumption when the prohibition took effect, one is obligated to dispose of it completely. Therefore, if one finds such <em>hametz</em> in his possession,
    he must burn it, scatter it in the wind, or crumble it into pieces and flush it down the toilet, in order to eliminate it. As stated, the best way to
    fulfill this mitzva is by burning the <em>hametz</em>. Moreover, even after the <em>hametz</em> has been burned, it is forbidden to derive benefit from its
    ashes.
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    If one finds <em>hametz</em> on the first or last day(s) of Pesah or on Shabbat of <em>Hol Ha-mo'ed</em>, he may not burn it or even carry it to the
    bathroom to flush it down the toilet, as <em>hametz </em>is <em>muktzeh </em>and may not be handled. Rather, one must cover it with a container so that
nobody accidentally eats it, and it must be burned as soon as possible after the Shabbat or holiday. If the same person forgot to nullify his    <em>hametz</em> before Pesah, he violates two Torah prohibitions - <em>bal yera'eh </em>and <em>bal yimatzei</em> - every moment the <em>hametz</em>
remains in his possession. In order for one to spare himself from these transgressions, according to many <em>poskim</em> he may pick up the    <em>hametz</em>, break it up somewhat, and throw it into the toilet; these <em>poskim </em>permit violating the laws of <em>muktzeh</em>, which are of
    rabbinic origin, in order to avoid Torah prohibitions. Nonetheless, some <em>poskim</em> take the stringent position that he should wait until Shabbat is
    over before getting rid of the <em>hametz</em> (MB 446:6).
</p>
<p>
Regarding the <em>berakha</em>, if one finds <em>hametz</em> during Pesah, even though it is a mitzva to dispose of it, he does not recite a    <em>berakha</em> before the <em>bi'ur</em>, because the blessing he said before <em>bedikat hametz</em> included all <em>hametz</em> in his possession that
required removal. However, if one kneads dough during Pesah and it becomes <em>hametz</em>, he must say the <em>berakha</em> over its disposal since this    <em>hametz</em> was not in his possession before Pesah, at the time of his <em>bedika</em>, and thus the <em>berakha</em> he said then did not apply to it
    (MB 435:5).

. <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> (6:4) which cites <em>Tur</em> 436, Ramban<em>, </em>Ran<em>, </em>and<em> </em>Maharam Halawa that            <em>bitul</em> in one's mind is sufficient. SAH (434:7 and <em>Kuntrus Aharon</em>) explains that even though these authorities believe that
            nonverbal nullification suffices on a Torah level, they still maintain that on a rabbinic level preferably one should nullify the <em>hametz</em>
verbally. According to Ritva and <em>Beit Yosef</em>,<em> </em>based on the Yerushalmi, one must verbalize the <em>bitul</em>. However, SA            <em> </em>437:2 states: "He nullifies it in his heart and this is sufficient." BHL<em> </em>437:2 states that there are two opinions in the matter,
and Gra agreed that nullification in one's mind is sufficient. Whatever one nullifies to himself is considered <em>hefker</em>, as per            <em>Tosafot</em>'s explanation that the purpose of the nullification of <em>hametz</em> is to deem it ownerless. Even though generally if one wants
            to declare his property ownerless he must do so in front of three others, as per rabbinic injunction, in this case the Sages deferred to the Torah
            standards of <em>hefker</em> and allowed one to make the declaration to himself.

            . See <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 6, n. 7, which cites <em>Responsa </em><em>R. Akiva Eger</em> that if one verbalized the declaration to make
his <em>hametz</em> ownerless, it becomes ownerless, even if he did not make the declaration wholeheartedly. Thus, anyone can claim his            <em>hametz</em>, and the former owner is not able to claim that he did not mean what he said. Perhaps, according to MB in the name of SAH, although
legally another individual can acquire the <em>hametz</em>, if the original owner did not nullify his <em>hametz</em> wholeheartedly, the            <em>hametz</em> remains in his possession until someone else actually claims it (as opposed to becoming ownerless right away).

            . There is a dispute in <em>Pesahim</em> 27b regarding the mitzva of destroying the <em>hametz</em>: R. Yehuda says it must specifically be burned,
and the Sages say it can be destroyed in any fashion. According to the majority of Rishonim, including Rambam<em>, </em>Rosh, Ritva, and Ran, the<em>halakha</em> follows the Sages; this is also the ruling of SA<em> </em>445:1. A minority of authorities, including <em>Tosafot</em> and            <em>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</em>, follows R. Yehuda. <em>Bah </em>and Gra add that even the Sages believe that the preferred method is burning, just
            that it is also possible to destroy the <em>hametz</em> in other ways. Other Aharonim disagree and feel that according to the Sages there is
            nothing special or preferable about burning, and one may destroy his <em>hametz</em> in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most Rishonim<em> </em>feel that even according to R. Yehuda, the mitzva<em> </em>to burn <em>hametz</em> only applies to <em>hametz</em> that is
            left over past midday of the fourteenth, when it becomes forbidden, similar to the law of <em>notar</em> (uneaten portions of a sacrifice left over
            until the morning), which must also be burned. However, before midday of the fourteenth, it is possible that even R. Yehuda would agree that one
            may destroy the <em>hametz</em> any way he wants; this is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam and Maharam Halawa. On the other hand, Rashi explains that
according to R. Yehuda the mitzva is to burn the <em>hametz</em> before midday. According to Rosh<em>'s</em> understanding of Rashi, the mitzva<em> </em>to burn the<em> hametz</em> only applies during the sixth hour of the day, but according to <em>Tur'</em>s understanding of Rashi            <em>, </em>the mitzva<em> </em>to burn the <em>hametz</em> applies even prior to the sixth hour. If this opinion is correct, the mitzva<em> </em>to
            destroy the <em>hametz</em> is specifically by burning it. See <em>Birur Halakha Pesahim</em> 27b for a summary of the topic. Even though it is
            clear according to almost all <em>poskim</em> that there is no mitzva to burn the <em>hametz</em> before it becomes forbidden, Rema 434:2 and 445:1
            writes that the custom is to burn the <em>hametz</em> even earlier. See <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 2:33, which explains that the stringency of burning
            the <em>hametz</em> is dependent upon the combination of several opinions: firstly, the authorities who follow R. Yehuda; secondly, <em>Tur</em>'s
            understanding of Rashi<em> </em>that the mitzva to burn the <em>hametz</em> applies even before the <em>hametz</em><em> </em>becomes forbidden; and
            thirdly, <em>Tosafot</em>'s opinion that the act of nullification renders the <em>hametz</em> ownerless, as opposed to Rashi<em>'s </em>
            understanding that nullification accomplishes the mitzva of destroying the <em>hametz</em> (and thus the only way to fulfill the mitzva of
destroying the <em>hametz</em> according to <em>Tosafot</em> is by burning it). See also <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 7:5-7 and            <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 8:7-8.

It is also worth noting that, according to a simple reading, the mitzva of removing <em>hametz </em>(in Shemot 12:15) is to dispose of the            <em>hametz</em> before it becomes forbidden, as most Rishonim write. Ran<em> </em>and Ritva<em> </em>also write that one fulfills this mitzva by
conducting <em>bedikat hametz</em>. Rambam writes that the mitzva of removing <em>hametz </em>begins on the night of the fourteenth (MT, Laws of<em>Hametz </em>and Matza<em> </em>3:1). However, Rosh maintains that the mitzva only begins once the <em>hametz</em> becomes forbidden.            <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag </em>8:8 summarizes this topic.

            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em>
            15:4 states that one should be careful not to pour lighter fluid on the <em>hametz</em> itself, and see <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 8:10 n. 17,
            which disagrees, since the main objective is to turn the <em>hametz</em> into ashes, regardless of whether or not its taste remains intact. See
            above ch. 3 n. 8.

            . <em>Igrot Moshe</em> OH <em> </em>3:57 states that the mere act of placing the <em>hametz</em> in the trash clearly shows that one's intentions
            were to rid himself of the <em>hametz</em>. However, if the trash can belongs to him, according to <em>Taz</em> and MA 445:3 he has a rabbinic
            obligation to burn the <em>hametz</em>. However, if the trash can is in the public domain, he does not have to burn any <em>hametz</em> he placed
            inside the trash can. <em>Bedikat</em><em> Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 3:45 adds that if the <em>hametz</em> is so filthy that clearly no person would use
            it for any purpose, it is considered destroyed. It also adds a novel idea in n. 130: <em>hametz</em> that is unfit for humans but suitable for dogs
            only must be destroyed if the <em>hametz</em> is able to cause other dough to become <em>hametz. </em>However, if the <em>hametz</em> is so filthy
that it is no longer suitable to any person for any purpose, it is considered nullified and need not be destroyed (see also<em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 445:7, which cites other opinions). Nevertheless, when one discards his trash into a bag, as is the modern custom, the            <em>hametz</em> does not always become that dirty. Thus, if the trash can is in his domain, it is best to dispel all doubt and refrain from
            discarding <em>hametz</em> that is still suitable for dogs into that particular trash can in the days leading up to Pesah.

            . See n. 3, where we learned that the main dispute between R. Yehuda and the Sages is about <em>hametz</em> that one finds after it has already
become forbidden. According to the Rishonim who follow R. Yehuda, one has a mitzva<em> </em>to burn this <em>hametz</em>. Even though most            <em>poskim</em> follow the Sages, as quoted in SA 445:1, burning the <em>hametz</em> is an acceptable method, especially according to R. Yoel
            Sirkis (<em>Bah</em>)<em> </em>and Gra, who maintain that the Sages agree that the preferable method to destroy the <em>hametz</em><em> </em>is
            burning. This is what MB<em> </em>states in 445:6.
        </p>
        <p>
Once the <em>hametz</em> becomes forbidden, there is an obligation to destroy the <em>hametz</em> completely, as cited in SA<em> </em>442:9 and MB            <em> ad loc. </em>40. Even declaring the <em>hametz</em> ownerless does not work at this point; it only works before the <em>hametz</em> becomes
forbidden, as explained in MB 445:18. Even after the <em>hametz</em> is burned, one is forbidden to benefit from the ashes, as explained in SA            <em> </em>445:2. MB<em> </em>445:5 states that if one throws <em>hametz</em> into an outhouse, it is considered destroyed. However, the outhouses
            in the times of MB were exceptionally filthy, and anything that was thrown there became so repulsive that it would no longer be usable in any
            capacity. Conversely, bread that has been discarded in a modern toilet is likely to emerge intact from the drainpipes, and would likely be fit for
a dog; therefore, if one were to discard bread this way, he should first break up the bread into smaller crumbs. See also            <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 7:24 n. 56 for more on this topic, and see 7:1-2 and the corresponding footnotes. In n. 7, the author writes that
if one finds <em>hametz</em> on Pesah and spoils it so that it is no longer fit for a dog, he still violates <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em> according to SAH, but according to <em>Hazon Ish</em> he is required to destroy the <em>hametz</em>, but does not violate            <em>bal yeira'eh </em>or<em> bal yimatzei</em>. According <em>Pri Megadim</em>, he only has a rabbinic obligation to destroy the <em>hametz</em>,
since by not completely destroying the <em>hametz</em> before Pesah he missed the Torah-level mitzva (the opinions of SAH<em> </em>and            <em>Pri Megadim</em> are cited in SHT 442:19).
        </p>
        <p>
Although in general any <em>hametz</em><em> </em>found on Pesah has already been nullified and would therefore only be rabbinically forbidden, the            <em>hametz</em> must still be destroyed, as would any <em>hametz</em><em> </em>that had not been nullified, since, as noted, the rabbis decreed
that all <em>hametz</em> must be nullified and eliminated. SAH (435:4) adds that if one did not burn his <em>hametz</em>, he violates<em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em> on the rabbinic level and is subject to the rabbinic obligation of <em>tashbitu</em>. See also            <em>Bedikat Hametz U-vi'uro</em> 7 n. 40 for other sources. Additionally, see chapter 8, 24, which says that if one finds <em>hametz</em> on Pesah,
            there are ways that he can avoid <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em>, although he cannot fulfill the active mitzva of <em>tashbitu</em>
            . For example, he can heave the <em>hametz</em> into the sea in a manner that the <em>hametz</em> would be impossible to retrieve. The mitzva,
            however, which he cannot fulfill, is to burn the <em>hametz</em><em>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the time for burning the <em>hametz</em>: if one finds <em>hametz</em> in his possession after the beginning of the sixth hour of the
            day, he has a rabbinic obligation to burn it, and if he found <em>hametz</em> that he did not nullify, he has a biblical obligation to destroy it.
            If he does not, he violates <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em> as soon as the festival begins. If he nullified his <em>hametz</em>, he
            does not violate <em>bal yeira'eh </em>and<em> bal yimatzei</em> on the biblical level, but he still has a rabbinic obligation to burn it.
