    : Mental Preparation and Proper Attire

    <a name="_Toc402175218">1. Mental Preparation</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    The Sages teach (<em>Berakhot</em> 31a; SA 93:2), "One should not stand to
    pray while in a state of sadness or ennui." Prayer elevates people.
    Therefore, one must approach prayer out of happiness, knowing that she is
    about to be uplifted and brought closer to God.
</p>
<p>
    The Sages further teach (<em>ibid</em>.), "One should not pray out of
    laughter," because laughter negates one’s reverence for God, and one must
    pray out of a sense of awe and submission. "Nor amidst conversation,"
    because conversation distracts one from her inner world, and prayer is
    supposed to emerge from the depths of one’s soul. "Nor from frivolity and
    idle chatter," because prayer is based on the recognition of one’s ability
    to do great things with her speech, and if she approaches prayer with idle
words, she demonstrates that she does not value her speech (see    <em>Olat Re’iyah</em> vol. 1, p. 29).
</p>
<p>
    In the prayer service for men, the Sages instituted the recitation of
    joyful and heartwarming words prior to reciting the <em>Amida</em> in order
    to settle the mind; before <em>Shaĥarit</em> and <em>Ma’ariv</em>, we
    recite the <em>berakha </em>of<em> </em>"<em>Ga’al Yisrael</em>" ("Who
redeemed Israel"), and before the <em>Minĥa</em> <em>Amida </em>we say    <em>Ashrei</em> (SA 93:2). Although women are not obligated to recite these
    prayers, it is at least incumbent upon every woman to pause for a few
seconds, about the amount of time it takes to walk the distance of four    <em>amot</em>, before praying, in order to settle her mind.
</p>
<p>
    The pious people of yore ("<em>ĥasidim rishonim</em>") would greatly
    augment their preparations for prayer, spending a full hour directing their
    hearts toward their Father in heaven before praying (<em>Berakhot</em> 30b;
    SA 93:1; MB 1).
</p>
<p>
    If a woman plans on giving <em>tzedaka</em>, whether by putting money in
    the <em>tzedaka</em> box in her house or by writing a check for a donation,
    it is best that she does so before praying, so that she enters her prayer
    with the joy of having performed a mitzva (SA<em> </em>92:10).
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    Furthermore, when one beseeches God for kindness and compassion, it is
appropriate that she first give something of hers to the needy. Arizal    <em> </em>recommends reflecting, before prayer, on the mitzva to love your
    fellow as yourself, which is a great Torah principle, as all the prayers
    are formulated in the plural as we pray for the nation as a whole.

    <a name="_Toc402175219">2. Preventing Possible Disruptions in Prayer</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    While reciting the <em>Amida</em>, one may not hold an object that she
    fears will fall, such as a book, bowl, or knife, because her concern that
    it may drop will disrupt her <em>kavana</em> (SA 96:1). However, one may
    hold a <em>siddur</em>, because it is necessary for prayer (<em>ibid. </em>
    1-2). Even while reciting other parts of the prayer service it is good to
    be careful about this. <em>Le-khatĥila</em>, one should not hold anything
    in her hand while reciting the <em>Amida</em>, not even a valueless object,
    about which one is not concerned for it is not respectful to stand in front
    of God while holding something extraneous (see MB 96:1 and 5).
</p>
<p align="left">
    Before praying, one must turn off her cellular phone. In a synagogue or
    where there are <em>siddurim</em> available, one should not use her
    hand-held device as a <em>siddur</em> so that it does not distract her and
    so that she does not appear to be reading messages during prayers. One who
    does not have a <em>siddur</em> available and must therefore use a device
    should first disable the possibility of receiving calls or messages. One
    who must be available for urgent calls may leave the device on, but should
    set it to vibrate, so that its ringing does not disrupt prayer.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
    , one should not recite the <em>Amida </em>with a knapsack on her back, for
    that is not a respectful way to appear before important people, and all the
    more so, it is not respectful to pray in that manner. However, if she is
    already traveling with a knapsack on her shoulders and it is more
    comfortable to leave it on, she may pray with it on her it weighs less than
    four <em>kabin </em>(c. 5.5 kg or 12 lbs, 1.5 oz). If the knapsack is
    heavier than four <em>kabin</em>, she may not pray while wearing it, as it
    is liable to impair her <em>kavana</em> (SA 97:4).
</p>
<p align="left">
    Additionally, if someone holding a wallet full of money or other expensive
    objects fears that if she puts these items down they will be stolen, and
    she does not have pockets in which to put them or a friend there to watch
    them, it is preferable, <em>be-di’avad</em>, to keep them in her hands
while praying, so that she will be less troubled (MB 96:6;    <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>7). Likewise, if someone carrying a heavy knapsack on
    her back is worried that it will be stolen and she has no other choice than
    to carry it, she may pray while wearing it.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A woman may not pray while holding a baby in her arms, because the child
    requires constant attention to make sure he does not fall. Furthermore, the
    baby is likely to disturb her <em>kavana</em>. Even when the baby is
    wrapped inside an infant carrier or sling, it is not respectful to pray
    with him on her. Still, if no other option exists and the woman praying
    knows that she will be able have <em>kavana</em> in her prayer while
    holding the baby, she may pray with him on her. When there is concern that
    she will not be able to have <em>kavana</em>, she may not pray in that
manner; instead, she fulfills her obligation by reciting    <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em>, which may be
    recited even while holding a baby.

    <a name="_Toc402175220">3. Appropriate Attire for Prayer</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    One must prepare herself for prayer, revere God’s majesty and glory, and
    rejoice at the opportunity to stand before the King of kings in prayer.
    This preparation should also be apparent in her dress; one’s clothes should
    be respectable, fitting for one who stands before the King.
</p>
<p align="left">
    The laws of prayer are not like the laws of other matters of sanctity.
Regarding all other matters of sanctity, such as    <em>Birkhot Keri’at Shema</em>, as long as one’s nakedness is covered, they
    may be recited (SA 74:6). However, regarding prayer, since one is standing
    before the King, she must dress in a respectable manner (SA 91:1). With
regard to women, as long as her clothes are modest in accordance with the    <em>halakha</em>, they are indeed valid for prayer.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <em>Le-khatĥila</em>
    one should enhance the mitzva by wearing respectable clothing for prayer,
    so that one honors God at least as much as one honors human beings. Just as
    one is careful to wear dignified attire when meeting important people, so
    too, she must dress at least as respectably for prayer. Indeed, one who
    goes out once in her life to greet a king makes sure to wear her nicest
    clothing. However, one who sees the king every day does not wear her
    fanciest garments; but she does make sure to wear clothes that suit her
    profession and status. Similarly, we come before the King three times a
    day, and we therefore dress nicely for prayer, but save our finest apparel
    for <em>Shabbatot</em>,<em> </em>festivals, and joyous celebrations.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    <a name="_Toc402175221">4. Attire Fit for Prayer</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Although <em>le-khatĥila</em> one must wear respectable clothing for
    prayer, when it is difficult to change one’s clothes, it is permissible to
    pray in everyday clothing, as long as they are not undignified. Therefore,
    a woman who is engaged in household chores and is caring for her children,
    and does not have time to dress for prayer, may pray in her regular clothes
    or a nice robe that she wears around the house. As long as she is not
    embarrassed to open the door to her house in these clothes, they are not
    considered disgraceful.
</p>
<p align="left">
    One should not pray in pajamas (MB 91:11). However, one who is ill may pray
    in pajamas, because it is accepted that one who is not feeling well wears
    pajamas, even when important people come to visit her.
</p>
<p align="left">
    One should not stand in prayer wearing a raincoat, boots, and gloves,
    because that is not the way to stand before important people (MB 91:12).
    Yet, when it is very cold, it is permissible to pray in a raincoat and
    gloves, because this is not an affront to the honor of prayer. Moreover, in
    a place where everyone regularly wears boots, one may wear them while
    praying.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Similarly, girls who are on a field trip are permitted to pray as they are,
    as long as the clothes conform to the laws of <em>tzni’ut</em>. Although
    these clothes would not be considered respectable attire at home, and
    perhaps may even be considered slightly disgraceful, on a trip they are
    acceptable, and even if an important person would appear before them they
    would not feel a need to change their clothes. Therefore, as long as the
    clothes are modest, they may be worn for prayer for the duration of the
    field trip.

    <a name="_Toc402175222">5. Head Covering for Men</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    In order to assess whether women are required to cover their heads when
    praying or reciting <em>berakhot</em>, we must first clarify the law
    regarding men. Originally, a few eminent sages practiced the extra pious
    custom of not walking four <em>amot</em> bareheaded. Rav Huna b. R.
    Yehoshua is praised for not having walked four <em>amot</em> without a head
    covering (<em>Shabbat</em> 118b). He said, "Indeed the <em>Shekhina</em> is
above my head, so how can I go around with it uncovered?" (    <em>Kiddushin</em> 31a). Similarly, the Talmud teaches (<em>Shabbat</em>
    156b) that after it was made known to Rav Naĥman bar Yitzĥak’s mother that
    he would become a thief according to his astrological sign, she was
    extremely meticulous about keeping his head covered constantly, enabling
    him to grow in Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>. Once, when his head covering
    fell, the evil inclination attacked him and his temptation to steal dates
    from the palm tree overtook him. He then understood his mother’s
    strictness. In time, this extra pious act became accepted in all of Israel
    until it became an obligatory custom (SA<em> </em>2:6).
</p>
<p align="left">
    Some<em> poskim</em> say that there is an obligation to cover one’s head
    while mentioning God’s name and reciting <em>berakhot</em>. Others maintain
    that while there is no specific obligation for men to cover their heads
    when mentioning God’s name and reciting <em>berakhot</em>, accepted custom
    requires the covering of one’s head throughout the whole day, including
    when mentioning God’s name. <em>Shulĥan Arukh</em> cites the stringent
    opinion as <em>halakha</em>, according to which one is required to cover
    his head when mentioning God’s name and reciting <em>berakhot</em> (91:3;
    206:3).

<a name="6"></a><h2>
    <a name="_Toc402175223">6. Head Covering for Women</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    Women do not customarily cover their heads in order to arouse fear of
    heaven within themselves. As a matter of <em>tzni’ut</em>,<em> </em>married
    women must cover their hair, but single women, who are not required to
    cover their hair for reasons of <em>tzni’ut</em>, do not normally walk
    around in a head covering like men. Perhaps the reason that women do not
    need a yarmulke is that they naturally find it easier to improve
    themselves. Men are perhaps bolder, and therefore they need yarmulkes on
    their heads to restrain and focus that trait. Women, who by nature are more
    reserved and more modest, have no such need.
</p>
<p align="left">
Another possible explanation is that by observing the laws of    <em>tzni’ut </em>in the way they dress, women more clearly convey
    acceptance of the yoke of heaven upon herself and therefore do not require
    a head covering to express their fear of God. In contrast, even if a woman
    who does not abide by the rules of modesty were to wear a yarmulke, it
would be to no effect, for her transgression of the laws of<em>tzni’ut</em> is very severe; by neglecting to observe the    <em>halakhot</em> which pertain to her, it is as if she is declaring that
    she is not bound by <em>halakha</em>, the word of God.
</p>
<p align="left">
    There are, however, <em>poskim</em> who maintain that single women, too,
must cover their heads when reciting God’s name and saying    <em>berakhot</em>. They maintain that in this matter there is no
    distinction between men and women; rather the command to cover one’s head
    when mentioning God’s name is a separate obligation (<em>Ish Matzli’aĥ</em>
    , <em>Yaskil Avdi</em>). Others say that at the very least, women must
    cover their heads while reciting the <em>Amida</em> (<em>Yabi’a Omer </em>
    6:15). However, in practice, single women are not strict concerning this,
    and even while praying the <em>Amida</em> they do not normally cover their
    heads. The reason for this is that men have adopted the pious custom of
    covering their heads all day in order to inspire their fear of God.
    Therefore, there is ample reason to require them to wear a head covering
    when mentioning God’s name. But for single women, who do not practice this
    custom, a head covering does not demonstrate fear of God, and hence they
    are not obligated to wear one while praying and reciting <em>berakhot</em>.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Nonetheless, married women certainly must cover their hair for prayer,
    since without a hair covering they are not dressed in accordance with the
    laws of <em>tzni’ut</em>; certainly if they were to pray in that manner it
    would be disrespectful. One must come to prayer in distinguished clothing,
    befitting someone who stands before the King of the universe, so certainly
    one must properly observe the <em>halakhot</em> of modest attire.
    Therefore, even women who do not abide by the law and do not normally cover
    their hair should cover it while praying.
</p>
<p align="left">
    When mentioning God’s name, some <em>poskim</em> say that married women
    must be strict about head-covering, even in complete privacy. Others say
    that since single women are not obligated to do so, married women are not
    obligated either. The rationale is that the obligation of married women to
    cover their hair is a function of <em>tzni’ut </em>alone, and since there
is no obligation to dress in a respectable fashion when reciting    <em>berakhot</em>, there is no reason to distinguish between married and
unmarried women, so married women may recite <em>berakhot</em> and    <em>Shema</em> without a hair covering.

    <a name="_Toc402175224">7. Wearing a Belt</a>
</h2>
<p align="left">
    A man may not recite sacred words (<em>devarim she-bikdusha</em>)<em> </em>
    while there is no separation between his heart and his <em>erva</em>
    (nakedness). Thus, one wearing a long cloak or robe without underwear who
    wishes to recite sacred words must wear a belt to divide between his heart
    and his <em>erva</em>. However a woman’s nakedness is lower down, and her
    heart naturally cannot "see" her <em>erva</em>. Hence, a woman may recite
    sacred words while dressed in a robe, even without a separation between her
    heart and her <em>erva</em>.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Prior to the <em>Amida</em>, a man must put on a belt. Some <em>poskim</em>
    maintain that the reason for this is to create a division between one’s
    heart and one’s <em>erva</em>, in which case wearing underwear is
    sufficient and there is no need for a belt. Others say that specifically a
    belt must be worn in honor of the <em>Amida</em>, so as to more effectively
    emphasize the division between one’s heart and one’s <em>erva</em> (SA
    91:2; <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 5:3).
</p>
<p>
    However, women, who are not required to create a division between their
    hearts and their
</p>
<em>erva</em>
<p>
    , do not need to wear a belt when praying.

            The Aĥaronim write, based on Rambam (<em>Ahavat Ĥesed</em> 1:1:14)
that it is better for one who wants to give a large sum of money to            <em>tzedaka </em>to donate money on several occasions instead of
            giving all of it away at once. However, this statement was made in
            a case where the small donation would benefit the starving poor,
            allowing them to buy their next meal with the money received.
            Nowadays, the needs of the poor have changed, there are almost no
            people starving for food, and the existing organizations and soup
            kitchens for the poor people need of large sums of money, it seems
            that there is no virtue in dividing the money into smaller amounts,
            for doing so only burdens fundraisers and undermines the primary
            objective, which is to help the poor. Therefore, instead of 1,000
            people giving small sums of money to 1,000 charity organizations,
it is preferable that each person gives their whole            <em>tzedaka</em> donation to a limited number of places. They
            thereby save the trouble and the tremendous cost entailed in the
            collection of the funds, despite the fact that this may prevent
            them from being able to give <em>tzedaka</em> every day before
            prayer. Nonetheless, people often have small change, and it is
            appropriate to give this as <em>tzedaka</em> before prayer.

            Regarding men there is a question: What does one do if he finds
            himself in a place in which there is nothing but underwear to cover
            his nakedness and he does not have a blanket to cover the rest of
            his body? Some say that since he is in a situation beyond his
            control, he should pray the way he is (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>91:3).
            Others say that he may not pray in this manner (BHL 91:1). This
            issue is clarified in <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, 5:4 n. 6.
            However, it is clear that a woman in the same set of circumstances
            may not pray in that manner, because her lack of clothes is much
            more severe. Furthermore, there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain
that women can fulfill their obligation of prayer by reciting only            <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> and <em>Birkhot Ha-Torah</em>. Yet, if
            she has a blanket, she can, under extenuating circumstances, use it
            to cover her whole body and pray.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worth noting that these laws are more complex for men because
            rules governing their modesty are less strict. Therefore, there are
            men who throughout the day walk around in clothes that are not
            considered respectable, such as shorts and undershirts, but for
prayer they must come in distinguished attire, as explained in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 5:4-5. In contrast, women must
            dress modestly throughout the day, and the modest clothes that they
            wear during the day are certainly valid for prayer.

            Regarding men, a question sometimes arises: Which is preferable,
respectable clothing or praying in a <em>minyan</em>? See            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em> 5:4-5, which states that if the
            clothing is merely "not respectable" it is preferable to pray in
            them with a <em>minyan</em>; however, if they are truly
            disgraceful, it is best to change them and pray individually.
            Additionally, see earlier in this chapter, n. 3, which mentions
            that since for men the limitations of modesty are less strict,
            there are gray areas. For example, a man who is going on a hike may
            wear shorts. However, if it is not accepted for him to wear shorts
            before and after the hike, he must wear long pants for prayer.
            Concerning women, who are bound by rules of <em>tzni’ut</em>, these
            laws are not applicable, because the modest clothing that they wear
            all day is valid for prayer.

            <em>Sofrim</em>
            14:15 states that according to the <em>tanna kama</em> it is
            permissible to mention God’s name bareheaded, whereas others forbid
            it. Rabbeinu Yeruĥam and <em>Or Zaru’a </em>2:43 rule that it is
            forbidden to recite <em>berakhot</em> without a yarmulke, and this
is also the ruling of SA 91:3 and 206:3. However,            <em>Or Zaru’a</em> states that the rabbis of France customarily
            recited <em>berakhot</em> bareheaded. Rambam’s opinion (MT, Laws of
            Prayer<em> </em>5:1 and 5) is that a head covering is necessary for
            the <em>Amida</em>, but when reciting <em>berakhot</em> there is no
            need. <em>Pri Ĥadash</em> 91:3 and Gra 8:6 state that a head
            covering is not technically required for reciting <em>berakhot</em>
, as implied by the Gemara’s explanation of the order of<em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> (<em>Berakhot</em> 60b): all the            <em>berakhot</em> recited before <em>Oter Yisrael</em> are recited
            without a yarmulke. Thus, Rosh, <em>Mikhtam</em>, Rashba, and other
Rishonim, as well as <em>Beit Yosef </em>§46 and            <em>Responsa Maharshal </em>§72, who interpret the Gemara to mean
            that each <em>berakha</em> of <em>Birkhot Ha-shaĥar</em> was said
            immediately upon performing the action, would agree that there is
            technically no requirement to wear a yarmulke to say God’s name.
            However the practice for men is clear: they need a yarmulke for all
            matters of sanctity, as SA rules. It has even become the accepted
custom not to walk four <em>amot</em> without a yarmulke (see            <em>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</em>, ch. 5 n. 3).

            <em>Responsa Ish Matzli’ach</em>
            OĤ<em> </em>24-25, and <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> vol. 7, p. 289 state
that single women must cover their heads when reciting            <em>berakhot</em>. <em>Yabi’a Omer </em>6:15 provides a
            comprehensive summary of the issue and concludes that single women
            should not be prevented from reciting a <em>berakha</em>
            bareheaded; however, it is proper for them to cover their heads
            while praying the<em> Amida</em>, as Rambam says. Married women,
            even when reciting a <em>berakha</em>, must cover their heads, as
            indicated in <em>Ĥesed La-alafim</em> 2:8.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the widespread custom is that single women pray, whether
            at home or in the synagogue, without a head covering. The rationale
            behind Rambam’s ruling that a head covering is necessary when
            praying is that by covering one’s head, one expresses his or her
fear of God, and therefore certainly this is how one must pray the            <em>Amida</em>. Yet, for single women, the yarmulke does not
symbolize fear of God, and hence they may pray bareheaded.            <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> 12:13 reinforces the practice of praying
            pare-headed with the reason offered by Ĥatam Sofer: since gentile
            women customarily cover their heads in their houses of worship,
            Jewish women should be careful not to imitate that custom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, if a married woman, who must cover her hair for
            reasons of <em>tzni’ut</em>, stands in prayer while not dressed in
            keeping with the mandatory<em> </em>parameters of <em>tzni’ut </em>
            in front of others, it certainly constitutes an affront to the
            honor of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reciting <em>berakhot</em> is not considered to be standing before
            the King, so a woman in private, when the laws of <em>tzni’ut </em>
            do not require her to cover her hair, there is no need for her to
cover her head while reciting a <em>berakha</em>. However,            <em>Yabi’a Omer </em>6:15 and <em>Halikhot Bat Yisrael</em> 5:3
            state that married women must cover their heads when mentioning
            God’s name, even when in complete privacy. Still, in practice, many
married women normally recite the bedtime <em>Shema</em> and            <em>Ha-mapil</em> without a head covering. It seems that the reason
            for this is what I wrote above, that the obligation to wear a
            yarmulke when reciting <em>berakhot</em> is based on the pious
            custom to cover one’s head throughout the entire day. Since the
            yarmulke inspires fear of God all day, it follows that one must
            also wear it while invoking God’s name. However, women, who do not
            customarily wear a yarmulke to inspire fear of God, need not wear
one when mentioning God’s name either. There is proof for this in<em>m. Ĥalla</em> 23: "A woman may sit and separate the            <em>ĥalla</em> while nude." Nude here obviously means bareheaded,
            for it would not make sense that she is required to cover her head
            but allowed to recite the <em>berakha </em>while nude. R. Shlomo
            Zalman Auerbach rules this way too, saying that women’s custom to
cover their heads in the <em>mikveh</em> while making the            <em>berakha </em>on immersion does not obligate them in this
practice for all other <em>berakhot</em> (            <em>Halikhot Bat Yisrael</em> 5 n. 6). Therefore, a woman who wakes
            up in the middle of the night to relieve herself is not obligated
            to cover her head while reciting <em>Asher Yatzar</em>. Likewise, a
            woman who walks around her house bareheaded (when there are no
strangers around) and wants to drink something is allowed to recite            <em>She-hakol</em> and <em>Borei Nefashot</em> without a
            head-covering.
