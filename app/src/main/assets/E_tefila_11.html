    Chapter Eleven: The Times of <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> and <em>Shacharit</em>
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Morning
</h2>
<p>
    The first time of the day that has halachic significance is known as "<strong><em>amud hashachar</em></strong>" or "<em>alot hashachar</em>" (dawn). In a
    case of extenuating circumstances, one may begin reciting <em>Shema</em> and praying the <em>Amidah</em> from the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>, but
    under normal conditions it is prohibited. The <em>Acharonim</em> disagree whether <em>amud hashachar</em> is the time when the first glimmer of light
    appears in the east (<em>Magen Avraham</em>, <em>Pri Megadim</em>), or slightly afterwards, when that first light spreads out somewhat upon the eastern sky
    (<em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, <em>Gra</em>).
</p>
<p>
    After <em>amud hashachar</em>, the time called "<strong><em>misheyakir</em></strong>" arrives. This is when enough light has already spread over the earth
    so that a person can recognize a friend, whom he is not accustomed to meeting, from a distance of four <em>amot</em>. At that time it is also possible to
distinguish between <em>techelet</em> (a shade of skylike blue) and white. According to most <em>poskim</em>, <em>l'chatchilah</em> one may recite    <em>Keriat Shema</em> then, but the time to recite the <em>Amidah</em> <em>l'chatchilah</em> has not yet arrived.
</p>
<p>
"<strong><em>Netz hachamah</em></strong>" is sunrise, when the first part of the sun is visible. At that moment, the time to recite the <em>Amidah</em><em>l'chatchilah</em> begins. One who recites <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> right before sunrise and prays the<em> Amidah</em> immediately with    <em>netz hachamah</em> is known to be praying "<strong><em>vatikin</em></strong>," greatly praised by the <em>Chachamim</em>.
</p>
<p>
All of the <em>mitzvot</em> performed during the day, such as <em>brit milah</em>, begin at sunrise, since the time of day is defined by the sun. However,    <em>b'dieved</em>, if they are performed from <em>amud hashachar</em> their obligations are fulfilled because, from a certain standpoint, the day begins
    even from the first glimmer of light (<em>Megillah</em> 20a).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Calculation of the Morning Times</strong>
</h2>
<p>
According to many, the time difference between <em>amud hashachar</em> and <em>netz hachamah</em> in Israel is the time it takes to walk a distance of four    <em>mil</em>, which is approximately 72 minutes. This means that in the months of Nisan or Tishrei, 72 minutes pass from the time the east lights up until
    the time the sun rises.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to understand that the calculation of this time changes according to the seasons of the year. During the days of Nisan and Tishrei
(beginning March 5<sup>th</sup> and October 5<sup>th</sup>), the duration of the sun's ascent is shortest, and the sun rises 72 minutes after    <em>amud hashachar</em>. However, during the winter, for reasons which cannot be outlined here, the duration of the sun's ascent continues to lengthen
    until, at the height of winter (December 22<sup>nd</sup>), 78 minutes pass from <em>amud hashachar</em> until <em>netz hachamah</em>. In the summer, the
    time continues to extend even longer until, at its height (June 22<sup>nd</sup>), 88 minutes pass from <em>amud hashachar</em> until <em>netz hachamah</em>
    . In order to determine the precise time of <em>amud hashachar</em> according to this method, one must calculate the time that the sun will reach 16.1
    degrees below the horizon every day - and that is the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>.
</p>
<p>
    These calculations are based on the opinion that <em>amud hashachar</em> begins when the eastern sky is slightly illuminated. However, according to the
    opinion that <em>amud hashachar</em> starts when the first light in the east emerges, indeed its time is earlier, when the sun reaches approximately 17.5
    degrees below the horizon. However, so as not to encounter controversy, it is proper to act in accordance with the later opinion (16.1 degrees below the
horizon). Only when the sky in the east is slightly illuminated does the time of <em>amud hashachar</em> arrive, and from then one may recite    <em>Keriat Shema</em> and pray the <em>Amidah</em> in a case of extenuating circumstances.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    An uncertainty also arises regarding the time of <em>misheyakir</em>. Despite the fact that the <em>Chachamim</em> defined this time as one when it is
possible to distinguish between <em>techelet</em> and white, and when one can recognize a friend whom he is not used to seeing, from a distance of four<em>amot</em>, there is still doubt as to the accuracy of this time. In practice, it is accepted to teach that it is around 50 minutes before    <em>netz hachamah</em>. See the note for its exact time.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>The Time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> </strong>
</h2>
<p>
The time to recite <em>Shema </em>in the morning is learned from the expression that appears in the Torah passage regarded the <em>Shema</em>, "<em>u'vekumecha</em>," "when you get up," meaning the time when people normally wake up. There are people who rise early, from the time of    <em>amud hashachar</em> (approximately 72 minutes before <em>netz</em>),1 therefore, biblically, it is considered the time of waking and from then on one
    may recite <em>Keriat Shema</em>. The reason for this is that the words "when you get up" are written in the singular person, implying that even when only
    a few people arise from their sleep it is time to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em>. One who recites <em>Keriat Shema</em> before then does not fulfill his
    obligation, since his recital precedes the time of waking.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> "created a fence" (<em>asu siyag</em>) to the mitzvah and established not to recite <em>Keriat Shema l'chatchilah</em> until the
    time when more people usually arise from their sleep, at which point there is already more light on the earth and one can recognize his friend from a
    distance of four <em>amot</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:1). This is the time of <em>misheyakir</em> (approximately 50 minutes before <em>netz</em> in
    the days of Nisan).2
</p>
<p>
When a person cannot recite <em>Keriat Shema </em>after the time of <em>misheyakir</em> due to circumstances beyond his control, he may recite it from    <em>amud hashachar</em>. Similarly, <em>b'dieved</em>, if one mistakenly recites <em>Shema</em> from the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>, he fulfills his
    obligation. However, there is a difference between these two cases. If one's reason for reciting <em>Shema</em> early emanates from circumstances beyond
    his control, even if he must do so every day, he fulfills his obligation. But if he recites it early due to error, he fulfills his obligation only if his
    mistake seldom occurs, meaning not more than once a month. If he errs more often than that, the <em>Chachamim</em> penalize him; he has not fulfilled his
    obligation and he must go back and recite it again after <em>misheyakir</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:3-4; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 58:19).
</p>
<p>
    The time to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> lasts until the conclusion of the first three hours of the day, for there are people, such as princes, who
    continue to sleep until the end of the first three hours. Therefore, until the end of the first three hours is still considered to be the time of "when you
    get up" (this is clarified further in <em>halachot</em> 10 and 11).
</p>
<p>
The most praiseworthy time to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> is at <em>vatikin</em>, meaning slightly before <em>netz hachamah</em>.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>

<a name="4"></a><h2>
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>The Time of the <em>Amidah</em> </strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</em>
    instituted praying three prayers every day, and established their times to correspond to the <em>Tamid</em> offerings. The morning <em>Tamid</em> was
brought starting from <em>amud hashachar</em>, and based on that, the time of praying <em>Shacharit</em> <em>l'chatchilah</em> should begin at    <em>amud hashachar</em>. Nonetheless, the <em>Chachamim</em> say that it is proper to recite the <em>Amidah</em> after <em>netz hachamah</em>, as it is
    written (Psalms 72:5), "<em>Yera'ucha im shamesh</em>" ("Let them fear You from when the sun [shines]") (<em>Berachot</em> 9b). <em>B'dieved</em>, if one
    recites the <em>Amidah</em> from <em>amud hashachar</em>, he fulfills his obligation because he prayed at the time when the morning <em>Tamid </em>offering
    was brought (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:1).
</p>
<p>
    The most praiseworthy time to pray follows the manner of the early <em>chasidim</em> (devoted ones) who prayed at <em>vatikin</em>, for they would recite
    the <em>Amidah</em> at <em>netz hachamah</em>.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    The time to pray the <em>Amidah</em> lasts four hours according to Rabbi Yehudah, for that is the last time that the morning <em>Tamid</em> offering may be
    brought. Even though, in the opinion of the <em>Chachamim</em>, the time to offer the <em>Tamid</em> lasts until <em>chatzot</em>, the halachah follows
    Rabbi Yehudah, since in <em>Masechet</em> <em>Eduyot</em>, in which all the <em>mishnayot</em> were chosen as halachah, the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah is
brought. Therefore, the time to recite <em>Shacharit</em> lasts until the end of the first four hours of the day (<em>Berachot</em> 27a). Even so, the    <em>Chachamim</em>'s words were not rejected completely, and if four hours passed and one did not yet recite <em>Shacharit</em>, he may <em>b'dieved</em>
    pray until <em>chatzot.</em> Although his prayer does not have the value of prayer recited on time, nevertheless, it still has certain value (as clarified
    further in halachah 11).
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    <strong>5. </strong>
    <strong><em>Vatikin</em> at <em>Netz HaChamah</em></strong>
</h2>
<p>
    As we mentioned, the most praiseworthy time to recite <em>Shema</em> and to pray the <em>Amidah</em> is as the devoted ones prayed, at <em>vatikin.</em>
    They would recite <em>Shema</em> slightly before <em>netz hachamah</em> and begin to pray the <em>Amidah</em> at <em>netz hachamah</em>. The reason for
    this is that normally only after the sun already shines and life and nature begin to pulsate in full force does a person awaken and recognize that Hashem
    is God. Only then does he accept upon himself the yoke of Heaven and is inspired to pray. However, those who pray <em>vatikin</em> begin early and "lead"
    nature. Even before the sun shines and nature reveals itself in all its beauty and splendor, they accept upon themselves the yoke of Heaven with complete
faith. As soon as the sun rises and the day begins, they are already standing in prayer, ushering in an abundance of blessing to this world.    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> say that anyone who connects redemption to prayer (<em>somech geulah l'tefillah</em>) by praying <em>vatikin</em> is not harmed the
    whole day (<em>Berachot</em> 9b and <em>Tosafot</em> there).
</p>
<p>
    However, if getting up to pray <em>vatikin</em> will cause a person to be tired and unable to learn or work properly, it is better that he pray afterwards.
    Today, when people's lifestyles have changed and important activities such as Torah classes and weddings take place at night, most people find it better
    not to wake up so early and to pray after the time of <em>vatikin</em>.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    <strong>6. </strong>
    <strong>The Precise Times of <em>Vatikin</em> and <em>Netz</em></strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Netz hachamah</em>
    is the time when the sun rises, and even though this definition is presumably clear and simple, in actuality, it is rather complex.
</p>
<p>
    First, the duration of the sun's ascent, which begins from the second we can see the first edge of the sun until it can be seen entirely, lasts
    approximately two and a half minutes. The <em>poskim</em> disagree regarding the exact time of <em>netz hachamah</em>. According to most halachic
authorities, the time of <em>netz</em> is precisely when the first part of the sun is visible, and at that moment it is necessary to begin the    <em>Amidah</em> of <em>vatikin</em>. Yet, there are those who say that <em>netz</em> is at the conclusion of the sun's ascent. Additionally, there are
    those who say that <em>netz</em> lasts the whole two and a half minutes that the sun is rising. Moreover, there are those who say it lasts a few more
    minutes, the entire time that the rays of the sun are still red. In practice, those who pray <em>vatikin</em> make an effort to begin the <em>Amidah</em>
at the time the sun begins to rise, but are not overly strict about this because the other opinions are also taken into consideration.    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    Another uncertainty arises. Are the mountains in the east that block the sunrise taken into consideration, or do we follow the astronomical sunrise (on a
    straight horizon)? It is clear that one who is under a cliff, or behind a tall building which blocks the east from his view, cannot claim that the sunrise
    begins when he himself sees the sun, because, if that was the case, then the sunrise, as far as he is concerned, would likely be towards the afternoon. The
    question is: what is the law, for example, in Jerusalem's Old City, where the Mount of Olives blocks the eastern horizon and consequently the sun becomes
    visible only a few minutes later? Even for those who stand on the Mount of Olives, the mountains of Moav rising over the Jordan Valley block the beginning
    of the sunrise. Some say that the time of <em>netz hachamah</em> is only when one can actually see the sun, meaning after it is visible above the Mount of
    Olives. Others say that we should not take into account a nearby mountain, like the example of the Mount of Olives, since it is possible to walk to it by
    foot, but rather that it is necessary to include the distant mountains of Moav. The difference between the two opinions amounts to a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
    There are those who say that we should not consider the mountains in the east at all; rather we calculate the sunrise according to a straight horizon,
    based on the time that it would be possible to see the sunrise were there no mountains. Nowadays, there are computer programs that allow us to calculate
    the precise astronomical sunrise in each and every location while disregarding the mountains in the east. Many are accustomed to establishing the time of
    sunrise according to this calculation.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>

    <strong>7. </strong>
    <strong>How Early May One Begin to Pray?</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
, a person should not recite the <em>Amidah</em> before <em>vatikin</em> because, according to a number of <em>poskim</em>, the time to pray<em>l'chatchilah</em> begins at <em>netz hachamah</em> and lasts four hours. The ideal time to pray the <em>Amidah</em> is immediately at the start of "<em>vatikin</em>", just as the devoted ones prayed. Therefore, it seems that for a person whose prayer lasts approximately 25 minutes from the beginning
    until the <em>Amidah</em>, the earliest time he may begin to pray is 25 minutes before <em>netz</em>.
</p>
<p>
    One who must be on his way, or must start work earlier, is permitted to begin praying from the time of <em>misheyakir</em>, since by then a little light
has spread over the earth, and that moment is the valid time for the recital of <em>Shema</em> and for the <em>mitzvot</em> of <em>tzitzit</em> and    <em>tefillin</em>. We have already learned that the time of <em>misheyakir</em> is approximately 50 minutes before <em>netz</em> (see note 2).
</p>
<p>
One who needs to pray even earlier should begin his prayer without <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> and proceed until the conclusion of    <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>. When he finishes <em>Yishtabach</em> he must wait for the time of <em>misheyakir</em>, and only then put on his <em>tallit</em>
    and <em>tefillin</em> and continue praying.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>

    <strong>8. </strong>
    <strong>How Early Is One Permitted to Pray in Extenuating Circumstances?</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    In a case of extenuating circumstances, one may recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> from the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>, which is 72 minutes before
sunrise (in the months of Nisan and Tishrei).1 However, as long as it is possible to recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> after the time of    <em>misheyakir</em>, one may not recite them from <em>amud hashachar</em>. For instance, if someone who is traveling can pray while walking or sitting (as
    his friend drives), he must wait for the time of <em>misheyakir</em> and only then recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and recite the <em>Amidah</em> while
    walking or sitting.
</p>
<p>
    If he is able to recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> while he is traveling after the time of <em>misheyakir</em>, but cannot recite the <em>Amidah</em>
    while traveling, he should pray the <em>Amidah</em> earlier after <em>amud hashachar</em> and recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> and <em>Shema</em> while
    traveling, even though he will not merit connecting redemption to prayer.<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<p>
    When it is not possible to recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> while traveling, as, for example, if he does not know <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> by heart,
and it is not possible for him to use a <em>siddur</em>, he may pray earlier since such situations are considered extenuating circumstances. He recites    <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, <em>Korbanot</em>, and <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> before <em>amud hashachar</em>, and when the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>
    arrives, he puts on his <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> without a <em>berachah</em>, recites <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em>, and
    prays the <em>Amidah</em>. When he finishes the <em>Amidah</em>, the time of <em>misheyakir</em> will have already arrived, and at that point he takes hold
of his <em>tzitzit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> and recites the blessings upon them. According to the Ashkenazic <em>minhag</em>, <em>Birkat</em><em>Yotzer HaMeorot</em> may not be recited before the time of <em>misheyakir</em> either; rather, one must delay its recital until after praying the    <em>Amidah</em>.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>

    <strong>9. </strong>
    <strong>Praying <em>Vatikin</em> Individually versus Praying in a <em>Minyan</em> </strong>
</h2>
<p>
The <em>Acharonim</em> disagree over what is preferable: praying <em>vatikin</em> individually, or praying in a <em>minyan</em> after the time of    <em>vatikin</em>? Some say that since the <em>Chachamim</em> praise the person who prays <em>vatikin</em> and teach that no harm befalls him the whole day,
    it is better to pray <em>vatikin</em> individually. Still, others say that it is preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, for prayer in a <em>minyan</em>
    is sure to be heard. Additionally, there are doubts regarding the precise time of <em>vatikin</em> (as clarified in halachah 6), and it is not proper that
an uncertain <em>vatikin</em> prayer takes precedence over prayer in a <em>minyan</em>. Therefore, it is customary to teach that prayer in a<em>minyan</em> is preferable. However a person who regularly prays <em>vatikin</em> in a <em>minyan</em>, and one day does not have a <em>minyan</em> for<em>vatikin</em>, is permitted to pray <em>vatikin</em> individually on that day, so as not to stray from his custom.    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p>
    Regarding a person who has two options, to pray in a <em>minyan</em> before <em>netz</em>, which is the time of prayer <em>b'dieved</em>, or to pray
    individually afterwards at <em>vatikin</em>, there is disagreement. According to many, it is preferable that he pray individually at <em>vatikin</em>.
Still, there are those who say that it is better to pray in a <em>minyan</em> before <em>netz</em>, provided that he starts reciting<em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> after <em>misheyakir</em>. It is advisable for one to ask his rabbi concerning this. If the regular <em>minyan </em>before    <em>netz</em> will be canceled because a number of people decide to pray at <em>vatikin</em> individually, it is preferable that everyone prays together in
    a <em>minyan</em> before <em>netz</em>.<button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>

    <strong> The Proportional Hours and Their Corresponding Laws</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> lasts for the first three hours of the day and the time of the <em>Amidah</em> for four hours. "Hours" refers to
    proportional hours. That is to say, the day is divided into twelve equal parts, and each part is called a "proportional hour." In the summer, when the days
    are long, so are the hours, and in the winter when the days are short, the hours are short too.
</p>
<p>
    The question is: when do we begin to calculate the day? According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, the hours of the day are calculated according the hours of
    light. In other words, the calculation begins from <em>amud hashachar</em> and lasts until total darkness. However, according to the <em>Gra</em>, the
    calculation is based on the hours that the sun is visible, meaning from sunrise until sunset.<button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p>
    The time difference between <em>amud hashachar</em> and <em>netz</em> is approximately 72 minutes during the days of Nisan and Tishrei. Thus, according to
the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, we begin calculating the three hours of the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> 72 minutes before the time according to the    <em>Gra</em>. Therefore, the last possible time to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is earlier.
    However, it is not 72 minutes earlier because every hour according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is longer, and that way it comes out that at the end of
    six hours we arrive at<em> chatzot</em> according to both calculations.<button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>

    <strong>11. </strong>
    <strong> The Practical Halachah Regarding the Final Time to Recite <em>Shema</em> and Pray the <em>Amidah</em></strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The time to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> lasts for the first three hours of the day, for until then people are still waking up. In that way, one indeed
    fulfills the mitzvah of reciting <em>Shema</em> "<em>u'vekumecha</em>," ("when you get up") - when people wake from their sleep. Most <em>poskim</em> favor
the opinion of the <em>Gra</em>. However, regarding <em>Keriat Shema</em>, whose time is biblical, it is correct to be stringent like the    <em>Magen Avraham</em>, in accordance with the rule, "<em>sefeika d'oraita l'chumra</em>" ("When there is uncertainty concerning biblical commandments we
    are stringent.") Nevertheless, there are those who are accustomed <em>l'chatchilah</em> to follow the <em>Gra</em>'s approach, and one should not oppose
    this custom.
</p>
<p>
    Even though the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> only lasts three hours, if the third hour passed and one did not recite it, he must recite it with its
    blessings sometime within the fourth hour, and he is merited for reciting it like one who reads from the Torah (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:6).
</p>
<p>
    The time of the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer and <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> lasts for four hours, for the <em>Chachamim</em> established its time
    corresponding to the <em>Tamid</em> offering which was brought until the end of the fourth hour of the day. Since its obligation is rabbinic, the halachah
    is lenient and allows us to rely upon the <em>Gra</em>'s approach and to pray later. Even so, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, those who are expeditious fulfill
their obligations early. Therefore, it is good to follow the approach of the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and pray early (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 58:4).    <button type="button" id="1015" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 15</button>
</p>
<p>
If four hours passed and one did not yet recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> nor pray the <em>Amidah</em>, it is agreed that he may pray the    <em>Amidah</em> until <em>chatzot</em>. Although the halachah follows Rabbi Yehudah who rules that the time of <em>Shacharit</em> is until the end of four
    hours, and does not follow the opinion of the <em>Chachamim</em> who maintain that the time is until <em>chatzot</em>, nevertheless, even Rabbi Yehudah
    admits that one who did not pray before four hours lapsed may, <em>b'dieved</em>, complete his prayer until <em>chatzot</em>. Although he is not merited
for praying on time, he does receive merit for his prayer. One may not pray <em>Shacharit</em> after <em>chatzot</em> (<em>Berachot</em> 27a;    <em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 89:1).<button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p>
Regarding <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em>, the <em>poskim</em> disagree. According to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (58:6) and most <em>poskim</em>,    <em>Chazal</em> are only lenient concerning the <em>Amidah</em> and permit one to recite it until <em>chatzot</em>. The reason for this is that, in
    principle, a person is allowed to pray <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> as a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>) at any time. Therefore, in any situation
    of uncertainty, one may pray. However, <em>Birkot Keriat Shema </em>may not be recited as a voluntary prayer. Hence, one who was late and did not recite
    them within the first four hours of the day cannot regain them. According to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, if his reason for missing their recital was due
to circumstances beyond his control, he is permitted to recite them until <em>chatzot</em> (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> there).    <button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>

    <strong> Praying in a <em>Minyan</em> vs. Abiding by the Times</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Since the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the recital of <em>Shema</em> together with its <em>berachot</em>, and established praying the <em>Amidah</em>
    immediately following, <em>l'chatchilah</em> the time of <em>Shacharit</em> should be set to allow people to succeed in reciting <em>Shema</em> before the
    first three hours of the day have ended according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>.
</p>
<p>
When the congregation is late to pray and there is concern that those praying will recite the <em>Shema</em> after the time according to the    <em>Magen Avraham</em>, the people praying should be instructed to recite the paragraph of <em>Shema </em>before beginning to pray. One who wishes to
    enhance the mitzvah should read all three paragraphs.<button type="button" id="1018" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 18</button>
</p>
<p>
    When the congregation prays even later and recites the <em>Amidah</em> after the time to pray has already ended according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>,
    the <em>poskim</em> disagree as to what is preferable. There are those who say that it is better to pray in a <em>minyan</em> within four hours according
    to the <em>Gra</em>, because that is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em>. Further, the time of <em>Shacharit</em> is rabbinic and we are lenient
when there is uncertainty regarding rabbinic rulings. Additionally, in cases of extenuating circumstances one may recite <em>Shacharit</em> until    <em>chatzot</em>. Therefore, it is best to pray in a <em>minyan</em> as the <em>Chachamim</em> established, even if the congregation prays after the time
    to pray has ended according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>. Nevertheless, there are those who say that it is better to pray individually at the proper time
according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, rather than to pray in a <em>minyan</em> after the time to pray has ended according to him.    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
</p>
<p>
    However, if the <em>minyan</em> is not conducted in accordance with the halachah and prays after four hours have passed according to the <em>Gra</em>, all
    opinions agree that one must pray individually prior such a late <em>minyan</em>.<button type="button" id="1020" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 20</button>
</p>
<p>
    One who does not have <em>tefillin</em> must not delay praying until after the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, when he will have
them, since <em>b'dieved</em> one is permitted to fulfill the mitzvah of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em> without <em>tefillin</em> (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 46:33; further in this book 12:9).

The Talmud in <em>Pesachim</em> 93b-94a brings the dispute concerning how much time passes from <em>amud hashachar</em> (dawn) until            <em>netz hachamah</em> (sunrise). According to Ula it is approximately the amount of time it takes to walk the distance of five <em>mil</em>, and
            according to Rav Yehudah, four <em>mil</em>. The <em>Rishonim</em> disagree concerning how long it takes to walk the distance of a <em>mil</em>.
            There are those who say 18 minutes (<em>Rambam</em> in his commentary on <em>Mishnah Berachot</em> 1:1), some who say 22.5 minutes, and others who
            say 24 minutes (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 459:2 and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> there). In practice, there are two main
            opinions: 1) 72 minutes, approximately the amount of time it takes to walk the distance of four <em>mil</em> (where every <em>mil</em> is 18
            minutes). 2) Ninety minutes (where every <em>mil</em> is 22.5 minutes), which is what is printed in many calendars. Also see Rav Chaim Benish's
            book <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 21:6-9.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and <em>Pri Megadim</em>, <em>amud hashachar</em> is the appearance of the first light in the east, and
according to <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> and the <em>Gra</em> it arrives a little later, when the eastern skies are illuminated. The            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 58:4 and section 89:1 favors the latter opinion. One should know that both opinions are talking about a very slight light
            visible in the east, and someone who is in a place that has electric lighting, or one who comes from an illuminated area and has constricted
            pupils, cannot distinguish between these changes in the east. Similarly, a person who is not accustomed to seeing <em>amud hashachar</em> usually
            cannot detect the first light in the east, nor even discern when the eastern skies are slightly illuminated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach that maintains that the time from <em>amud hashachar</em> until <em>netz</em> <em>hachamah</em> is 72 minutes is understandable since
            in Jerusalem in the days of Nisan and Tishrei, the eastern skies are illuminated 72 minutes before <em>netz</em>. At that time, the sun is 16.1
            degrees below the horizon. The rest of the year is calculated according to that same position of the sun during the days of Nisan and Tishrei, as I
            have written above. Still, there are those who maintain that the calculation of 72 minutes is consistent throughout the whole year and their proof
            is from the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Pesachim</em> which provides a fixed measure - four <em>mil</em>. However, this opinion is problematic, for the
            determining factor is when the east becomes illuminated and not how much time has passed. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 261:2 s.v. "<em>Shehu</em>"
            writes similar ideas. Therefore, it must be that the time that lapses between <em>amud hashachar</em> and <em>netz</em> <em>hachamah</em>
            fluctuates according to the seasons of the year. See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> chapter 17, as well as chapter 16, where he explains the reasons
            for the differences according to the seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worthy of mention that all these calculations pertain to Jerusalem and to all locations along the same parallel line of latitude. The closer
a person gets to the north and south poles, the longer the time difference becomes between <em>amud hashachar</em> and <em>netz</em>            <em>hachamah</em>. Even in Israel there are distinctions. In Tzfat, which is north of Jerusalem, the time difference is longer than Jerusalem by
            approximately a minute and a half.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many calendars calculate <em>amud hashachar</em> as 90 minutes before <em>netz</em> in the days of Nisan and Tishrei, when the sun is 19.75 degrees
beneath the horizon. Based on this calculation, in the height of the summer, <em>amud hashachar</em> comes out to be 112 minutes before            <em>netz</em>. This is very problematic, because in all these times, there is no visible light in the east. According to the astronomical
            calculation, before the sun arrives at 18 degrees below the horizon, even people with excellent eyesight cannot notice any light, all the more so
            when it is 19.75 degrees beneath the horizon. Therefore, in practice it is very difficult to rely on these calendars.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the opinion which maintains that four <em>mil</em> is 90 minutes can be explained as referring to the height of summer, since then at
approximately 90 minutes before <em>netz</em>, the east is illuminated. It is also possible to say that according to this approach,            <em>amud hashachar</em> is the first light in the east, and is seen when the sun is approximately 17.5 degrees below the horizon. In the days of
            Nisan and Tishrei, it is approximately 78 minutes before <em>netz</em>; in the height of the winter 85 minutes before <em>netz</em>; and in the
            height of the summer, 96 minutes before <em>netz</em>. Perhaps 90 minutes before <em>netz</em> is the average time at which one can see the first
            light in the east. (In addition, this opinion may possibly follow the approaches which put <em>netz</em> a few minutes later, since it takes the
            mountains into consideration, see halachah 6, and then indeed 90 minutes before <em>netz</em> comes out to be the average time throughout the whole
            year. Even the approach which maintains that a <em>mil</em> is 24 minutes and 4 <em>mil</em> is 96 minutes can be explained as referring to the
            height of summer.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, in summary, the law is established based on the position of the sun. There are two main approaches. The first is when the east is
            illuminated, when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon, which comes out to be 72 minutes before <em>netz</em> in the days of Nisan and
            Tishrei. The second is from the first light, when the sun is 17.5 degrees below the horizon, which is 78 minutes before <em>netz</em> in the days
            of Nisan and Tishrei. I have chosen to write primarily according to the opinion which maintains that <em>amud hashachar</em> is when the eastern
            skies are illuminated, when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon, because that is the opinion favored by the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>, and
            what is written by the <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 2:8, based on the <em>Rambam</em> and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>. In addition to that, those who follow
            this opinion regarding the matter of <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em> fulfill their obligation according to all, for by that time the
            day has certainly begun; however, the time prior to that is controversial. It is possible to accurately calculate these times anywhere with the
            help of Rav Eitan Tzikuni's computer program, "<em>Chazon Shamayim</em>."
        </p>

            <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
In the halachic writings of the <em>Acharonim</em>, a number of opinions are mentioned regarding designating the time of <em>misheyakir</em>. The            <em>Yechaveh Da'at</em> 2:8 writes that it is 66 minutes before <em>netz</em>, and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 18:18 writes 60. In Jerusalem they follow
50-55 minutes before <em>netz</em>, and in some places in Bnei Brak, 45 minutes before <em>netz</em>. In practice, many books, such as            <em>Tefillah Kehilchatah</em> 3:4 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 18:1, write that it is approximately 50 minutes before <em>netz</em>. However, as we
            have learned, there are differences between the seasons of the year, and it is difficult to comprehend how these opinions ignore those
            discrepancies. Perhaps some of the <em>poskim</em> who write different times do not disagree at all, but rather each calculated the time at a
            different season of the year. See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 23:6.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to different visual observations, some <em>poskim</em> acknowledged the time of <em>misheyakir</em> to be when the sun reaches 12 degrees
            below the horizon, some say 11 degrees, and others only 10 degrees. <strong>In practice</strong>, it seems that it should be calculated according
            to the position of the sun when it reaches 11 degrees below the horizon. This comes out to 48 minutes before <em>netz</em> during Nisan and
            Tishrei, 52.5 minutes before <em>netz</em> at the height of winter (December 22<sup>nd</sup>), and 58 minutes before <em>netz</em> at the height of
summer (June 22<sup>nd</sup>). Indeed, most of the year it comes out to around 50 minutes. Nevertheless, it is good to postpone the time of            <em>misheyakir</em> another five minutes, although in extenuating circumstances, one may make it five minutes earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            I should add that in the past, when there were no clocks and people did not wear watches, these times were surely calculated according to human
            eyesight, and if the day was cloudy, the time of <em>misheyakir</em> was delayed a bit so as to avoid uncertainty. However, now that there are
            clocks and watches, <em>Shut Sho'el U'Meishiv</em>, Third Edition, part 2, 162, writes that the times are calculated according to them.
        </p>

            <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
            According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> begins at<em> misheyakir</em> and lasts for three hours, but the
ideal time to pray is <em>vatikin</em>. This is the opinion of <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, <em>Rashba</em>,<em>Tur</em> and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:1. I have written above according to this opinion. However, there are additional opinions. According to            <em>Rabbeinu</em> <em>Chananel</em> and <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> starts after <em>netz</em> and lasts until the end
            of the first three hours of the day, and in their opinion, those who pray <em>vatikin</em> do not practice in accordance with halachah, because
            they recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> slightly before <em>netz</em>. It seems though, that even according to them, in cases of extenuating
            circumstances, one may recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> before <em>netz</em>. (Only according to the <em>Razah</em>, one does not fulfill his
obligation of reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> before <em>netz</em>.) In practice, we do not take into consideration their opinions as halachah. The<em>Rif</em> and the <em>Rambam</em> maintain that the main time for <em>Keriat Shema</em> is <em>vatikin</em>, meaning slightly before            <em>netz</em>,<strong> </strong>and if one did not recite it at <em>vatikin</em>, he may do so until the conclusion of the first three hours of the
day. The time prior to that is valid only in extenuating circumstances. <em>Halachot</em> 7 and 8 of this chapter clarify how much earlier            <em>Shacharit</em> may be recited in practice.

            See <em>Beit Yosef</em> 89:1 and <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 89:2. <strong>In summary</strong>, there are three main opinions: 1) According to
            the <em>Rambam</em> and <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em>, the essence of the institution of <em>Shacharit</em> is from <em>netz</em> until the end of
four hours, and only <em>b'dieved</em> one may pray from <em>amud hashachar</em>, as ruled in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:1 and<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4. 2) According to the <em>Rosh</em>, the <em>Gemara</em> teaches that <em>vatikin</em> is the ideal time, as it says, "<em>Yera'ucha im shamesh</em>" ("Let them fear you from when the sun [shines]"), but the time before <em>Netz</em> and the four hours after it are
equal, for any time that is valid for offering the <em>Tamid</em> is valid for praying <em>Shacharit</em>. 3) According to<em> Rabbeinu Yerucham</em>, the time to pray <em>b'dieved</em> is from <em>amud hashachar</em> until <em>misheyakir</em>, and from            <em>misheyakir</em> until <em>netz</em> is the time to pray <em>l'chatchilah</em>, as well as the time after <em>netz</em>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="ftn5">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>
From the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Berachot</em> 9b it can be inferred that the main objective of <em>vatikin</em> is that one will pray the<em>Amidah</em> at <em>netz</em>, as understood from many <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em>. However, it is implied from the<em>Mishnah</em> in <em>Berachot</em> 22b that there is reason to recite <em>Shema</em> before <em>netz</em> too. Hence, the virtue of            <em>vatikin</em> possesses two aspects, <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>. Therefore, there are those who are strict to ensure that
even when they cannot pray at the time of <em>vatikin</em>, they at least recite the <em>Shema</em> before <em>netz</em>, as written in            <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 58:4, even if they did not yet put on their <em>tefillin</em>. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 58:8 writes, though, that if a
            person has not yet put on his <em>tefillin</em>, he should not recite <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema</em> before <em>netz</em>. This law is also
contingent upon the dispute in section 46:9 where, according to the <em>Beit Yosef</em> and the <em>Rama</em>, one may fulfill his obligation of<em>Keriat Shema</em> without its <em>berachot lechatchilah</em>, whereas according to the <em>Ra'ah</em> and the <em>Gra</em>, it is only            <em>b'dieved</em>.

    <div id="ftn6">
        <p>
            <a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>
            According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, <em>netz </em>is the beginning of the sun's ascent, as writes the <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>, 58:1,
            s.v. "<em>Kemo</em>," and <em>Halachah Berurah</em> (<em>Yosef</em>) 58:7. <em>Ish Matzliach</em> writes that it is the end of the sun's ascent
            (see <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 89:3). According to the <em>Razah</em>, it is the whole duration of the sun's ascent. Others say that even slightly
            after that, as long as the sun is close to the earth and the rays of the sun are still red, it is still considered "<em>Yera'ucha im shamesh</em>"
            ("Let them fear You from when the sun [shines]"), as can be inferred from the <em>Rambam</em>, responsa 255. (See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em>
            24:3-4).

            <em>Divrei Yosef</em>
            writes that the law depends on actually seeing the sun, and therefore it is necessary to take into consideration the places that the Mount of
            Olives conceals. However, according to the <em>Maharil Diskin</em>, (brought in <em>Sefer Nivreshet</em>), what is concealed by the Mount of Olives
            does not enter into the equation since it is closer than the walking distance of one day, but we do take into consideration the parts concealed by
            the Mountains of Moav (although he does not resolve the matter of Shabbat with regard to sunset). Further, there is uncertainty about a city that
            is built on mountains: does each neighborhood follow according to its own height or does the whole city practice according to the highest
            neighborhood in the city, where the sun is visible first? The <em>minhag</em> is to go by the highest neighborhood. An additional doubt is raised -
            if a skyscraper was built in a city, on the top of which the first rays of the sun shine a minute before the sunrise can be seen on the ground,
            what is the ruling? Similarly, if the city is very large, do we still go by the highest point in the city, or, due to the city's size is each area
            defined by itself? See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah </em>chapter 7, which mentions these doubts and cites the different opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even according to the opinion that sunrise and sunset are calculated along a straight horizon, there is doubt as to which height we use to make the
            calculations, since the higher the place, the earlier the sun is visible when it rises, and the later the sun is seen when it sets. For example, at
            a height of 800 meters (2624.67 feet) above sea level, the sun is still visible at sunset approximately 4.6 minutes later than on sea level, and at
            sunrise approximately 4.6 minutes earlier. Indeed, this opinion is divided into three approaches. Some say that we go according to the sunrise on a
            straight horizon based on the height of the place, while there is still uncertainty with regard to the law of a city in which there are mountains
and valleys, i.e., whether we go by each area in the city for itself or the highest point in the city. It is the opinion of the            <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> that in all places we go according to the sunrise at a height of 800 meters above sea level, the altitude of
            Jerusalem. So it is written in <em>Igrot Moshe Orach</em> <em>Chaim</em> 1:97. (This means that even when the people praying are at sea level, the
            time of <em>netz</em> will be 4.6 minutes before they can actually see the sun.) Others say that we go by the astronomical sunrise without taking
            the mountains into account at all; instead we calculate how it would look at sea level (which covers most of the earth's surface) without
            mountains, as <em>Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer</em> writes. See <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> chapter 7, where all this is discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the computer program "<em>Chazon Shamayim</em>," it is possible to determine the precise astronomical time of sunrise in any place, on any day,
            based on the lines of latitude and longitude and the height of the location. Since the result obtained from a program such as this one is more
            accurate than all the calculations done by visual observations, many have been accustomed to calculate the time of sunrise with this program. In
            practice, all the communities living in <em>Gav Hahar</em> (settlements in the heart of the Shomron) do not need to take into account the mountains
            and valleys to the east of them, for if they were to take them into consideration, they would need to calculate a different time for every house,
            each according to its height, and according to the mountains that block them from the east, in every season based on the place of the sun's ascent.
            Therefore, we follow the astronomical horizon, according to the highest point in that location. In the past, when people lived in open areas, the
            sunrise was perceptible, and this ruling was mainly based on the visibility of the sun. However, today, when most people live among many buildings,
            and do not see sunrise, and our methods of calculation have become easier, the sunrise is calculated according to the astronomical horizon. At that
            time, the rays of the sun are also visible in the highest places in the area. However, when to the east, there is a range of distant mountains that
            evenly cover the horizon, like, for instance, in the coastal plains of Israel, and they delay the visibility of the sun from that whole area by a
few minutes, it seems, that it is necessary to take them into consideration and postpone the time of <em>netz</em>. (The time of            <em>misheyakir</em> is dependent upon light, based on the explanation in note 2, when the sun is eleven degrees below the astronomical horizon, and
            there is no connection to the visible sunrise).

            <em>L'chatchilah</em>
, one may not recite the <em>Amidah</em> before <em>vatikin</em> because, according to most <em>poskim</em>, among them the <em>Rambam</em> and            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, the time from <em>amud hashachar</em> until <em>netz hachamah</em> is valid for prayer only <em>b'dieved</em>, as
explained in note 4 of this chapter. Also, in terms of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, according to a few <em>poskim</em> (<em>Rambam</em> and<em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>) the time of <em>misheyakir</em> until <em>netz</em> is <em>b'dieved</em>. Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is            <em>l'chatchilah</em> regarding <em>Keriat Shema</em>. However, since <em>Keriat Shema</em> is adjoined to the <em>Amidah</em>, one may not pray
            the <em>Amidah</em> <em>l'chatchilah</em> before <em>vatikin</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In times of need, one may recite the<em> Amidah</em> at <em>misheyakir</em>, for that is when the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> begins according to
            most <em>poskim</em>, as the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:1 rules, and as is clarified earlier in note 3 of this chapter. That is also when the time
to put on <em>tzitzit</em> and <em>tefillin </em>begins, as explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 18:3; 30:1. One may finish            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> and <em>Yishtabach</em> before that, and when the time of <em>misheyakir</em> arrives, wrap himself in a <em>tallit</em>
            and put on <em>tefillin</em>, as brought by <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 58:1, s.v. "<em>Zeman</em>." However, one may not do so earlier than that,
since only in extenuating circumstances may one recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> before <em>misheyakir</em>. The time of            <em>misheyakir</em> is clarified in note 2 of this chapter.

            In <em>Berachot</em> 30a we learn to what extent reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> and its <em>berachot</em> before <em>misheyakir</em> is only for
            extenuating circumstances, since any time it is possible to say them after <em>misheyakir</em>, even while walking, there is an obligation to do
            so. The only question left is when to pray the <em>Amidah</em>. According to <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em>, the <em>Tosafot</em>, and others, one must
            recite the <em>Amidah</em> standing in his house before <em>misheyakir</em>, which is how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:8 rules as well. According
            to <em>Bahag</em>, it is best that he prays while walking so as to connect redemption to prayer, and in practice, that is customarily what is done,
            as explained in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:42 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 54. However, when he can say <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> while
traveling, but cannot pray the <em>Amidah</em>, then he follows <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em> and the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>; he prays the            <em>Amidah</em> standing in his house after <em>amud hashachar</em> and waits to recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> while traveling in order to
            say them after the time of <em>misheyakir</em>. This includes a case in which a person only knows the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Keriat Shema</em> by
            heart and not the <em>Amidah</em>, or one in which a person is driving and he knows that he is capable of reciting <em>Birkot Keriat Shema </em>
            while driving, but praying the <em>Amidah</em> while driving is forbidden (see further in this book 17:16).

            During the days of Nisan and Tishrei, <em>amud hashachar</em> is 72 minutes before <em>netz </em>(when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon).
            In the height of winter (December 22<sup>nd</sup>) it is 78 minutes before <em>netz</em>, and at the height of summer (June 22<sup>nd</sup>) it is
            88 minutes before <em>netz</em>. See note 1 to understand why I have written according to this opinion. At most, it is permissible to be lenient
            and consider <em>amud hashachar</em> the first light in the east (when the sun is 17.5 degrees below the horizon), as explained there. Many
            calendars display <em>amud hashachar</em> as a time when there is no light at all in the eastern sky, and it is very problematic to rely on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In note 2, I wrote that the time of <em>misheyakir</em> is when the sun is 11 degrees below the horizon, which is the average time according to the
            different opinions and observations. However, here, in extenuating circumstances, if one can recite <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> approximately five
            minutes before this time, thereby succeeding to pray the <em>Amidah</em> standing in his house, it is preferable that he does so, instead of
            praying afterwards while walking.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a case of extenuating circumstances, it is permissible to start praying <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> from <em>amud hashachar</em>, as explained
            in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 58:3. One may put on his <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> before that time without a <em>berachah</em>, as
clarified concerning the matter of <em>tzitzit</em> in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 18:3 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 10 and regarding the matter of            <em>tefillin</em> in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 30:3 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 11. However, <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 30:8, based on the <em>Ari</em>,
            writes that one may not put on <em>tefillin</em> before <em>amud hashachar</em>. Additionally, it is explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 1:6 and
47:13 that the passage regarding the <em>Tamid</em> may not be recited before <em>amud hashachar</em> and, according to <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 89:7,            <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> may not be recited before <em>amud hashachar</em> either. However, we have already learned that some <em>poskim</em>
            maintain that <em>amud hashachar </em>is slightly before the time mentioned above and others say it is 90 minutes before <em>netz</em>, as written
in <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 89:1. In extenuating circumstances, with regard to these matters, in which there is no issue of reciting a            <em>berachah</em> in vain, it is permissible to rely on this approach.
        </p>
        <p>
According to many Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em>,<em> Birkat Yotzer HaMeorot</em> may not be recited before <em>misheyakir</em>. So write the            <em>Magen Avraham</em>, <em>Graz</em> 58:6, and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 58:17. Nevertheless, if a person did recite <em>Yotzer HaMeorot</em>
            before <em>misheyakir</em>, since he already fulfilled his obligation according to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 58:19, he
            does not repeat it again after praying (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 58:4, s.v. "<em>B'lo</em>").

According to the <em>Mahari Schwartz</em>, it is preferable to pray <em>vatikin</em>, and according to Rabbi Shlomo Kluger in            <em>HaElef Lecha Shlomo</em> 47, it is preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em>. See <em>Yabia Omer</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, part 1, 4:9, who
hinges the law on <em>kavanah</em>. He maintains that if a person concentrates well, he should pray <em>vatikin</em>, but if he is unable to have            <em>kavanah</em>, it is best that he prays in a <em>minyan</em>. <em>Shut</em> <em>Pri Yitzchak</em> 2 writes that since there are doubts as to
            when exactly <em>vatikin</em> is (as explained in halachah 6), it is preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em> rather than to pray with uncertainty
at <em>vatikin</em>. That is how we are accustomed to rule. However, since there are those who disagree, an individual who wants to pray            <em>vatikin</em> from time to time may rely on their opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>
            58:1 writes that people who are careful to pray <em>vatikin</em> every day in a <em>minyan</em> are permitted to pray individually when they do not
have a <em>minyan</em>. In <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 5:17 the explanation given is that these people have a sort of vow, both regarding praying            <em>vatikin</em> and praying in a <em>minyan</em>, and therefore they may choose how they wish to practice.

            We learned in halachah 4 and in note 4 that according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, as well as the rulings of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
            89:1 and the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4, the time before <em>netz</em> is valid for prayer only <em>b'dieved</em>. Additionally, we learned in the
            previous note that there are those who say that even when the prayer in a <em>minyan</em> is conducted after <em>netz</em>, it is nevertheless
preferable to pray at <em>vatikin</em>. Therefore, the result is that according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, it is best to pray at<em>vatikin</em> individually and not before <em>netz</em> in a <em>minyan</em>. So writes the <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 14:1 and            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 89:14.
        </p>
        <p>
However, we learned that according to the <em>Rosh</em> and <em>Rabbeinu Yerucham</em> the time for prayer <em>l'chatchilah</em> starts from<em>misheyakir</em>, and the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:1 writes that people who are awake on Shavuot night may pray in a <em>minyan</em> before            <em>netz</em>. Additionally, <em>Yaskil Avdi</em>, part 5, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 10:4, and <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 7:4 write that it is
preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em> before <em>netz</em>, for that is a case of extenuating circumstances, since he will not have another            <em>minyan</em> after that. That is also the opinion of the <em>Chazon Ish</em> (brought by the <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 13:6).
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems to me that as a ruling to many it is preferable to preserve the prayer in a <em>minyan</em>, for prayer in a <em>minyan</em> is accepted
and the power of communal worship is important in preserving the permanence of prayer. Only for a person who wishes out of piety to pray at<em>vatikin</em>, it may be preferable to pray at <em>vatikin</em>. However, ordinarily, it is best to pray in a <em>minyan</em> before            <em>netz</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the more so in a small community, where a few of the congregants must leave early for work and they will not have another opportunity to
organize a <em>minyan</em> after <em>netz</em>, this is considered to be a case of extenuating circumstances, and they must arrange the            <em>minyan</em> to pray before <em>netz</em>. It is proper even for those individuals who can pray later on, to participate as well. (Although, if
they want to wake up early, complete the early <em>minyan</em>, respond to their <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em>, and then pray            <em>vatikin</em> later individually, they are permitted to do so).

The <em>poskim</em> who maintain that we calculate from <em>amud hashachar</em> are: <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em>, the <em>Bach</em>, and<em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>. This is also implied from a number of <em>Rishonim</em>, among them <em>Rashi</em>, <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Ramban</em>, and            <em>Rashba</em> (see <em>HaZemanim BaHalachah</em> 13:2). Although the <em>Magen Avraham</em> himself (233:3; 443:3) is uncertain as to whether the
calculation is to be made from <em>amud hashachar</em> or from <em>netz</em> <em>hachamah</em>, nevertheless, he rules stringently (58:1) because            <em>Keriat Shema</em> is a biblical mitzvah and therefore the calculation is given in his name.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast to them, maintaining the <em>Gra's</em> approach are <em>Rabbeinu Chananel</em>, <em>Rasag</em>, <em>Rav Hai Gaon</em>, <em>Rambam</em>
            , <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, and others. <em>Acharonim</em> who follow this approach include the <em>Levush</em>, <em>Tosafot YomTov</em>,
and the <em>Graz</em>. It is also the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em> (see there 13:7-9). The <em>Gra's</em> reason (            <em>Bei'ur HaGra</em> 459, <em>Shenot</em> <em>Eliyahu</em>,<em> </em>the beginning of<em> Masechet Berachot</em>) is that the times of the day and
            the night are identical, and therefore one 24-hour period is divided into twelve hours for the day and twelve for the night. In calculating a whole
            year, the hours of the day and night are identical. This is only possible if the day is calculated according to the sun, for then the days and
            nights of the whole year are equal. This is not true if the calculation is made from <em>amud hashachar</em> until darkness, for then the days
            would be more than two hours longer than the nights.
        </p>

            <a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" title="">[14]</a>
            According to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>'s approach, there are those who calculate the hours of the day from <em>amud hashachar</em> until the
            emergence of three stars, and then the result is that before <em>netz</em>, 72 minutes are added, whereas after sunset only 18 or 13.5 minutes are
            added (<em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> 233:3, <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Vayakhel</em> 4; <em>Divrei Yosef</em>). However, their opinion is problematic,
for based on their calculations, <em>chatzot </em>arrives before the sun reaches the middle of the sky, and therefore the final time for            <em>Keriat Shema</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> comes out earlier than it actually is. <em>Rav Tikochinsky</em>, along with the
prominent rabbis of Jerusalem, solved this problem by establishing the time after sunset as equal to the time before sunrise. If            <em>amud hashachar</em> precedes <em>netz</em> by 72 minutes, then even after sunset 72 minutes are added. That way, it always comes out that the
first six hours of the day end at <em>chatzot</em>, both according to the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and according to the time of the            <em>Gra</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on this, it is easy to calculate the difference in time between the final time according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and the final time
            according to the <em>Gra</em>. First, we must calculate the time between <em>amud hashachar</em> and <em>netz</em> and divide it into six. For
            example, according to the calculation of the days of Nisan and Tishrei, when <em>amud hashachar</em> is 72 minutes earlier than <em>netz</em>,
            every hour according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is longer by twelve minutes. If so, the difference in time between them after three hours is
            reduced by 36 minutes. This means, that the final time to recite <em>Shema</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is 36 minutes earlier than
            the time of the <em>Gra</em>, and the final time to pray the <em>Amidah</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, is 24 minutes earlier.
            However, based on what we learned in note 1 concerning the changes in the time of <em>amud hashachar</em> in the different seasons of the year, it
            comes out that in the height of winter, the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is 39 minutes earlier, and in the
            height of summer, it is 44 minutes earlier than the time of the <em>Gra</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since this is an uncertainty concerning a biblical obligation, it seems that it is correct to make the calculation according to the position of the
sun at 17.5 degrees below the horizon, for at that time the first light is visible, and some <em>poskim</em> maintain that time as            <em>amud hashachar</em>, as explained in note 1. Based on this, in the days of Nisan and Tishrei, <em>amud hashachar</em> is 78 minutes earlier
than <em>netz</em>, and the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is 39 minutes earlier than that of the            <em>Gra</em>. In the height of winter it is 42.5 minutes earlier, and in the height of summer it is 48 minutes earlier. In many calendars, the
            calculations are made according to the position of the sun at 19.75 degrees below the horizon, and then the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is
            earlier by approximately 45 minutes in Nisan and by 56 minutes in the height of the summer. However, as I already wrote in note 1, this approach is
            very problematic because at that time no light is visible in the east. Additionally, some <em>poskim</em> calculate 90 minutes before <em>netz</em>
            and only 18 minutes after sunset, and the result is that the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em> is earlier than the <em>Gra's</em> time by more
            than an hour. Hence, as aforementioned, this opinion is very problematic.

There are those who wish to say that the Ashkenazic custom follows the <em>Gra</em>, and that <em>Sephardim</em> practice like the            <em>Magen Avraham</em>. Indeed, the <em>Chida</em> writes that where he lived the people were accustomed to follow the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and,
in contrast, the <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 1:24 writes that in Lithuania they practiced like the <em>Gra</em> also regarding<em>Keriat Shema</em>. However, the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 58:3; 89:6 writes that the Sephardic <em>minhag</em> is not necessarily like the            <em>Magen Avraham</em>. Additionally, in Ashkenaz, many were stringent <em>l'chatchilah</em> concerning <em>Keriat Shema</em> and practiced like
            the <em>Magen Avraham</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 58:4).

            The explanation that the time of <em>Shacharit</em> lasts <em>b'dieved</em> until <em>chatzot</em> is brought by the <em>Beit Yosef</em>, and that
            is the opinion of the majority of <em>poskim</em>. However, some say that Rabbi Yehudah does not accept the <em>Chachamim</em>'s opinion and "after
            four hours" is the time of <em>tashlumim </em>(reciting a prayer that was missed). If so, whoever purposely did not pray during the first four
hours may not pray <em>tashlumim</em>, in accord with the opinion of the <em>Ra'avan</em>, <em>Pri Chadash</em>, and the <em>Gra</em>. The            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:6 is apprehensive about this, and therefore writes that one who intentionally did not pray during the first four hours
            of the day may pray until <em>chatzot</em> as a voluntary prayer (<em>tefillat nedavah</em>). (The <em>Rashba</em> is more stringent and writes in
            his responsa that after four hours one may not pray at all.)
        </p>
        <p>
Concerning the half hour after <em>chatzot</em>, see <em>Beirur Halachah</em>, <em>Berachot</em>, the beginning of chapter 4. According to the            <em>Beit Yosef</em> and the <em>Rama</em> 89:1, it is forbidden to pray <em>Shacharit</em> in that half-hour. However, since some maintain that it
            is permitted to pray <em>Shacharit</em> at that time, if one mistakenly prayed, he does not recite <em>tashlumim</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
            89:7).

            The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules like the <em>Rosh</em> and the <em>Tur</em> who maintain that the time of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> only lasts
            for four hours. So write the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Va'era</em> 5 and <em>Rav Eliyahu</em> in his <em>siddur</em>. That is also the opinion of
            the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 58:6, as discussed at length. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> supports his words on the opinion of the <em>Rambam</em> and
the <em>Pri Chadash</em> who maintain that <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> may be recited the whole day, and the opinion of the            <em>Mishkenot Yaakov </em>77 who says that the law concerning them is like the law regarding the <em>Amidah</em>, that <em>b'dieved</em> they can
            be recited until noon. The <em>Maharil</em> writes that this is the custom (Ashkenaz). The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> deduces that in a case in which
a person did not recite them due to circumstances beyond his control, he may recite them until <em>chatzot</em>. Although many Ashkenazic<em> poskim</em> rule stringently like the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, among them the <em>Graz</em> and the <em>Chayei Adam</em>, nevertheless many            <em>Ashkenazim</em> also rely on the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, as written in <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 7:15 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 18:7.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
            58:6 writes that concerning the matter of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> it is permissible to practice like the <em>Gra</em>. Although this is a case
            of doubt regarding <em>berachot</em> and presumably it would be proper to refrain from reciting them during a time that is controversial, in
accordance with the rule that states that when there is uncertainty concerning a matter of <em>berachot</em>, we are lenient (            <em>safek berachot l'hakel</em>), nevertheless, since some <em>poskim</em> maintain that the time of <em>Birkot Keriat Shema</em> lasts the whole
            day and others say until <em>chatzot</em>, therefore one may at least be lenient to recite them until four hours like the <em>Gra</em> rules.

            According to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, only the recital of the first verse is a biblical obligation and therefore the <em>Beit Yosef</em>
            and the <em>Rama</em> section 46:9 write that it is good to say the first verse of <em>Shema</em> in the <em>Korbanot</em> passages so as to
            fulfill one's obligation of <em>Keriat Shema</em> with its recital. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 46:31 writes that some say the whole first
            paragraph must be recited, while others say the first two paragraphs (because according to the <em>Pri Chadash</em> both are biblical obligations).
            Ideally a person should recite all three paragraphs, because according to the <em>Pri Chadash</em> it is good to fulfill one's obligation of
            remembering the Exodus during the time that one recites <em>Keriat Shema</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, according to the <em>Gra</em>, based on the <em>Ra'ah</em>, it is not proper to fulfill one's obligation of reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em>
            without its blessings. Nevertheless, in this case, in order to fulfill the obligation of reciting it within <em>Magen Avraham</em>'s time frame, it
            is better to recite it earlier by itself (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 46:9, s.v. "<em>V'Yotzeh</em>"). Whoever sees that the congregation is going to
            miss the time of <em>Keriat Shema</em> according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> by a few minutes, <em>Shut Binyan Olam</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 4,
            writes that he may say it earlier with its <em>berachot</em> and wait at "<em>Shirah Chadashah</em>" for the congregation, thereby meriting the
            recital of <em>Keriat Shema</em> with its <em>berachot</em> within the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, as well as prayer in a <em>minyan</em>.

            Rabbi Akiva Eiger writes that a person who is uncertain as to whether he will succeed in reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> with its <em>berachot</em>
            according to the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em> must recite it before then with a stipulation that if the halachah is like the <em>Gra</em>'s
            approach or if the congregation ends up reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> on time, he does not intend to fulfill his obligation with that recital, and
            will instead fulfill his obligation with the<em> Shema</em> that he will recite together with its <em>berachot</em>. However,<em> Da'at Torah</em>
            and <em>Oneg Yom Tov</em> 3 write that a stipulation cannot be effective for a biblical commandment. Indeed, the <em>Acharonim</em> are in
            disagreement regarding this. Most <em>poskim</em> mention in practice the advice given by Rabbi Akiva Eiger, as written in <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>
            58:5 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 18:18.

            <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em>
            3:71 writes that it is preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em> at the time specified by the <em>Gra</em>. So writes the <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em>
            8:12. By contrast, it is the opinion of<em> Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach</em> (brought by <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 18, note 40) that it is preferable
to pray individually at the time specified by the <em>Magen Avraham</em>. Likewise, regarding the Sephardic <em>minhag</em>, there is disagreement.<em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> writes there that according to <em>Sephardim</em> as well it is preferable to pray in a <em>minyan</em>, However,            <em>Rav Abba Shaul</em> writes that <em>Sephardim</em> practice according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and it is preferable that they pray
            individually instead of in a <em>minyan</em> after the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em>. The <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 89:6 writes that whoever
            always practices according to the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and knows that he will have <em>kavanah</em> throughout the entire <em>Amidah</em>, it is
            preferable that he prays individually within the time of the <em>Magen Avraham</em>. However, if he cannot concentrate well, it is best that he
            prays with the congregation, for then his prayer is heard.

            <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em>
            must be concluded within the first four hours of the day (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 124:7). The <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 7:25 writes in a
            footnote that one may not start <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> after four hours have passed. <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 124:2 s.v. "<em>Sheya'avor</em>"
is uncertain regarding this, for perhaps since the time of prayer lasts <em>b'dieved</em> until <em>chatzot</em>, it is possible to recite            <em>Chazarat HaShatz</em> even after the conclusion of four hours.

            When a person prays earlier than the congregation because the <em>minyan</em> is late, some say he should pray outside the synagogue, and others
say that because they are not practicing in accordance with halachah, he is permitted to pray earlier in their presence. See            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:35. It seems that if by his praying earlier in front of the congregation, the people will learn from him and pray
            earlier too, it is best that he prays in front of them, However, if they will not learn from his example, it is preferable that he prays
            individually elsewhere.
