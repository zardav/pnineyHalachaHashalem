    Chapter Ten: <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> - The Blessings on the Torah
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    1. The Value of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    After the Land of Israel was destroyed, and the nation of Israel was exiled, a major question arose, reflected in the words of the prophet (Jeremiah 9:11):
    "Why has the land been destroyed?" Certainly, everyone knew that we were exiled from our land as a result of our sins, but the question was: what was the
    fundamental sin behind the spiritual collapse that led to the destruction? The <em>Chachamim</em>, the prophets, and the ministering angels were asked this
    question and did not know how to answer, until <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> Himself explained, "Hashem says: 'Because they abandoned My Torah which I had
given them'" (ibid., 9:12). <em>Chazal</em> interpret this to mean that they did not recite the blessing on the Torah before engaging in its study (    <em>Nedarim</em> 81a). That is to say, although they actually learned Torah, they did not relate to it as Divine instruction. Because of this, they were
    considered to have forsaken the Torah of Hashem. For anyone who learns Torah as if it is just one of the wisdoms of the world is not considered one who
    learns Torah at all. However, when we recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> properly, indeed we approach Torah out of faith and attachment to the One who granted
    it to us.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Chachamim</em> further inquire (<em>Nedarim</em> 81a): why is it that not all the sons of <em>talmidei chachamim</em> (Torah scholars) continue in
    their fathers' paths and become <em>talmidei chachamim</em> themselves? For without a doubt the fathers wanted their children to follow in their footsteps
    and become engrossed in Torah all their lives, and strove to educate them in that direction. If so, why did they not all succeed ? Moreover, in those days,
    it was widely accepted that every son continue in his father's profession: sons of carpenters became carpenters, sons of farmers became farmers, and so on.
    Consequently, the <em>Gemara</em>'s question is all the more perplexing - why don't a relatively large percentage of sons of <em>talmidei chachamim</em>
    become <em>talmidei chachamim</em> themselves? There are a number of explanations brought in the Talmud, the last one being Ravina's, which states that it
    is because they do not recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before learning. In other words, many times, sons of <em>talmidei chachamim</em> learn Torah only
    because they see their fathers learning; as sons like to mimic their fathers, they too, strive to learn Torah. However, Torah can only be acquired by
    learning for the sake of Heaven (<em>l'shem Shamayim</em>), out of a personal desire to attach oneself to the One who grants us the Torah, and therefore,
    those sons who learn out of compulsion, routine, or merely mimicking their fathers, do not see blessing in their learning.

    2. The Content of the Torah Blessings and the Ruling Regarding <em>Ahavat Olam</em>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>
    are comprised of three parts. In the first part, we bless Hashem who sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us to occupy ourselves with the
    study of Torah. In the second, we request that the Torah, which Hashem taught His nation Israel, be pleasant to us, that we merit learning it with desire,
    and that we and our offspring have the privilege of understanding the depth of its content.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In the third part, we bless and thank Hashem for choosing us from among all the nations and giving us His Torah. The <em>Chachamim</em> say (    <em>Berachot</em> 11b) that this is the prime <em>berachah</em> of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, since it mentions the unique virtue of the nation of Israel,
    that Hashem "chose us from among all the nations" and, because of this Divine selection, consequently "gave us His Torah." This is the nature of Israel's
    soul, that it is attached and devoted to Hashem and His Torah, and therefore only the nation of Israel can receive the Torah and with it illuminate the
    world. Among the nations of the world, there may be righteous and devout gentiles, but this is a personal piety of individual people who lack the ability
    to repair the entire world. As seen from our long history, only the nation of Israel can serve Hashem within a national framework and strive to uplift and
    rectify the world in the path of truth and kindness.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Based on this, it is clear why the <em>Ahavat Olam</em> <em>berachah</em> ("<em>Ahavah Rabbah</em>," according to <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em>), which we say
    before the recital of <em>Shema</em>, can replace <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. The main part of this prayer refers to Hashem's love for Israel and its
    conclusion is, "Who chooses His people Israel with love." Additionally, the subject of Torah is mentioned at length, for Israel and the Torah are
    inseparable.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In practice, one who is not certain as to whether he recited <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> can have <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation of<em>Birkot HaTorah</em> when reciting <em>Ahavat Olam.</em> Likewise, one who forgets to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before praying and arrives at    <em>Ahavat Olam</em> should have in mind to fulfill his obligation of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> when saying it, and after the prayer service remember to
    learn words of Torah as one does after <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 47:7).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>

<a name="3"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    3. Is the Recital of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> a Biblical Commandment?
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    "Rav Yehudah says in the name of Rav, where do we learn that [the obligation to] recite a blessing prior [to learning Torah] is biblical? As it is written
    (Deuteronomy 32:3), 'When I proclaim Hashem's Name, ascribe greatness to our God'" (<em>Berachot</em> 21a). The interpretation of this verse is that the
    entire Torah is comprised of the names of <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> (<em>Zohar</em>, part 2, 87:1; <em>Tikunei Zohar</em>,<em> Tikun</em> 10) for He is
completely concealed from us, and through the Torah <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> is revealed to the world. Hence, we learn that the Torah is the names of    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> and through it He is manifest. That is the meaning of the verse, "<em>Ki Shem Hashem ekra</em>," "When I proclaim Hashem's
    Name" - before learning Torah, "<em>Havu godel l'Elokeinu</em>," "Ascribe Greatness to our God" - recite a blessing for the Giver of the Torah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In practice, the <em>Rishonim</em> are divided concerning the question of whether these words should be taken literally, making the recital of    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before learning a biblical commandment. According to the <em>Rambam</em> and the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>Orach Chaim</em>
209:3), reciting <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is a rabbinic enactment and what <em>Chazal</em> extrapolated from the verse is none other than an    <em>asmachta</em> (a reference). Based on this, in a case of doubt, one must be lenient and refrain from reciting the blessings, and that is the custom of
    the <em>Sephardim</em> (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 47:2). According to the majority of <em>Rishonim</em>, among them the <em>Ramban</em> and the <em>Rashba</em>,
the source for the mitzvah to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is biblical. Therefore, when a person is uncertain as to whether or not he recited    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, he must be stringent and recite them, in keeping with the rule, <em>sefeika d'oraita l'chumra</em> (we are stringent concerning
matters of biblical uncertainty), and that is the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Ashkenazim</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:1).    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, all opinions agree that if there is a person present who did not yet recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, it is preferable to fulfill one's obligation
by hearing him recite them and in that way avoid uncertainty. When there is no such option, if one is about to pray and recite <em>Ahavat Olam</em> (or    <em>Ahavah Rabbah</em>), he should have <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in his recital of that <em>berachah</em>.
    Nevertheless, if the time to pray has not yet arrived, and there is no one whom he can hear recite the <em>berachot</em>, according to those who maintain
    that the obligation to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is biblical, he must be stringent and recite them out of uncertainty. It is sufficient to recite only
    the third <em>berachah</em>, "<em>Asher bachar banu</em>" ("Who chose us,") for it is the most important from among <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    4. Before What Type of Learning Must the <em>Berachot</em> Be Recited?
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    One must recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before learning any part of the Torah (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em>, 47:2). In other words, even
    one who only intends to learn <em>Midrash</em> or halachah on a particular day must recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> at the onset of that day. The reason for
    this is that the entire Torah - whether it is <em>Torah Shebichtav</em> (the Written Torah) or <em>Torah Sheb'al Peh </em>(the Oral Torah), the halachic
    segments or the philosophical - was all given from Hashem to Moshe on Mount Sinai (<em>Yerushalmi</em>, <em>Pe'ah</em>, chapter 2, halachah 4) and when
    studying them, one must recite, "Who chose us from among all His nations and gave us His Torah."
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is dissension among the <em>poskim</em> regarding whether or not <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> must also be recited before thinking Torah thoughts. For
example, a person who arises in the morning with the desire to ponder a few ideas of Torah, according to most <em>poskim</em> does not need to recite the    <em>berachot</em>. Still, there are those who disagree. In order to avoid uncertainty, one who wakes up and wishes to reflect upon words of Torah should
    first recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and immediately afterwards say a few verses. However, someone who temporarily wakes from his sleep in the middle of
the night, and wants to contemplate Torah ideas until he falls back to sleep, need not recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Those who listen to Jewish music when they wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night do not need to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> since they do
    not have the intention to learn.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One may recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> while standing, sitting, lying down, and walking. Nevertheless, there are those who
    are strict to say <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> while standing, or walking, but not while sitting or lying down.<button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>

<a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    5. <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> for the Whole Day
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>
    are recited in the morning in conjunction with the recital of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, and they encompass all learning performed throughout that day.
    Even if a person goes to eat and to work afterwards, he does not need to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> upon returning to learn.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In that respect <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> differ from other <em>Birkot HaMitzvot</em> (<em>berachot</em> recited upon the performance of a mitzvah).
    Concerning all other <em>mitzvot</em>, every time a person performs the mitzvah anew, he must recite another <em>berachah</em> because the <em>mitzvot</em>
    are only designated for a specific time of the day, or for a particular act. For example, the mitzvah of <em>sukkah</em> requires that a person eat and
    sleep in the <em>sukkah</em>, while at all other times he is permitted to go wherever he desires. Similarly, the mitzvah of <em>tallit</em> can be
    fulfilled after one minute of the day. Therefore, every time one wraps himself anew in his <em>tallit</em>, or goes into the <em>sukkah</em> to eat another
    meal, he must repeat the particular <em>berachah</em> intended for that mitzvah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, the mitzvah of learning Torah is a general mitzvah that encompasses all of a person's days and hours, as it is written (Joshua 1:8), "You shall
meditate thereon day and night." Even if a person learned in the morning, the commandment to learn still applies at night and at every available hour (    <em>Tosafot</em>, <em>Berachot</em> 11b, s.v. "<em>Shekvar</em>"). Further, even when a person is not learning Torah, the Torah guides his life within the
    confines of halachah, <em>middot </em>(proper character traits), and faith. Even when a person is relieving himself or bathing, times at which it is
    prohibited to think Torah thoughts, there are <em>halachot</em> guiding him in these instances also, thus illustrating that no one can ever detach himself
    from Torah (see <em>Agur</em>, section 1, brought by the <em>Beit Yosef</em> 47:11). Therefore, <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> recited in the morning cover all of
    one's learning throughout that day, and any work or business conducted in the interim is not considered to be an interruption (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    47:10).<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>

<a name="6"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    6. Is Sleep Considered an Interruption Regarding <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>?
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>poskim</em> are divided as to whether sleep is considered a break after which it is necessary to repeat the recital of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
According to most <em>Rishonim</em>, among them the <em>Rosh</em>, a person's regular sleep in his bed is considered an interruption regarding    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. The whole time a person is awake, the Torah continuously escorts and guides him. However, when a person sleeps, he ceases to think
    and his consciousness fades. Therefore, sleep is deemed an interruption regarding the mitzvah to learn Torah. Based on this, it is necessary in principle
    to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> even after a nap during the day. Nonetheless, it has been customary to consider daytime sleep, even if it lasts a long
    time, to be temporary sleep, which does not constitute an interruption; hence, <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> recited in the morning are also effective after a
    daytime nap. However, regular sleep at night is an interruption and one must recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> after it. Therefore, one who needs to arise in
    the middle of the night for guard duty, and intends to return to sleep afterwards, recites <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> twice, once when he wakes up for guard
duty, and a second time when he wakes up in the morning. That is the practice of <em>Ashkenazim</em> and many <em>Sephardim</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,    <em> Orach Chaim</em> 47:11; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 29).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are those who say that sleep is not considered to be an interruption concerning <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and that the law of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>
    is similar to the law of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, which are recited once a day. Therefore, one who wakes up in the middle of the night for guard duty
    recites <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> after the first waking and does not recite them after the second time he wakes up (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 47:29; concerning
    the laws of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> see earlier in this book 9:5).<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    7. One Who Was Awake All Night
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Rosh</em> and most of the <em>Rishonim</em>, one who was awake all night, as on Shavuot night, may not recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>
    before <em>Shacharit</em>, because as long as he did not interrupt by sleeping, the previous day's <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> still apply. That is how many
eminent <em>Acharonim</em> rule (<em>Pri Chadash</em>, <em>Gra</em>, <em>Chayei Adam</em>). According to <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, however, he must recite    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before <em>Shacharit</em>. Since <em>Birkot HaTorah </em>are intended to last for a 24-hour period, even if he did not sleep at all
    during that whole day, when the time arrives to recite <em>Shacharit</em> the next day, he must recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> again. That is what is said
in the name of the <em>Arizal</em>, and that is the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Sephardim</em> (<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 46:12; <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>,    <em>Berachah</em> 3; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 47:26).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to avoid uncertainty, it is preferable that someone who did not sleep at night hear someone else recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>,<em> </em>thereby
    fulfilling his obligation according to all opinions.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
If he cannot find someone who needs to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, according to the <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Sephardim</em> and some of the    <em>Ashkenazim</em>, he should recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> himself. According to the <em>minhag</em> of the majority of <em>Ashkenazim</em>, he should
    have <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill the obligation of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in <em>Ahavah Rabbah</em> before <em>Shema</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    47:28), for we have already learned (in halachah 2) that this <em>berachah</em> is considered like <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. After praying he must learn a
    verse of scripture or a <em>Mishnah</em> in order to adjoin his learning to the <em>berachah</em>.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Regarding that same person who stayed awake all night, if he slept a regular sleep during the day prior to that, according to all opinions he must recite    <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before reciting <em>Shacharit</em>.<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button> (See earlier in this book 9:6 for a summary of

The <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> disagree regarding how many <em>berachot</em> are included in <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. According to            <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and others, there are two <em>berachot</em>, and the second part is a continuation of the first. Therefore,
            one must begin "<em>V'Ha'arev</em>" with a connecting <em>vav </em>(<em>vav hachibur</em>) and <em>Amen</em> is not recited upon the conclusion of
            the first part. According to the <em>Rambam</em> and others, there are three <em>berachot</em>; hence the word "<em>Ha'arev</em>" is recited
            (without a <em>vav</em>) and <em>Amen</em> is to be answered after the first part. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 47:6, writes
that it is preferable to start "<em>V'Ha'arev</em>" with a <em>vav</em> in order to fulfill the obligation according to all opinions. The            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:12 writes that it is the opinion of most <em>Acharonim</em> not to answer <em>Amen</em> at the end of the first part.
            Therefore, it is best to say it quietly in order to avoid uncertainty. Nonetheless, the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em> and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 47:10 and
47:13 write that one should answer <em>Amen</em> after it, even though we say "<em>V'Ha'arev</em>" with a <em>vav</em>, for that is what            <em>Rav Chaim Vital</em> testified in the name of the <em>Ari</em>.

            <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
The source for this is in <em>Berachot</em> 11b where it mentions that the <em>berachah</em> is called "<em>Ahavah Rabbah</em>" according to            <em>Nusach Ashkenaz </em>and "<em>Ahavat Olam</em>" according to <em>Nusach Sephard</em> (following the opinion of <em>rabbanan</em> there).
            Concerning one who forgets to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and arrives at <em>Ahavat Olam</em>, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 52:9 writes that he
            should have in mind to fulfill his obligation when reciting <em>Ahavat Olam</em>. Additionally, see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> s.v. "<em>Poteret</em>
            ," where it seems from <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> that one must have <em>kavanah</em> explicitly in this <em>berachah</em> in order to
            fulfill his obligation. However, according to the <em>Rosh</em>, even without <em>kavanah</em>, one fulfills his obligation <em>b'dieved</em> by
saying it, and that is what is inferred from the <em>Acharonim</em>. They further debate whether one must learn Torah immediately afterwards. The<em>Yerushalmi</em> writes that one is required to learn and that is the opinion of the majority of <em>Rishonim</em>. However, some say (            <em>Tosafot Berachot</em> 11a) that the <em>Bavli</em> disagrees, and therefore, according to them it is unnecessary to learn immediately after its
            recital. Further, they are uncertain as to whether <em>Shema</em> can be considered learning. In order to avoid uncertainty, one must learn
something immediately after praying. (According to most <em>poskim</em>, the recital of <em>Shema</em> is not considered learning; see            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 17 and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> in the name of Rabbi Akiva Eiger.) However, even if a person did not learn, he fulfilled
            his obligation <em>b'dieved </em>(<em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 6; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 17). Additionally, we do learn at the end of the prayer
service, for the recital of <em>U'va L'Tzion</em> was instituted so that every Jew would learn verses from the books of the prophets (<em>Nevi'im</em>) every day, and for that purpose the words were translated, as explained further in this book 23:2. Similarly, we say            <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> and <em>Tanna D'vei Eliyahu</em> for the sake of learning <em>Chazal</em>'s words, as is clarified further in this book
            23:5.

According to the <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Birkat HaMazon</em> is the only blessing that is a biblical commandment, and that is what the<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 209:3, writes. However, most <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> maintain that<em>Birkot HaTorah</em> are also a biblical obligation. Similarly, the <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em> 24 proves this from the fact that the            <em>Gemara</em> wants to learn a principle of<em> kal vachomer</em> from <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and apply it to the <em>berachah</em> before
            eating and a <em>kal vachomer</em> principle cannot be learned from a rabbinic ruling. Nevertheless, concerning a case of uncertainty, although
there are those who rule to recite all the <em>berachot</em>, he writes that one must recite only the "<em>Asher bachar banu</em>"            <em>berachah</em> as it is written in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:1. See <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 47:2 for an expanded list of sources.
            Additionally see <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 47:2 who explains that even according to the <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is biblical, yet
            it is included in the mitzvah of learning Torah and therefore is not listed as its own commandment.

            <a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>
            According to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 47:4, it is only necessary to recite a blessing if the learning is actually said out loud, since that is
            the essence of Torah learning, as it is written (Joshua 1:8), "This book of the Torah shall not depart <strong>from your mouth</strong>. You shall
            meditate thereon day and night." Although in-depth study of certain matters is possible and perhaps even preferable to do via one's thoughts,
            still, at all other times it is necessary to learn by saying the words out loud (<em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em>,<em> Hilchot Talmud Torah</em>
            2:12). In that way, the learning one accomplishes becomes clearer and the abstract ideas he learned via thought are understood better. Further,
            someone who learns out loud remembers his learning better (see <em>Eiruvin</em> 54a). However, the <em>Vilna Gaon </em>(<em>Gra</em>)<em> </em>
            maintains<em> </em>that even though the essence of one's learning should be done out loud, nonetheless, even thinking the words and ideas of the
            Torah is part of the mitzvah, as it says (Joshua 1:8), "You shall meditate thereon day and night," and "meditating" is thinking. Therefore, it is
            necessary to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> prior to mental learning as well. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 6 mentions opinions that someone who is reading
            a book usually will also read with his mouth. Nevertheless, although it is good to take into consideration the opinion of the <em>Gra</em>, one
            must say a few verses aloud after <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in order to adjoin the blessing to the learning. For that reason, it is customary to
            recite the verses of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> after <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:5). One who wakes from his sleep and wants
            to continue lying in his bed can rub his hands on his blanket, recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, say a few verses, and ponder Torah thoughts, as
            explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 4:23 and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> paragraphs 59 and 61. If he wakes up in the middle of his sleep,
I wrote that he may think thoughts of Torah without reciting the <em>berachot</em>, taking into consideration the opinion of the<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>and our custom to bless once a day following <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, as explained further in this chapter in            <em>halachot</em> 6 and 7.

            Further, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 47:3 clarifies that one who writes words of Torah is considered to be learning and must recite a blessing
            prior to doing so. However, there are those who disagree, among them the <em>Taz</em>. In practice, the <em>Acharonim</em> agree that one who wants
to write words of Torah must bless and afterwards recite a few verses, thereby fulfilling his obligation according to all opinions (            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:4; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 5).

            The <em>Rishonim</em> write that <em>Birkot HaMitzvot</em> must be recited while standing. Therefore, the <em>berachah</em> recited on wrapping
            oneself in <em>tzitzit</em>, for example, is recited while standing, as well as the <em>berachah</em> before blowing the <em>shofar</em> or shaking
the <em>lulav</em> (<em>Beit Yosef</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em>, beginning of section 8). Based on this, it would seem to be necessary to recite            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> while standing as well, for these blessings are also included in <em>Birkot HaMitzvot</em>. However, it is the opinion of
            the <em>Pnei Yehoshua</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 21a), that the obligation to stand pertains to <em>mitzvot</em> which are performed while standing,
            such as harvesting the sheaves of grain (for<em> Korban HaOmer</em>) and blowing the <em>shofar</em>, but regarding <em>mitzvot</em> that can be
performed either while standing or sitting, such as Torah learning, one may recite the blessing while sitting. That is what is written in<em>Yechaveh</em> <em>Da'at</em> 5:4. <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> 8:3 adds that according to <em>sod </em>(mysticism), it is correct to recite            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> while standing. All this is <em>lechatchilah</em>; however, obviously one who recites the blessing while sitting fulfills
            his obligation. Even blowing the <em>shofar</em> and counting the <em>Omer</em> may, in extenuating circumstances, be performed while sitting, as
clarified in <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 8:2. In practice, many <em>Ashkenazim</em> follow the custom to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and            <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> while standing or walking, but not while sitting.

The <em>Rishonim</em> disagree concerning the question of whether it is an obligation to learn a few verses of Torah immediately upon reciting<em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. According to<em> Ri</em>, one of the <em>Ba'alei HaTosafot</em> (<em>Berachot</em> 11b, "<em>Shekvar</em>"),            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> differ from the other <em>Birkot HaMitzvot</em> in that they are not directed only towards the present learning, rather
they are designated for Torah learning throughout the entire day. Therefore, there is no obligation to learn specifically after the<em>berachah</em>, rather the obligation is to learn something during the day. That is how the <em>Beit Yosef</em> interprets the opinions of the<em>Rosh</em> and the <em>Tur</em> as well. However, the <em>Rambam</em> maintains that the law concerning <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is like all            <em>Birkot HaMitzvot</em>, in which it is necessary to adjoin the <em>berachah</em> to the mitzvah and therefore one must learn immediately
            following its recital. If he does not learn immediately, the <em>berachah</em> becomes nullified. This case is similar to a person who wants to eat
            cake and recites, "<em>Borei minei</em> <em>mezonot</em>", yet does not eat right away, and instead goes to do other things. When he finally wants
            to eat from the cake, he will need to go back and repeat the <em>Mezonot </em>blessing. Even though it seems from the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> that
the ruling is according to<em> Ri</em>, nonetheless, in the opinion of many <em>Acharonim</em> we follow the <em>Rambam</em> (            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:19), for the <em>Rama</em> in <em>Darkei Moshe</em> explains the opinions of the <em>Rosh</em> and the <em>Tur</em>
like the <em>Rambam</em>. Nowadays, the prevalent <em>minhag</em> among all Jews is to recite the three verses of <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> after<em>Birkot HaTorah</em> and that is considered learning after the <em>berachah</em>. After that, many add other rabbinic words such as "            <em>Eilu devarim</em>...", for they contain words of <em>Mishnah</em> and <em>Beraita</em>, (which are considered words of <em>Gemara</em>), and in
            that way every Jew merits learning Scripture, <em>Mishnah</em>, and <em>Gemara</em> daily.

            The <em>Beit Yosef</em> 47:11 and 13 explains that according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, any regular sleep is considered to be an
            interruption. Yet, he cites <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, <em>Ram</em>, and <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, who maintain that <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>
last until the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer of the next day. Even if he slept a regular sleep, it is not an interruption. In practice, the            <em>Beit Yosef</em> concludes that only regarding regular sleep during the day do we take into consideration the opinions which maintain that it is
            not an interruption. That is what is written in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 47:13. However, regular sleep at night is considered to be an interruption
            and it is necessary to recite the blessings after it. This is what the <em>Pri Chadash</em> 47:13 and many other <em>Acharonim </em>write, as well
            as the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:29, based on the absolute majority of the <em>poskim</em>. That is also what is written in <em>Yabia Omer</em>
            8:5. Some <em>Acharonim</em> suggest compromises, such as reciting all <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> the first time and one <em>berachah</em> the second
            time (<em>Shut Maharsham</em> 3:337). However, according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, one must recite all <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> after
            every regular sleep at night. <strong>What is the definition of regular sleep?</strong> The <em>Rosh</em> writes that sleep is considered regular
            when one goes to sleep on his bed. <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em>,<em> </em>section 4:16 writes that the middle opinion regarding sixty breaths taken
            while sleeping is approximately half an hour. See the note in <em>Yabia Omer</em> there.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Moreover, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:25 writes that one who recites <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> after a regular sleep during the day does not lose
            out, because that is the opinion of the absolute majority of the <em>poskim</em>. (Additionally, according to most <em>poskim</em>, the obligation
            to recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is biblical, and <em>sefeika d'oraita l'chumra</em>, when there is doubt concerning a biblical commandment, we
are stringent.) Even so, the accepted <em>minhag</em> is not to recite the <em>berachot</em>. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 25 writes in the name of the            <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Vayeshev</em> 12, that in order to avoid uncertainty it is best to recite the <em>berachot</em> in his thoughts. He
            further advises that while saying <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in the morning one should have <em>kavanah</em> explicitly that they continue to last
            after sleep, for perhaps such <em>kavanah</em> will be effective. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13 suggests having <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill the
            obligation of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> in the recital of <em>Ahavat Olam</em> in <em>Ma'ariv</em>, and after the <em>berachah</em> to say a verse
            for the sake of learning, for we learned in halachah 2 that <em>Ahavat Olam</em> is considered to be like <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <strong>The opinion of the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em></strong>
,<strong><em> </em></strong><em>Vayeshev</em> 13, also cited by the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 47:29, is that, according to Kabbalah, the law of            <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> is similar to the law of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, that they are not recited twice in a 24-hour period. Their opinion is
based on <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>. However, according to <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> are recited in the morning adjacent to            <em>Shacharit</em>, and according to the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, if one slept twice at night, he recites the blessings after the first sleep and not
            after the second (and he should have <em>kavanah</em> in <em>Ahavat Olam</em> to fulfill the obligation of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>). According to
            this, there is a certain distinction between <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> and <em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> has two intentions:
            one, as part of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> whose time starts after <em>chatzot</em>, and the second, as <em>berachot</em> before learning Torah.
Therefore, one who wakes up close to <em>chatzot</em> should wait and recite <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> with <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> after            <em>chatzot</em>. Yet, if he wakes up long before <em>chatzot</em>, he may recite them before <em>chatzot </em>alone. There were devout people who
            were accustomed even in such a case to wait and recite the blessings after <em>chatzot</em>.

            <a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title="">[8]</a>
This is the Sephardic<em> minhag</em>, based on <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>. One who was awake all night must be careful not to recite<em>Birkot HaTorah</em> before <em>amud hashachar</em>. <em>Shut HaElef Lecha Shlomo </em>33 writes that if he recited them before<em>amud hashachar</em> his <em>berachah</em> is in vain and it must be repeated after <em>amud hashachar</em>. That is also what is written in            <em>Kaf Hachaim </em>47:29. The <em>Tzlach </em>in <em>Berachot</em> 11b is uncertain of this, and therefore the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 47:9 writes
that if he recites the <em>berachah</em> before <em>amud hashachar</em>, he should have <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation in            <em>Ahavat Olam</em>. (According to the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, those who are awake all night should recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> immediately
            after <em>chatzot</em> and only delay the recital of <em>Birkot HaTorah</em> until after <em>amud hashachar</em>.)
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Concerning the Ashkenazic custom, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes that if one is not in the vicinity of someone whom he can hear recite<em>Birkot HaTorah</em>, he can have <em>kavanah</em> to fulfill his obligation in <em>Ahavah Rabbah.</em> That is based on the<em>Chayei Adam</em> in the name of <em>Pri Chadash</em> and the <em>Gra.</em> It is also the prevalent <em>minhag</em>. However, according to the            <em>Magen Avraham</em>, <em>Derech HaChaim</em>, <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, and <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 7, he should recite the blessings
himself. That is what is written in <em>Olat Ra'ayah</em> p. 59, as well. The reason for this is because the obligation to recite the            <em>berachot</em> is biblical and <em>sefeika d'oriata l'chumra</em>, (when there is doubt concerning biblical obligations, we are stringent).
            Obviously, one who wishes to rely on them is permitted to do so.

So writes <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 47:28, according to Rabbi Akiva Eiger, that in this case, all <em>poskim</em> agree that one must recite<em>Birkot HaTorah</em>. According to the <em>Rosh</em>, this is because after a regular sleep during the day he is obligated to recite the            <em>berachot</em>, and according to <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em>, because the new day has arrived.
