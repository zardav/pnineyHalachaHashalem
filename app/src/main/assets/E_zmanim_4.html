<a name="1"></a><h2>4.1 – The Mitzvah of Settling the Land of Israel </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
When the State of Israel was established, on the fifth of Iyar, 5708, the Jewish people were privileged [once again to be able] to fulfill the    <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv Eretz Yisrael</em> (Settling the Land of Israel). Even before the declaration of statehood, every Jew who lived in the Land
    fulfilled this <em>mitzvah</em>. The Sages even said, “A person should always dwell in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>, even in a city inhabited mostly by heathens,
    and he should not dwell outside the Land, even in a city inhabited mostly by Jews, for anyone who dwells in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> is like one who has a
God, and anyone who dwells outside the Land is like one who has no God” (<em>Ketuvot</em> 110b). Nonetheless, the <em>mitzvah</em> is mainly incumbent upon    <em>Klal Yisrael</em> (the Jewish Collective) – to take control of the Land. The <em>mitzvah</em> to dwell in the Land, which applies to every individual
    Jew, is an offshoot of the general <em>mitzvah</em> that is incumbent upon <em>Klal Yisrael</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This is the meaning of the verse <em>You shall possess the Land and dwell in it, for to you have I given the Land to possess it</em> (<em>BeMidbar</em>
    33:53). “<em>You shall possess</em>” denotes conquest and sovereignty, while “<em>You shall dwell</em>” implies settling the Land so that it not be
    desolate. Similarly, the Torah states, <em>You shall possess it and you shall dwell therein</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 11:31). Accordingly, the Ramban defines
    the <em>mitzvah</em> as follows: “We were commanded to take possession of the Land that God, may He be blessed, gave to our forefathers, Avraham, Yitzchak,
    and Ya’akov; and we must not leave it in the hands of any other nation or [let it remain] desolate” (Addendum to Rambam’s <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>,
    Positive Commandment 4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This <em>mitzvah</em> is incumbent upon the Jewish people in every generation. For a long time, however, we lacked the means by which to fulfill it. We
    were forced [to neglect it], because we did not have an army or weapons with which to conquer and settle the Land. A few generations ago, God showed
    kindness to His nation and a spirit of nationalism began to stir, causing Jews to go forth and gather in the Land. They planted trees, developed the
    country’s economy, established an organized defense force, and struggled against the foreign power that controlled the Land, so that when the British
Mandate expired, our representatives were able to declare the establishment of the State of Israel. On that day, the Jewish people began fulfilling the    <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>. Granted, we are not yet in control of the entire Land, and we are partially dependent on the nations of the
    world, but we are actually fulfilling, once again, the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We find in <em>halachah</em>, as well, [that Jewish sovereignty over the Land is significant], for the laws of mourning over <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>’s
destruction depend on sovereignty. Our Sages prescribed that one who sees the cities of Judea in ruins should say,    <em>Your holy cities have become a wilderness</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 64:9) and tear his garments. The <em>poskim</em> explain that the definition of “in
    ruins” depends on who is in control. If Gentiles rule the Land, its cities are considered ruined, even if most of the inhabitants are Jewish, and one must
    tear his garment upon seeing them. But if the Jews are in control, the cities are not considered ruined, even if Gentiles constitute the majority, and no
    tearing is required (<em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Bach</em> <em>O.C.</em> 561; <em>M.A.</em> 1 and <em>M.B.</em> 2).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
[Besides all this], <em>Chazal</em> lavish praise upon the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>, going so far as to say that it is equal to all the    <em>mitzvot</em> [of the Torah] (<em>Sifrei</em>, <em>Re’eh</em> 53).

<a name="2"></a><h2>4.2 – The Beginning of Redemption and Sanctifying God’s Name </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The establishment of the State removed the disgrace of exile [from the Jewish people]. Generation after generation, we wandered in exile, suffering
    dreadful humiliation, pillage, and bloodshed. We were an object of scorn and derision among the nations; we were regarded as sheep led to the slaughter, to
be killed, destroyed, beaten, and humiliated. Strangers said to us, “There is no more hope or expectation for you.” That situation was a terrible    <em>Chillul HaShem</em> (desecration of God’s name), because <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>’s name is associated with us, and when we are degraded, His name
    is desecrated among the nations (see <em>Yechezkel</em> 36).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The prophets of Israel prophesied, in God’s name, [that the exile will eventually end]:<em>I will take you from among the nations and gather you from all the lands, and I will bring you to your own soil</em> (<em>Yechezkel</em> 36:24).<em>They will build houses and inhabit them; they will plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 65:21).    <em>You will yet plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters with plant and eat of [the fruit]</em> (<em>Yirmiyah</em> 31:4).
    <em>
        The desolate Land will be tilled, instead of having been desolate in the eyes of all passersby. They will say, “This Land [which was] desolate has
        become like the Garden of Eden and the cities [which were] ruined, desolate, and destroyed have been fortified and inhabited”
    </em>
    (<em>Yechezkel</em> 36:34-35).
    <em>
        I will return the captivity of My people Israel, and they will rebuild the destroyed cities and inhabit [them]; they will plant vineyards and drink
        their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruits. I will plant them upon their Land and they will never again be uprooted from their Land that I
        have given them, says the Lord, your God
    </em>
    (<em>Amos</em> 9:14-15).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, after so many years passed without God’s word coming to fruition, HaShem’s name became increasingly desecrated in the world, and the enemies of
    Israel decided that there is no chance that the Jews will ever return to their Land. Even <em>Chazal</em> spoke exaggeratingly about the miracle of the
    ingathering of the exiles, to the point that they said, “The ingathering of the exiles is as great as the day upon which the heaven and earth were created”
    (<em>Pesachim</em> 88a). And behold, the miracle occurred! HaShem fulfilled His promise, causing an enormous and awesome <em>Kiddush HaShem</em>
    (sanctification of God’s name), which gained even more strength during the Six Day War, when we liberated Jerusalem and the holy cities of Judea and
    Samaria.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This process – the ingathering of the exiles and the blooming of the wasteland – which gained tremendous momentum when the State was established, is the
beginning of the redemption, as Rebbi Abba says (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 98a), “There is no clearer [sing of the] End [of Days] than this [verse]:<em>But you, O mountains of Israel, will give forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are soon to come</em> (    <em>Yechezkel</em> 36:8).” Rashi comments, “When <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> gives forth its fruit in abundance, the End will be near, and there is no clearer
    [sign of the] End [of Days].”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
True, many things still need fixing – unfortunately, we have not been privileged to repent fully, and many Jews have yet to immigrate to    <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> – but our Sages have taught that [redemption can come in one of two ways]: if we achieve complete repentance, God will hasten the
    redemption, and if not, it will come “in its time,” through natural processes (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 98a). That is, when the predetermined time for redemption
    arrives – even if Israel fails to repent – natural processes, loaded with complications and severe hardships, will begin to unfold, causing the Jewish
    people to return to their Land and rebuild it. We will proceed from stage to stage in this manner, until the ultimate redemption materializes. These
hardships, which stimulate the redemptive process, are called the birth pangs of <em>Mashiach</em>. The more we strengthen ourselves in the areas of    <em>Yishuv Eretz Yisrael</em> and penitence, the sweeter and more pleasant these birth pangs will become (based on the Gra in <em>Kol HaTor</em>).
    Concerning this type of redemption, <em>Chazal</em> say, “Such is the redemption of Israel: at first little by little, but as it progresses it grows
    greater and greater” (<em>Yerushalmi</em>, <em>Berachot</em> 1:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Explicit verses in the Torah and the Prophets indicate that the order of redemption is as follows: First, there will be a small degree of repentance and
    the Jewish people will gather in their Land, which will begin to yield its fruit. Afterwards, HaShem will bestow upon us a spirit from on high, until we
    return to Him completely.

<a name="3"></a><h2>4.3 – Salvation of Israel</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    On <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> (Israeli Independence Day), the Jewish people were delivered from bondage to freedom – from subjugation to the kingdoms of the
    world, with all that that entails, to political independence. This also brought about an actual salvation from death to life. Until then, we were unable to
    defend ourselves against our enemies who pursued us. From that day on, thanks to God’s kindness, we defend ourselves and win [our battles]. True, all the
    enemies who rise up to destroy us have yet to be destroyed, but after the establishment of the State we formed an army, thank God, and we have the strength
    to fight back and even win. And even though more than 20,000 holy souls have been killed in wars and terror attacks since the State came into being over
    sixty years ago, just a few years beforehand, during the horrific Holocaust, more than six million holy Jews were killed in the span of five years – more
    than three hundred times the amount. This is the difference between having the ability to fight back and not having that ability.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    That day brought about a salvation for Diaspora Jews, as well. They now have a country that is always willing to absorb them, one that even works on their
    behalf in the international arena. Before the State was established, almost no one paid attention to the Jews’ complaints against the murderous,
    anti-Semitic persecutions that raged in many countries. After Israel gained independence, however, even the most evil regimes were forced to take into
    consideration Israel’s actions on behalf of the Jews living in their midst. Even Communist Russia had to relent and allow the Jews to leave from behind the
    Iron Curtain, something that was unfathomable before the State was born.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The establishment of the State also brought spiritual salvation to the Jews. The Jewish nation underwent a profound spiritual crisis in the modern era. The
    opportunity to integrate into the civil and national frameworks of the developed nations, which the Jews now enjoyed, generated a strong desire to
    assimilate. This is not the place to elaborate on the reasons for this crisis; our master, Rav Kook <em>zt”l</em> deals with the issue at length,
    discussing its various facets. Practically speaking, a dangerous process of assimilation and the abandonment of religion developed in all countries that
    embraced modernization. This process threatened the very existence of the Jewish communities in the Diaspora. Assimilation began approximately two hundred
    years ago in Western Europe, spreading gradually to Eastern Europe and the capitals of the more developed Arab countries. Most youth in the greater Jewish
    community of America marry out of the faith, and even those who marry Jews beget very few offspring. Under these circumstances, Diaspora Jewry is fading
    away. Only in the State of Israel is the Jewish population growing; and intermarriage is relatively rare. Moreover, the percentage of Jews connected to
    Torah and <em>mitzvot</em> in Israel is higher than that of any other Jewish community in the world. This spiritual salvation came about in the merit of
    the establishment of the State, which enabled the ingathering of the exiles and diminished the temptation of assimilation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Thus, <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> is invested with three sanctities: the <em>mitzvah</em> of settling the Land, the beginning of redemption which created a    <em>Kiddush HaShem</em> in the eyes of the nations, and the [various] salvations that the holy Jewish people enjoyed.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>4.4 – The Three Oaths</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The verse says,    <em>I made you swear, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, that you not awaken nor arouse the love until it desires</em>
    (<em>Shir HaShirim</em> 2:7). The Sages explain that God administered three oaths: two to Israel and one to the Gentiles. [He adjured Israel] not to ascend
“as a wall” (some versions read, “against the wall”) and not to rebel against the nations, while [adjuring the Gentiles] not to overly subjugate the Jews (    <em>Ketuvot</em> 111a). Afterwards, the <em>Gemara</em> adds three other oaths that HaShem administered to the Jews: “That they will not reveal the End [of
    Days], delay the End, or reveal the secret to the Gentiles.” Furthermore, “R. Elazar says, ‘The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “If you fulfill
    the oath, fine; but if not, I will allow your flesh [to be devoured] like that of the gazelles and the hinds of the field.” ’ ”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One of the <em>Rishonim</em>, Rabbi Yitzchak De Leon, author of <em>Megillat Esther</em> [on the Rambam’s <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>], understands the oaths
    to mean that “we may not rebel against the nations and conquer the Land forcibly,” and this is the intention of “not to ascend as a wall.” Based on this,
he concludes that there is no <em>mitzvah</em> to settle the Land until <em>Mashiach</em> arrives (Gloss on the Ramban’s Addendum to    <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>, Positive Commandment 4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, the greatest <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em> hold that the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em> is fixed and eternal, as the
    Ramban, <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>E.H.E.</em> 75:3-5), and <em>Pitchei Teshuvah</em> (ibid. 75:6) determine. Thus, one should not learn from this
    aggadic statement that the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em> no longer applies nowadays.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many interpretations have been given for the three oaths. Several of them imply that we must not precipitate the End [of Days] and ascend to the Land
    forcibly, without first considering the matter realistically. For there is reason to fear that, because of the hardships of exile and the protracted
    anticipation for redemption, people will ascend to the Land impetuously, without any practical means by which to build the Land and stand up against the
    nations of the world. This will lead to destruction and crisis instead of the beginning of redemption. Therefore, God made us swear that we will not
    [attempt to return] before carefully calculating our actions. Rather, we should ascend and build the Land gradually, in coordination with the nations of
    the world, or by way of manifest miracles, if [we deserve] the “I [God] will hasten it (<em>Yeshayah</em> 60:22)” form of redemption.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Indeed, the [modern] return to Zion occurred gradually. The Jewish community in the Land established itself step by step, while the Zionist Organization
    simultaneously engaged in diplomatic efforts, until the nations recognized the Jewish people’s right to return to their Land and build there a national
home. Accordingly, after the [League of] Nations agreed, in San Remo, [to return the Land of Israel to the Jewish people], Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk    <em>zt”l</em> wrote that “the fear of the oaths has faded away.”

</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>4.5 – Establishing Yom HaAtzma’ut as a Lasting Holiday </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is a <em>mitzvah</em> to establish a holiday, to rejoice and praise God, on a day the Jews were delivered from distress. This is what prompted [the
    Rabbis] to establish Purim and Chanukah as everlasting holidays. Even though it is forbidden to add <em>mitzvot</em> onto the Torah, this <em>mitzvah</em>
    is [an exception, for it is] derived from a logical inference (a <em>kal va’chomer</em>): When we left Egypt and were delivered from slavery to freedom,
    God commanded us to celebrate <em>Pesach</em> and sing praise [to Him] every year; all the more so [must we celebrate] Purim, when we were saved from death
to life (<em>Megillah</em> 14a). This is what the Rabbis relied on when establishing Chanukah, as well (Ritva, ibid.). The Chatam Sofer explains (    <em>Y.D.</em> end of 233, <em>O.C.</em> 208) that since this <em>mitzvah</em> is derived from a <em>kal va’chomer</em>, it is considered a biblical
    commandment. However, the Torah does not prescribe exactly how to make a holiday; therefore, one who does anything to commemorate the salvation fulfills
    his biblical obligation. It was the Rabbis who determined that we read the <em>Megillah</em>, prepare a festive meal, send portions of food to others, and
    give charity to the poor on Purim, and light the candles on Chanukah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many Jewish communities [throughout the ages] kept this <em>mitzvah</em>, instituting days of joy in commemoration of miracles that happened to them. Many
    of them used the name Purim in reference to these days, like “Frankfort Purim” and “Tiberias Purim.” Some communities had a custom to eat festive meals,
    send portions of food to one another, and give alms to the poor on these days. Maharam Alshakar (49) writes that the enactments made by these communities
have binding force, obligating all of their descendants to keep them, even if they move to a new community. Other <em>Acharonim</em> concur (    <em>Magen Avraham</em> and <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> 686:5).
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The great <em>gaon</em>, R. Meshulam Roth (Rata), writes: “There is no doubt that we are commanded to rejoice, establish a holiday, and say <em>Hallel</em>
    on [the fifth of Iyar], the day which the government, the members of the Knesset (who were chosen by the majority of the people), and most of the greatest
    rabbis fixed as the day on which to celebrate, throughout the Land, the miracle of our salvation and freedom” (<em>Responsa Kol Mevaser</em> 1:21).
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>4.6 – The Recitation of Hallel </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is a <em>mitzvah</em> to say <em>Hallel</em> on special occasions, in order to thank and praise HaShem for the miracles He performs on our behalf. First
    and foremost are the holidays that the Torah commands us [to observe]: <em>Pesach</em>, <em>Shavu’ot</em>, and <em>Sukkot</em>, on which we remember the
miracles and acts of kindness that God did for us when He took us out of Egypt, gave us the Torah, and brought us through the desert to    <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Our Sages also instituted the recitation of <em>Hallel</em> on all eight days of Chanukah, as the <em>beraita</em> states (<em>Megillat Ta’anit</em>, chap.
9): “Why did they see fit to [require us to recite the] complete <em>Hallel</em> on these days? To teach us that for every salvation    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> performs for Israel, they [the Jews] come before Him in song and praise. Accordingly, it says in the Book of <em>Ezra</em>
    (3:11), <em>They sang responsively with praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, for He is good…</em>”
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly, the Talmud (<em>Pesachim</em> 117a) states that after the miracle of the splitting of the Red Sea, “the prophets among them instituted that the
    Jews should recite <em>Hallel</em> for each and every season [i.e., festival] and each and every trouble that should ‘not’ come upon them; [meaning], when
    they are redeemed they should say it upon their redemption.” Rashi explains that the Sages of the Second Temple era relied on this to institute the
    recitation of <em>Hallel</em> on Chanukah.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Thus, it is incumbent upon us to say <em>Hallel</em> over the miracle that HaShem did for us on <em>Yom HaAtma’ut</em>. On that day we were saved from the
    greatest trouble of all, that of exile and subjugation to foreigners, which caused all of the terrible decrees and massacres that [we suffered] for
    [nearly] two thousand years.
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We must be very careful not to deny God’s benevolence. The Sages say, “Whoever acknowledges his miracle will be privileged to have another miracle done for
    him.”<sup>*</sup> On the other hand, if we fail to thank HaShem, we will delay the redemption, God forbid, as [the Talmud] relates regarding King
    Chizkiyahu. He was a very righteous man who spread a great deal of Torah throughout Israel, but difficult times eventually beset him. Sancheriv, King of
    Assyria, descended upon Jerusalem with a mighty army, intending to destroy it, and Chizkiyahu fell deathly ill. Nevertheless, he did not lose faith;
    instead, he cried out to God, Who performed a great miracle on his behalf, curing his illness and destroying Sancheriv’s entire army in one night. At that
    moment, God wanted to declare Chizkiyahu as the Messiah and make [the war against] Sancheriv into [the final war of] Gog u’Magog, and bring redemption to
    the world. But Chizkiyahu did not say <em>shirah</em> [song] – i.e., <em>Hallel</em> – over his redemption. The [heavenly] Attribute of Justice said to
    God, “Master of the Universe, if You did not make David, King of Israel, the Messiah, even though he uttered so many songs and praises before You, will You
    make Chizkiyahu the Messiah, seeing that he failed to say <em>shirah</em> after You performed all of these miracles for him? Therefore, the matter was
    sealed,” and there was great sorrow in all the worlds. The earth wanted to say <em>shirah</em> in his stead, and the “minister of the world” wanted to
    defend him, but their pleas were rejected; the opportunity was lost. The prophet said, “Woe to me! Woe to me! Until when?” (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 94a)
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The same is true of us. For many generations we prayed, “Raise a banner to gather our exiles” and “Swiftly, lead us upright to our Land.” Now that our
prayers have been answered, shall we not thank HaShem?! Similarly, it says,    <em>Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may thank Your holy name, [and] glory in Your praise</em> (<em>Tehillim</em>
    106:47). Now that He has gathered us, shall we not thank His holy name and glorify His praise?!
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>4.7 – Hallel With or Without a Blessing? </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some say that even though we should thank HaShem on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>, we should not say <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing. They mention five main
    reasons: 1) Based on several <em>Rishonim</em>, the Chida holds that <em>Hallel</em> is said with a blessing only when all of Israel experiences a miracle;
    and when we declared independence only a minority of world Jewry lived in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>. 2) We should give thanks only for a complete salvation;
    and our enemies still threaten us on all sides. 3) The spiritual state of the country’s leaders and many of its citizens [diminishes our joy]. 4) It is
    proper to show deference to the opinion that holds that <em>Hallel</em> should be said only when a revealed miracle occurs, like the oil-flask miracle; the
establishment of the State was a natural miracle. 5) It is unclear whether the day of thanksgiving should be set for the day we declared independence [5    <sup>th</sup> of Iyar], the day the War of Independence ended, or the day the United Nations decided to establish a Jewish State, which was the sixteenth
    of Kislev (Nov. 29).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Because of all, or some, of these concerns, the Chief Rabbinate’s Council originally prescribed that one recite the <em>Hallel</em> without a blessing
    during the morning prayers of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. Over the course of the next twenty-six years, however, [the State of Israel’s situation improved
    dramatically]. We were privileged to liberate Judea and Samaria [in the Six-Day War], and we even came out of the Yom Kippur War with a great victory,
    despite the adverse conditions at the start. More than three million Jews already lived in the Land, five times the number that lived there at the State’s
    inception [1948]. Therefore, on the 25<sup>th</sup> of Nissan, 5734 (1974), the Chief Rabbinate’s Council assembled once again – at the initiative of the
    [Ashkenazi] Chief Rabbi, R. Shlomo Goren <em>zt”l</em> – to discuss the issue of <em>Hallel</em> on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. They decided, by majority
    vote, that a strong case can be made in favor of saying the full <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> morning. On this basis, our
    master and teacher, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook <em>zt”l</em> instructed the Merkaz HaRav yeshiva to recite <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing, and all of
    his students act accordingly.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In response to the claim that <em>Hallel</em> may be said only on a miracle that affects all of Israel, [the rabbis] explained that the establishment of
    the State constituted a salvation for all of Israel (as explained above, sec. 3). In addition, the residents of the Land of Israel are considered the
    entirety of Israel (<em>Klal Yisrael</em>). The Day of Independence was specifically chosen as the day of thanksgiving because it was the foundation for
    the deliverance and salvation.

</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>4.8 – SheHechiyanu and Hallel at Night</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>gaon</em> R. Meshulam Roth, since <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> is a holiday, commemorating the salvation that Israel experienced on that
    day, it is appropriate to recite the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing on the day, as we do on all the holidays, including Purim and Chanukah. He believes,
    however, that the obligation to say <em>SheHechiyanu</em> depends on one’s joy. Therefore, one who is not particularly happy <em>may</em> recite the
    blessing but is not obligated to do so, while one who enjoys and is happy about the establishment of the State is obligated to recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em>
    on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Many others hold that one should not say <em>SheHechiyanu</em> on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>, because the Sages instituted the recitation of this blessing
only for holidays on which one is forbidden to do work, like the three pilgrimage festivals, <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>, and <em>Yom Kippur</em>. The    <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing that we say on Chanukah and Purim, which do not entail a prohibition against work, pertains to the special <em>mitzvot</em>
    we perform on these days – the <em>Megillah</em> reading on Purim and the candle lighting on Chanukah – not to the very essence of the day. For, one does
    not recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em> over the essence of a holiday unless it is forbidden to do work on that day.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    One who wants to be meticulous and satisfy all opinions should wear a new garment and recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em> on it, having in mind that the blessing
    relates to the holiday, as well. If he is the <em>chazzan</em> (prayer leader), it is best to say the blessing on the garment right before <em>Hallel</em>.
    This way, the listeners can also discharge their obligation.
    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button>
</p>

    Some say that the salvation of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> is similar to the exodus from Egypt, requiring us to say <em>Hallel</em> at night. This was Rabbi
    Goren’s custom, and some communities follow this practice. However, many [authorities] hold that the <em>halachah</em> of saying <em>Hallel</em> on the
    night of <em>Pesach</em> is unique, and we cannot deduce other holidays from it. The proof being that we say <em>Hallel</em> on the other holidays during
    the day alone. Therefore, one should not say <em>Hallel</em> on the night of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. This is the practice of most of R. Tzvi Yehudah
    HaKohen Kook’s students.

<a name="9"></a><h2>4.9 – Most Years Yom HaAtzma’ut is Displaced </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The fifth of Iyar can fall out on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday (<em>Shabbat</em>). When it falls out on a Friday or <em>Shabbat</em>, there is
    good reason to fear that the celebrations and ceremonies will cause public desecration of the Sabbath. Therefore, it was decided – at the request of the
    Chief Rabbinate – that whenever <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> falls out on a Friday or <em>Shabbat</em>, the holiday is celebrated on [the previous] Thursday
    (the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> of Iyar). Eventually, [the rabbis] realized that even when <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> falls out on a Monday, the
    preparations for <em>Yom HaZikaron</em> (Memorial Day), which begins on Saturday night, cause many Jews to violate the Sabbath. Therefore, it was decided –
    at the request of the Chief Rabbinate – that [both of these special occasions] be postponed by a day, establishing <em>Yom HaZikaron</em> on the fifth of
    Iyar and <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> on the sixth of the month. In practice, then, on three of the four days on which <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> can fall, we
    celebrate it either before or after [its genuine date].
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We find [a similar concept elsewhere]. Out of concern that one might carry a <em>shofar</em> or <em>lulav</em> on <em>Shabbat</em>, the Sages canceled
    these <em>mitzvot</em>. Therefore, when <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> falls out on <em>Shabbat</em>, we do not blow the <em>shofar</em> that day, and when the
    first day of <em>Sukkot</em> falls out on <em>Shabbat</em>, we do not take the [Four Species]. Thus, the Sages canceled biblical commandments in order to
    avoid Sabbath violation, but we may not change the actual date [of a holiday] since it is [written explicitly] in the Torah. Rabbinically ordained
    holidays, however, may be postponed or observed earlier. [For example], when Purim falls out on <em>Shabbat</em>, we read the <em>Megillah</em> and give
    gifts to the poor on Friday, read the special Torah reading and say <em>Al HaNissim</em> on <em>Shabbat</em>, and eat a festive meal and send portions of
    food [to others] on Sunday (<em>Sh.A. O.C.</em> 688:6, <em>M.B.</em> 18; below 17.5). And when <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> falls on <em>Shabbat</em>, we postpone
    the fast until Sunday (see <em>Sh.A. O.C.</em> 551:4, 554:19).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The same is true of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>; it all depends on how [the holiday] was instituted. Whichever day the representatives of the people and the
    Chief Rabbinate decide is the day to celebrate the establishment of the State is the day that we must thank HaShem for His salvation.

    It is interesting to note that the declaration of independence took place earlier than originally planned, in order to prevent Sabbath desecration. After
    all, the British Mandate ended on Friday night, [May 14, 1948], at midnight, but the heads of the People’s Council did not want to declare statehood amidst
    Sabbath desecration, so they moved the declaration up to Friday afternoon, the fifth of Iyar.

<a name="10"></a><h2>4.10 – Yom Yerushalayim</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In the Six Day War, the Jewish nation, with God’s help, achieved a tremendous victory over its enemies. The war began on three fronts, and in the span of
    [just] six days, we utterly shattered our enemies’ military strength and dealt them a total defeat. At the same time, we liberated all of the holy places
    in Judea and Samaria – most significantly Jerusalem and the Temple Mount – along with the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan. Anyone who viewed these events
honestly, and had even the slightest spark of faith in his heart, saw clearly the words of our holy Torah,    <em>For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp to save you and to deliver your enemies before you</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 23:15). This great
    victory was truly a manifest miracle.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In order to thank HaShem and publicize the miracle, the Chief Rabbinate – headed by R. Isser Yehudah Unterman and R. Yitzchak Nissim – established the
    twenty-eighth of Iyar, the day on which Old Jerusalem and the Temple Mount were liberated, as a day of thanksgiving and joy for all of Israel. They also
    instituted the recitation of <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing after the morning services (<em>Shacharit</em>). R. [Shlomo Yosef] Zevin and R. [Sha’ul]
    Yisraeli also participated in and supported this decision.

</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>4.11 – Shaving, Haircuts, Weddings, and Tachanun </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
After <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> was established as a day of joy and thanksgiving, the question arose: do the customs of mourning that we observe during the    <em>Sefirat HaOmer</em> period apply to <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>? [The halachic authorities] have expressed their opinions in both directions. The accepted
    practice is not to keep those customs that subvert the joy. Therefore, it is permissible to dance and play music. However, one should not make a wedding
    [on that day], because avoiding weddings is not considered an expression of mourning that clashes with the joy of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Those who shave regularly should shave in advance of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>, just like one puts on special clothing before the holiday begins. Regarding
    haircuts, it seems that only one who looks disgraceful because of his [long] hair may take a haircut prior to <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. Someone who looks
    fine, however, is allowed to take a haircut only on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> itself, for then the joy [of the day] overrides this custom of mourning.
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Chief Rabbinate, under the leadership of R. Unterman and R. Nissim, determined that even Ashkenazim who observe the customs of mourning [during the
    latter part of <em>Sefirah</em>] should not curtail [their joy] on the 28<sup>th</sup> of Iyar, <em>Yom Yerushalayim</em>. After all, many communities
terminate all the restrictions after <em>Lag BaOmer</em> (the 33<sup>rd</sup> day of the Omer) (see above 3.2-4). All the more so, now that the 28    <sup>th</sup> of Iyar has been instituted as a day of thanksgiving and joy over the miracle that <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> performed for His nation,
    Israel. Therefore, one may even make a wedding on <em>Yom Yerushalayim</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
We do not say <em>Tachanun</em> on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>, <em>Yom Yerushalayim</em>, or the <em>Minchah</em> service preceding these days (    <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 21.7; see also 21.2, n. 1).
</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>4.12 – Yom HaZikaron (Memorial Day) for the Fallen Soldiers of Tzahal (IDF) </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    From a halachic standpoint, there is no need to institute a general memorial day for the holy soldiers who were killed in battle. Rather, one should do
    what the Jewish people do for anyone who has passed away: on the anniversary of death (<em>yahrtzeit</em>), a [short] memorial prayer is said and the
    deceased’s sons or relatives say <em>Kaddish</em>, study Torah, and give charity to elevate [their loved one’s] soul. Those who are more meticulous hold a
    [full] memorial service and organize Torah lectures to elevate the deceased’s soul.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    We have fought many wars throughout our long history, often losing more soldiers in one war than <em>Tzahal</em> has lost in all of its battles put
    together. Nevertheless, we do not find that our Sages ever instituted a memorial day for those killed in battle. When we won, we celebrated, and when we
lost, we mourned individually. The only [tragedy] for which [the Sages] instituted [public mourning, in the form of] fast days, is the destruction (    <em>churban</em>) of the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em>, which was a spiritual and national catastrophe for the Jews. Indeed, the <em>Churban</em> is the source
    of all the troubles, evil decrees, and bloodshed that our nation has suffered throughout the exile. Even the Fast of Gedalyah was instituted [in
    commemoration of the <em>Churban</em>], not because Gedalyah was such a great <em>tzaddik</em> that all of Israel needs to mourn his death. Rather, his
    assassination quelled the last ember [of hope] for the Jews who remained in the Land after the destruction of the First Temple.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Moreover, just a few years before the State of Israel was born, six million Jews were murdered in a dreadfully cruel manner. They are our brothers no less
    than the soldiers who fell in battle, and they are far greater in number, more than three hundred times the number of soldiers who have died in all of
    Israel’s wars. How, then, can we establish a day of mourning for the soldiers on the same scale as for the six million?
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Rather, if there is any allowance for a memorial day, it is on condition that we dedicate the day to educating the public about the essence and purpose of
    the Jewish nation and about the value of self-sacrifice for <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. Many people mistakenly believe that the more we bow our heads in grief
    and portray our pain over the fallen soldiers in somber hues, the more we honor their memories. The opposite, however, is true. We should view the slain as
holy souls, whose entire lives were refined and sanctified through their self-sacrifice for the people and land [of Israel]. About such people    <em>Chazal</em> say, “No one can dwell in the section of <em>Gan Eden</em> where those who were killed by the kingdom dwell” (<em>Pesachim</em> 50a). A
    nonbeliever thinks that they are more dead [than those who are currently alive], but a believing Jew knows that they are more alive than all the rest. They
    died young in this world, but they are very alive in the everlasting world, the World to Come. They are much more alive than we are. They are holy, and our
    Sages say, “What is holy exists forever” (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 92a).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
By dying in sanctification of God’s name, they rose above the personal existence of an individual Jew to the comprehensive level of the holiness of    <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. By sacrificing their lives for <em>Klal Yisrael</em>, they were elevated to the stature of <em>Klal Yisrael</em>, and they are more
    connected to <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, the source of life. Therefore, they added much life in both the World of Truth and this world when they died.
    Moreover, we live here today in their merit, and all of our accomplishments belong to them.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Sadly, people with little faith, who do not understand <em>Klal Yisrael</em>’s past and mission, have seized control of the State of Israel’s media and
    cultural life. In the beginning, [the secularists] still had an inkling of [what] Judaism [was all about], based on what they heard in their parents’ home,
    but over time, alienation [from Torah values] took its toll and they turned <em>Yom HaZikaron</em> into a day of weakness and defeatism. Instead of
    honoring the memories of the fallen, trying to understand the essence of <em>Am Yisrael</em>, and investing meaning into the soldiers’ self-sacrifice, they
    emphasize the pain, despair, and destruction, portraying the deaths of these soldiers as meaningless. They appear to be honoring the fallen, but in
reality, there is no greater affront to the honor of these holy souls than the inappropriate character that these people have attached to    <em>Yom HaZikaron</em>. The fundamental [flaw] being a disregard for the Jewish national destiny for whose sake the soldiers sacrificed their lives.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    If we nonetheless observe <em>Yom HaZikaron</em>, we must underscore the soldiers’ self-sacrifice in sanctification of God’s name. We must emphasize how
    they demonstrated to us that the prophecy of the ingathering of the exiles and the rebirth of the Jewish nation in its [ancient] Homeland is so great that
    it is worthwhile to give up one’s life in this world for its sake. This will strengthen us and inspire us to follow their lead. The children we bear and
    raise exist in their merit; the settlements we establish [flourish] because of them; the Torah we learn is theirs; the ethical Jewish society we want to
    build here, as the prophets foretold, is theirs. If we remember this, and exert a great deal of effort, we will be able to continue in their path, the path
    of self-sacrifice for <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. Then we will truly honor them, as holy and pure souls, illuminating and shining like the glow of the heavens.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    This is also what we must say to the bereaved families in whose midst these holy warriors sprouted: Do not surrender to death; continue to live by their
    strength. Do not bow your heads; rather, stand up straight and tall in their honor. Lift your eyes beyond the ordinary horizon and look towards the vision
    of the redemption and the End of Days. And even if there are tears in your eyes, those are tears of grandeur.
</p>
<a name="13"></a><h2>4.13 – The Siren and Standing Silently on Yom HaZikaron </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In its “Memorial Day Law,” the Knesset determined that the day before <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> will be “A memorial day for the soldiers of the Israel
    Defense Forces (IDF or <em>Tzahal</em>), who gave their lives to ensure the continued existence of the State of Israel, and for those who fought and fell
    in the campaigns to create the State of Israel – to memorialize them and pay tribute to their courage.” “Memorial services, public gatherings, and
    ceremonies will be held on army bases and in educational institutions. Flags will be lowered to half-mast on public buildings.” In addition, [the Knesset]
    decided that “Two minutes of silence will be observed throughout the country, during which all work and travel will cease.” To facilitate the two minutes
    of silence, a siren wails throughout the country, and people stand still in honor of the fallen. In practice, at 8:00 p.m. <em>Yom HaZikaron</em> evening,
    the siren sounds for one minute, and at 11:00 a.m., the next morning, it wails for two minutes, during which time everyone dedicates his or her thoughts to
    the memory of the fallen. The [official] ceremonies begin immediately thereafter.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some claim that it is forbidden to stand at attention when the siren blasts, because this custom has no basis in Rabbinic literature. Rather, we copied it
    from the Gentiles, and one may not follow the ways of the nations, as it says, <em>Do not follow their ordinances</em> (<em>VaYikra</em> 18:3). In
    practice, however, the vast majority of <em>poskim</em> hold that the prohibition against following the ways of the Gentiles applies only when one of two
    conditions is met: 1) the custom entails a breach of modesty or humility, 2) it has no apparent reason or benefit, making it clear that it is based on a
vain heathen belief (Maharik, <em>Shoresh</em> 88; Rivash 158). Rabbi Yosef Cairo and the Rama concur (<em>Beit Yosef</em> and <em>Haga</em>,    <em>Yoreh De’ah</em> 178:1). Thus, since the custom under discussion has a purpose – by way of the siren and standing silently, everyone unites together to
    remember the fallen – it is not considered a [forbidden] gentile practice.
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Others claim that one should not interrupt Torah study on account of the siren. However, our master and teacher, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook <em>zt”l</em>
    writes, “Standing [silently] for the fallen soldiers of <em>Tzahal</em> contains within it the holy <em>mitzvah</em> of remembering the glory of the holy
    ones.” Moreover, it is possible to say that meditating upon the memory of the holy soldiers and the <em>mitzvah</em> to sacrifice one’s life to save the
    nation and conquer the Land is tantamount to thinking Torah thoughts. And even those who do not understand this must be mindful of Hillel the Elder’s
    teaching: “Do not separate from the community” (<em>Avot</em> 2:4).

</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>4.14 – Holocaust Remembrance Day </h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Knesset legislated that the twenty-seventh of Nissan is “A day of remembrance for the martyrs and heroes of the Holocaust, devoted to the commemoration
    of the disaster that the Nazis and their collaborators brought upon the Jewish people and the acts of heroism and revolt performed in those days.” “It will
    be marked throughout the State by a two-minute silence, during which all work and travel will cease. Memorial services, public gatherings, and
    commemorative ceremonies will be held on army bases and in educational institutions. Flags will be lowered to half-mast on public buildings, and radio
    broadcasts will express the special character of the day.” The two minutes of silence take place at 11:00 a.m., after which the [official] ceremonies
    begin.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, unlike Memorial Day for the fallen soldiers of <em>Tzahal</em>, to which the Chief Rabbinate consented, the Torah sages objected to the
    establishment of Holocaust Memorial Day on the 27<sup>th</sup> of Nissan. After all, the month of Nissan is a time of joy, as the <em>halachah</em>
    determines: one does not say <em>Tachanun</em> or establish a public fast day during the entire month of Nissan (<em>Sh.A. O.C.</em> 429:2). In addition,
    we refrain from delivering eulogies and saying memorial prayers (<em>hazkarat neshamot</em>) throughout the month (<em>M.B.</em> 429:8). Many even have a
    custom not to visit cemeteries in Nissan, and one who has a relative’s <em>yahrtzeit</em> in Nissan visits the grave the day before the month begins.
    Therefore, it is clearly inappropriate to institute, in the month of Nissan, a memorial day for the holy souls who were murdered in the Holocaust. Rather,
    the proper time to remember them is on the fast days that [the Rabbis already] established in commemoration of the destruction [of the Holy Temple],
    especially <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> (the Ninth of Av). Indeed, the Chief Rabbinate established the fast of <em>Asarah B’Tevet</em> (the Tenth of Tevet) as a
    day of general mourning (<em>Yom HaKaddish HaKlalli</em>) over the souls of the holy ones who were killed in the Holocaust, whose date of death is unknown.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It seems to me that the way to, nonetheless, endow the 27<sup>th</sup> of Nissan with some sort of appropriate character is to establish it as a day on
    which to focus on cultivating the “Jewish family.” Undoubtedly, the last request of the six million who were tortured and killed in cruel and unusual ways
    was that the Jewish people should continue to live, multiply, and grow. [They surely hoped] that the terrible suffering that our nation underwent for
    thousands of years, especially during the Holocaust, should not be for naught, that every surviving Jew should do everything in his or her power to marry,
bear children, and continue the legacy, in order to fulfill the verse <em>The more they afflicted them, the more they increased and spread out</em> (    <em>Shemot</em> 1:12). Therefore, it is fitting that public figures get together on this day and come up with ways to encourage marriage and procreation,
    while the teachers speak about the great responsibility that we – the remnants of the sword - have to ensure the continued existence and growth of the
    Jewish nation.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The same goes for the siren. When the siren wails, we should think about how to promote the development of the Jewish nation, in memory of [the victims of
    the Holocaust]. Then, [our participation in this practice] will not be an expression of mourning or <em>hazkarat neshamot</em>, but an expression of
    rebirth and revival, which is appropriate for the month of Nissan. Furthermore, such thoughts would not constitute <em>bitul Torah</em> (wasting time when
    Torah could be studied). In any event, even one who does not have these things in mind should not separate himself from the community.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    With God’s help, our judges will soon be restored as at first and we will pose this question to them, and they will instruct us how and when it is fitting
    to memorialize the holy martyrs.

            </a>
            The Ramban lays down the foundations of the <em>mitzvah</em> of settling the Land in his addendum to <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>, Positive Commandment
4, and our master and teacher, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook <em>zt”l</em> expands upon them in his work <em>LeNetivot Yisrael</em> (vol. 1,<em>LeTokef Kedushato shel Yom HaAtzmaut</em>, Beit El Publications, pp. 246-50, see also pp. 160-62; vol. 2,            <em>Mizmor Yud Tet shel Medinat Yisrael</em>, pp. 357-68). A synopsis: The <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em> applies in every generation,
as the Ramban (loc. cit.) and Rivash (387) write. Therefore, the <em>halachah</em> that a husband and wife can force each other to make            <em>aliyah</em> (<em>Ketuvot</em> 110b) is applicable at all times, as the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> determines (<em>E.H.E.</em> 75:3-5). This is
also the consensus of the <em>Rishonim</em> and <em>Acharonim</em>, as the <em>Pitchei Teshuvah</em> cites there (6). True, <em>Tosafot</em> in<em>Ketuvot</em> (110b) quote Rabbeinu Chayim’s opinion that the <em>mitzvah</em> “does not apply today,” but the greatest <em>Rishonim</em> and<em>Acharonim</em> disregard this opinion, claiming that an erring student authored it (Maharit, <em>Y.D.</em> 28; many of the greatest            <em>Acharonim</em> agree; see also <em>Gilyon Maharsha</em>, <em>Ketuvot</em> 110b; <em>Responsa Chatam Sofer</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 234). The fact
that the <em>mitzvah</em> is mainly fulfilled by way of Jewish sovereignty is elucidated in <em>Yeshu’ot Malko</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 66,            <em>Avnei Neizer</em>, <em>Y.D.</em> 455, and elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <em>Chazal</em>
            comment on several other <em>mitzvot</em> that they are equal to all the rest (circumcision – <em>Nedarim</em> 32a; charity – <em>Bava Batra</em>
            9a; <em>tzitzit</em> – <em>Shevuot</em> 29a; <em>tefillin</em> – <em>Menachot</em> 43b; <em>Shabbat</em> – <em>Yerushalmi Nedarim</em> 3:9; Torah
            study – <em>Peah</em> 1:1; acts of kindness – ibid.). Nonetheless, from a halachic standpoint, <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em> takes precedence over them
all, for it is the only one that overrides a rabbinic injunction relating to the Sabbath (a “<em>shevut</em>”). If someone needs to violate a            <em>shevut</em> in order to perform a <em>brit milah</em> (circumcision) on <em>Shabbat</em>, we postpone the <em>brit</em> instead of violating
            the <em>shevut</em>. For the sake of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>, however, the Rabbis allow one to purchase a home in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> on the
Sabbath, if necessary, even if this entails violating the <em>shevut</em> of <em>amirah le’nachri</em> (telling a non-Jew to do work for you on            <em>Shabbat</em>), as the Talmud states in <em>Gittin</em> 8b and <em>Bava Kama</em> 80b (with <em>Tosafot</em>). And we are not talking about the
            redemption of the entire Land, just the purchase of one house, and it still overrides a <em>shevut</em>! Furthermore, in order to make a protective
            “fence” around the Sabbath, our Sages abrogate the biblical commandments of <em>shofar</em> and <em>lulav</em>, when <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> and the
            first day of <em>Sukkot</em> coincide with Shabbat. When it comes to <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>, however, the Sages revoke their words and permit the
            violation of a <em>shevut</em>, which is a serious offense, as it is supported by a scriptural text (and the Smag apparently considers it a
            biblical prohibition).
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            We are commanded to sacrifice our lives for the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>. After all, the Torah commands us to take possession of
            the Land, i.e. to conquer it; and soldiers endanger their lives in war. See <em>Minchat Chinuch</em> 425.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The reason the Rambam does not include this <em>mitzvah</em> in his count of the 613 is that it is beyond the regular “value” of <em>mitzvot</em>;
therefore, it is not included in their detailed enumeration. This coincides with [one of] the rules the Rambam lays down [at the beginning of]            <em>Sefer HaMitzvot</em>: it is inappropriate to reckon commandments that encompass the entire Torah, as he writes in Mitzvah #153 [that settling
            the Land of Israel is all-inclusive]. Besides which, it is implausible to say that the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em> is only
            rabbinically ordained today [and that that is why the Rambam leaves it out of the count]. After all, <em>Chazal</em>’s statement that settling the
            Land is equal to all the <em>mitzvot</em> of the Torah was made after the destruction of the Second Temple. Now, it is unlikely that they would say
such a thing about a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em>. Moreover, it is improbable that [the Rabbis] would dismantle a family and allow one to violate a            <em>shevut</em> merely for the sake of a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em> (see Rabbi Zisberg’s <em>Nachalat Ya’akov</em>, vol. 1, pp. 201-249).

My teacher and master, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook, explains in detail – in an essay entitled “<em>HaMedinah KeHitkymut Chazon HaGeulah</em>,”            <em>LeNetivot Yisrael</em>, vol. 1, pp. 261-72 – that this is the order of redemption: first there will be a small degree of repentance, with a
            return to the Land and a national revival; then, a complete return to God will ensue. Many sources confirm this; we will mention but a few. In the
            section dealing with repentance in the Book of <em>Devarim</em> (chap. 30), the Torah states that there will first be a return “unto (עד) God,”
            which refers to a minor repentance stemming from fear and harsh decrees. Afterwards, the exiles will gather in the Land, and then a complete return
            “to (אל) God” will take place. R. Tzvi Yehudah explains, based on [his father] our master the Rav’s teachings, that the minor repentance [will
            manifest itself in] a return to the Land (this return began with a holy awakening of love, when the Chassidim and the students of the Gra
immigrated to the Land [in the 1800s]). The book of <em>Yechezkel</em> (chap. 36) also describes the redemption in this order, as does the Talmud (            <em>Sanhedrin</em> 97b). There, R. Yehoshua opines that redemption does not depend on repentance; rather, [God] will empower a king as cruel as
            Haman, and [this will cause] the Jews to repent – that is, they will repent partially. R. Eliezer, who argues with him, remains silent at the end
of the debate, implying that he concedes to R. Yehoshua. Other sources that indicate that redemption is independent of repentance are:            <em>Shemot Rabbah</em> 25; <em>Tikkunei Zohar Chadash</em>; Ramban, <em>Parashat Ha’azinu</em>; <em>Or HaChayim HaKadosh</em>, <em>VaYikra</em>
25:28; R. Elyashuv’s <em>Hakdamot VeSha’arim</em> 6:9. Elsewhere in R. Elyashuv’s book (pp. 273-76), he quotes some of the greatest            <em>Acharonim</em> who viewed the modern-day ingathering of exiles as the beginning of redemption. Our teacher and master, Rav Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen
            Kook adds, in vol. 2, p. 365, that one who fails to recognize these acts of kindness on HaShem’s part lacks faith. And this lack of faith sometimes
            wraps itself in a garb of ultra-Orthodoxy and righteousness, but it is actually a denial of the [divine nature of] the Written Law, the words of
            our Prophets, and the Oral Law. The <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Sanhedrin</em> (98b) quotes [several] <em>Amora’im</em> who were so afraid of the
            terrible suffering that would occur during the era of the birth pangs of <em>Mashiach</em> that they said, “Let him [<em>Mashiach</em>] come, but
            let me not see him.” See other sources in <em>Eim HaBanim Semeichah</em> [by Rabbi Y. S. Teichtal], <em>HaTekufah HaGedolah</em> by Rabbi M. M.
            Kasher, and <em>Kol HaTor</em> – reprinted at the end of R. Kasher’s book – which contains deep ideas that the Gra [revealed to his students on the
            topic of redemption]. See also <em>Ayelet HaShachar</em> by Rabbi Y. Filber, the section entitled <em>Shivat Tziyon HaShelishit</em>.

            The [full] quote can be found in <em>HaTekufah HaGedolah</em>, p. 175. We will mention a few of the sources. Rashi explains [the Gemara’s
            statement] “They shall not go up as a wall” [to mean], “Together, with a strong hand.” The Avnei Neizer (<em>Y.D.</em> 453) writes that if the Jews
            ascend to the Land with the permission of the nations, it is not considered strong-handed. Rabbi Teichtal concurs in <em>Eim HaBanim Semeichah</em>
, pp. 226-28 [English edition], adding that when the Jews in exile encounter great suffering, it is a heavenly sign that they must ascend to            <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> (see the index there). [R. Tzvi Y. Kook] explains this principle briefly in <em>LeNetivot Yisrael</em>, vol. 2, pp. 274-75.
The entire, comprehensive work [of Rabbi M. M. Kasher], <em>HaTekufah HaGedolah</em>, is filled with sources on the <em>mitzvah</em> of            <em>Yishuv HaAretz</em>, the beginning of redemption, and explanations on the three oaths; see pp. 175-76, 273ff.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Even if someone wants to explain the oaths differently, the rule is that we do not derive <em>halachah</em> from aggadic statements. So writes the
            Avnei Neizer (<em>Y.D.</em> 454). Hence, the Rif, the Rosh, and all the other early commentators on Tractate <em>Ketuvot</em> disregard the three
            oaths. On the contrary, they write that there is a <em>mitzvah</em> to ascend to the Land. The Rambam and Shulchan Aruch, as well, leave the oaths
            out of their works. The author of <em>Pinei Yehoshua</em> (on <em>Ketuvot</em> 111a) points out that the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>Yoma</em> (9b)
            implies the opposite – that the redemption did not come because the Jews did not ascend as a wall. And since these two aggadic sources contradict
each other, we must understand them in some other way, not related to <em>halachah</em>. According to the author of <em>Sefer Hafla’ah</em> (            <em>Ketuvot</em>, ibid.), the “wall” only relates to <em>aliyah</em> from Babylonia. The Gra writes in his commentary to <em>Shir HaShirim</em>
            that the oaths relate to the building of the Temple, [warning us] not to burst forth and build it without divine authorization, given through a
prophet. According to Rebbe Tzaddok (<em>Divrei Sofrim</em> 14), even the author of <em>Megillat Esther</em> would agree that there is a            <em>mitzvah</em> [to settle the Land] nowadays. For a comprehensive treatment of this issue, see <em>Nachalat Ya’akov</em> by R. Ya’akov Zisberg,
            vol. 2, pp. 715-815.

            The Pri Chadash (<em>O.C.</em> 496, <em>Kuntras HaMinhagim</em> 14) disagrees with Maharam Alshakar, writing that we should not establish [new]
            holidays after the destruction of the Temple, when [the Rabbis] canceled [the already-existing holidays enumerated in] <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em>.
            However, the Chatam Sofer (<em>O.C.</em> 191) proves that we should create [new] holidays; the fact that they canceled, after the destruction, the
            festive days mentioned in <em>Megillat Ta’anit</em> [is no proof, for they canceled only] the holidays that were connected to the Holy Temple. The
            Chatam Sofer adds and relates that he himself celebrates “Frankfort Purim,” on the 20<sup>th</sup> of Adar, because he was born there, even though
            he had since moved elsewhere. It is also well-known that the Rambam established holidays for himself and his offspring in commemoration of
            salvations that he experienced – for example, surviving a storm at sea. A similar [account is found] in <em>Chayei Adam</em> (155:41). The author
            of <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> (vol. 7, <em>O.C.</em> 44:12) cites many examples of the institution of “Purim” days in various communities and
            consequently rules (vol. 8, omissions 4) that we may establish <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> as a holiday. Two more [important] sources [on this issue]
            from the <em>Rishonim</em> are: Ibn Ezra, <em>BeMidbar</em> 10:10; Rabbeinu Tam, cited in <em>Tosafot</em><em> Ri</em> to <em>Berachot</em> (8a in
            the Rif pages).

            In his <em>Responsa Kol Mevaser</em> (vol. 1, 21:2-3), the brilliant R. Meshulam Roth (about whom our master R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook said that
            he was the <em>gadol ha’dor</em> after the passing of the Rav <em>zt”l</em>) explains – based on the Ramban, the Ritva, and other <em>Rishonim</em>
and <em>Acharonim</em> – that the foundation of the <em>mitzvah</em> to establish <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> as a holiday is the<em>kal va’chomer</em> [mentioned above]. Therefore, establishing it was not in violation of “<em>You shall not add</em> [to the commandments]” (<em>Devarim</em> 13:1), for the prohibition against inventing a holiday refers only to holidays that do not commemorate a salvation. Based on the            <em>kal va’chomer</em>, however, we are obligated to institute holidays that commemorate salvations. R. Roth adds that a prophet is forbidden to
            establish a new holiday based on prophecy. The need to come up with a special scriptural exposition regarding Purim (<em>Megillah</em> 7a) was
            [only] in order to canonize the Scroll of Esther.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Pay attention to R. Meshulam Roth’s reliable statement that [<em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>] was instituted by the majority of the greatest rabbis.
            (Granted, they argued about reciting <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing, but the majority of the greatest rabbis agreed on the basic obligation to
            give thanks and rejoice.) The Chatam Sofer writes (<em>O.C.</em> 191, s.v. <em>mihu</em>) that one might violate the prohibition of adding on to
            the commandments by establishing a holiday for all of Israel. [This does not contradict our thesis, because] he means [that one may not establish a
            nationwide holiday] to commemorate a miracle that happened to one community. We are, however, obligated to establish a holiday for all of Israel
            for a miracle that happened to the Jews as a whole. See also Rabbi Rakover’s <em>Hilchot Yom HaAtzma’ut VeYom Yerushalayim</em>, which includes
            articles on the <em>mitzvah</em> to establish a holiday on <em>Yom HaAtma’ut</em> written by the Chief Rabbis and other great Torah scholars.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Some ask, why did Yehoshua neglect to establish a holiday to celebrate the conquest of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>? The answer is that the holiday of
            Pesach commemorates both the redemption from Egypt and [Israel’s subsequent] entry into the Land. This corresponds to the fifth expression of
            redemption [see <em>Shemot</em> 6:6-8]. Rebbe Tzaddok HaKohen of Lublin posits that the holiday of <em>Tu B’Av</em> (the fifteenth of Av) was
            established for this reason. Also see below, note 7.

            The <em>Yerushalmi</em> (<em>Pesachim</em> 10:6) also teaches [that <em>Hallel</em> should be said on such occasions]: “When the Holy One, blessed
            be He, performs miracles for you, you should say <em>shirah</em> (song),” meaning, you should recite <em>Hallel</em>. <em>Shemot Rabbah</em>
            (23:12) on the Song at the Sea [concurs]: “<em>And they said, saying</em> (<em>Shemot</em> 15:1) – we will say to our children, and our children
[will say] to their children, that when You perform miracles for them, they should say before You a song like this one.” The Talmud (            <em>Megillah</em> 14a) asks why we do not say <em>Hallel</em> on Purim. Three answers are given: 1) Starting from the moment the Jews first entered
the Land, we do not say <em>Hallel</em> on miracles that occur in <em>Chutz LaAretz</em>. 2) Rav Nachman says that the reading of            <em>Megillat Esther</em> is in place of <em>Hallel</em>. 3) Rava answers that we recite <em>Hallel</em> only if the salvation includes freedom from
foreign rule; and we remained subjugated to Achashveirosh after the Purim story. The miracle of <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> occurred in            <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and freed us from the yoke of the nations. Therefore, according to all opinions, we must say <em>Hallel</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The <em>poskim</em> dispute whether the obligation to say <em>Hallel</em> on days the Jews were saved from distress is biblically or rabbinically
            mandated? The author of <em>Halachot Gedolot</em> (the Behag) and other <em>Rishonim</em> hold that it is a biblical obligation. (Until King
            David’s time, no specific formula for praising HaShem was instituted; everyone would compose his own, private [thanksgiving prayer]. After David
            composed the Book of Psalms, however, the prophets instituted that we say specific chapters of Psalms, by which we fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of
            praising and thanking [HaShem].) According to the Rambam, the whole concept of saying <em>Hallel</em> – whether on the biblical holidays or in
            commemoration of the salvations [that God performed] for the Jews – is a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em>. The Netziv posits (<em>She’iltot</em> 26:1)
            that reciting <em>Hallel</em> at the time a miracle occurs, as [the Jews did when they sang] the Song at the Sea, is a biblical commandment, [while
reciting it] every year after that is a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em>. The Chatam Sofer implies that the biblical commandment exists every year (            <em>O.C.</em> 208, s.v. <em>u’mikol makom</em>; <em>Y.D.</em> end of 233).

According to the <em>gaon</em> Rabbi Meshulam Roth, it would have been appropriate to institute the saying of <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing on            <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> immediately after the State was established. He writes: “The leaders who chose this day in particular were correct, for
            that was when the main miracle occurred, when we went from bondage to freedom by declaring independence. Had we postponed this declaration for a
            different day, we would have missed the opportunity and we would not have attained the recognition and consent of the world’s major powers, as is
well known. This miracle also brought in its wake the second miracle: being saved from death to live, both in terms of our war against the Arabs in            <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and the salvation of the Diaspora Jews, who immigrated to the Land. This led to the third miracle: the ingathering of the
            exiles.” Our master and teacher, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook explains further (<em>LeNetivot Yisrael</em>, vol. 1, pp. 248-49) that the courage
            displayed in declaring the State was miraculous in and of itself; see <em>Bava Metzia</em> 106a, with <em>Tosafot</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            However, R. Ovadyah Hadayah (<em>Yaskil Avdi</em>, vol. 6, <em>O.C.</em> 10) – although agreeing fully that [the establishment of the State] was
            the beginning of redemption – cites the Chida in <em>Chayim Sha’al</em> (2:11) as saying that <em>Hallel</em> should be said only over a miracle
that happened to <em>Klal Yisrael</em>, adding that the salvation [of 1948] was not complete. Furthermore, [he asserts that] no miracle happened on            <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>; on the contrary, the war intensified. R. Hadayah is also unsure of the [appropriate] date on which to establish the
            holiday: perhaps the day of the cease fire is most fitting or maybe the 17<sup>th</sup> of Kislev (Nov. 29), when the United Nations confirmed the
            Jewish people’s right to a state. To avoid disrupting the order of our prayers, which were arranged on the basis of deep <em>kavanot</em>
(intentions), R. Hadayah concludes that one should recite <em>Hallel</em> without a blessing at the end of the <em>Shacharit</em> service. The            <em>Rishon LeTzion</em> (Sefardic Chief Rabbi), R. Ovadyah Yosef (<em>Yabi’a Omer</em>, vol. 6, <em>O.C.</em> 41) agrees that we should omit the
            blessing, because the miracle did not happen to all of <em>Klal Yisrael</em> and because we still have a long way to go before reaching a state of
            rest and security, from both a political-military and spiritual standpoint. R. Yosef Mashash (<em>Otzar HaMichtavim</em> 3:1769) holds that one
            should recite the full <em>Hallel</em> (with a blessing). R. Shalom Mashash felt that one should recite the blessing, but when he heard R. Ovadyah
            Yosef’s opinion he ruled that one who [already] has a custom to say the blessing should continue to do so, while one who does not have such a
            custom should refrain from reciting the blessing (<em>Shemesh U’Magen</em> 3:63, 66). Our master and teacher, R. Shaul Yisraeli holds that one
            should recite the <em>Hallel</em> without a blessing. The Chief Rabbi, R. Avraham Shapiro and the <em>Rishon LeTzion</em>, R. Mordechai Eliyahu
concur, but R. Shapiro agrees that one who wants to recite the blessing, in accordance with his custom, is permitted to do so (cited in            <em>Sefer HaRabbanut HaRashit</em>, vol. 2, pp. 901-903).

            Those who hold that <em>Hallel</em> should be said with a blessing explain that the miracle actually did happen to <em>Klal Yisrael</em>, as R.
            Roth writes [above]. Thus, even the Chida would agree. Furthermore, the residents of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> are considered the entirety of Israel.
This is how Rabbi Goren and Rabbi Gershuni explain the matter (their words are cited in a book entitled<em>Hilchot Yom HaAtzma’ut VeYom Yerushalayim</em>). In <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> (loc. cit. 3), R. Ovadyah Yosef writes that the Jews of<em>Eretz Yisrael</em> are considered <em>Klal Yisrael</em> only for specific issues. Rabbi Sharki rebuts this claim in his            <em>Siddur Beit Meluchah</em> (Essay <em>Ba Oraich</em>, sec. 2). Regarding the claim that the salvation was incomplete, we can learn from Chanukah
            that this is irrelevant. After all, the Jews of the time observed the holiday after their first victory, even though they needed to fight many
            more, difficult battles over the next few decades (see below 11.3), establishing a holiday after every subsequent victory (ibid. 11.1). Moreover,
            when the wars finally ended, Hellenism had already spread throughout the Hasmonean Empire (ibid. 11.4). It is implausible to say that [the Rabbis]
            instituted Chanukah only in commemoration of the oil-flask miracle, because the first day [surely] celebrates the military victory. Furthermore,
            the <em>kal va’chomer</em> upon which everything is based relates to the salvation, not the miracle. The fact that many holy soldiers have been
            killed [does not preclude the saying of <em>Hallel</em>]; after all, more fighters were killed in the Hasmonean wars, and they nevertheless
established a holiday. In addition, we have at least as much political independence as the Hasmoneans did. R. Goren substantiates the<em>mitzvah</em> of reciting <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing in his work <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em>, as does [R. Natan Tzvi Friedman] in            <em>Responsa Neitzer Mata’ai</em> (36). This is also the opinion of R. Chayim David HaLevi in <em>Dat U’Medinah</em>, p. 82.

            Quoting testimony by Rabbi [Yehudah] Ushpizai, R. Shmuel Katz writes in his work <em>HaRabbanut HaRashit</em> (vol. 2, p. 841, n. 33) that Chief
            Rabbis Herzog and Uziel believed that it was appropriate to say <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing from the moment the State was established, but
            since they were told that the Chazon Ish and other rabbis strongly opposed this, they refrained from issuing such a ruling, so as not to increase
            strife. On page 890, note 6, [R. Katz] cites Rabbi Zevin as saying that this is cause for eternal weeping: that due to external intervention, by
rabbis who are not members of the Chief Rabbinate’s Council, [the Chief Rabbis] did not rule immediately when the State was born to say            <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing. Similarly, R. Sha’ar Yashuv HaKohen relates that his father, the Nazir, held that one should say <em>Hallel</em>
            with a blessing, but since his opinion was not accepted, he did not recite the blessing, explaining: “I am missing the ‘<em>ve’tzivanu</em>’ (‘He
            has commanded us’) of the Chief Rabbinate.”
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            It is fitting to cite here part of a sermon that our master and teacher, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook, delivered on the nineteenth Independence
            Day, when the Rabbinate had not yet instructed the public to recite a blessing on <em>Hallel</em> (<em>LeNetivot Yisrael</em>, vol. 2, pp. 359-60):
            “An important man approached me and asked why our rabbis do not permit us to recite <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>? I
            answered that the Rabbinate’s decision is balanced and correct. The Chief Rabbinate’s edicts are made for the entire population, and –
            unfortunately and disgracefully – many of our people do not acknowledge God’s great deeds as revealed in the reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty
            [in the Land]. And since they lack this belief, they lack the joy [that goes along with it] and we cannot obligate them to recite a blessing. This
            can be compared to the blessing a person says upon seeing a [long-lost] friend: if he is happy to see his friend, he recites the blessing, but if
            he feels no joy, he does not recite it. Rabbi Maimon, who was totally dedicated to the rebuilding of God’s nation and [territorial] inheritance,
            was filled with the joy of faith [when the State was born]. He, therefore, instituted the recitation of <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing in his
            synagogue. The same is true of other, similar places, like the army and the religious <em>kibbutzim</em>. However, the all-inclusive Chief
            Rabbinate cannot issue a comprehensive ruling for the entire population, instructing them to recite a blessing, when [many people] are not ready
            for this. In our Central Yeshiva (<em>Merkaz HaRav</em>), we follow the Rabbinate’s ruling, because we are not some <em>kloyz</em> (small house of
            study) of a specific group. We belong to the concept of <em>Klal Yisrael</em>, which is centered in Jerusalem, and since – painfully and shamefully
            – there are currently obstacles preventing the public as a whole from attaining perfect faith and joy… it is appropriate that we, too, act in
            accordance with the Rabbinate’s ruling for the general public.”
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            After the Six Day War, R. Tzvi Yehudah bemoaned the fact that [the Rabbinate] did not immediately institute the saying of <em>Hallel</em> with a
            blessing on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. When Rabbi Goren did so after the victory of the Yom Kippur War, R. Tzvi Yehudah was elated, and this became
            the custom of <em>Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav</em>. Even though all types of events have occurred since then – ups and downs – and the Chief Rabbinate is
            not what it used to be, nonetheless, the recitation of <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing was already accepted, and this is how R. Tzvi Yehudah’s
            students conduct themselves.

R. Meshulam Roth’s words are found in <em>Responsa Kol Mevaser</em> 1:21. The [author of] <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> concurs in his            <em>Bi’ur Halachah</em> (692, s.v. <em>she’hechiyanu</em>), writing that one recites <em>SheHechiyanu</em> over the essence of a holiday, even if
            it does not entail a prohibition against work. R. Roth adds that it is preferable to say the blessing before the recitation of <em>Hallel</em>, for
            then it might be considered a blessing over the <em>mitzvah</em>, like the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> we say before lighting the candles on Chanukah. He
            also relies on the opinion of the Bach and his adherents, who hold that the rule of “A doubtful case, involving blessings, is decided leniently
            [i.e., one omits the blessing]” does not apply to the blessing of <em>SheHechiyanu</em>. The Chatam Sofer (<em>O.C.</em> 55) adds that in any
doubtful case involving <em>SheHechiyanu</em>, one is obligated to recite the blessing if he knows that he is happy. Rabbi Goren concurs in            <em>Torat HaMo’adim</em>, as does [Sefardic Chief Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Chai Uziel] in <em>Mishpatei Uziel</em>, third edition, <em>O.C.</em> 23. On
            the other hand, the author of <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> (6:10) writes that one should not recite <em>SheHechiyanu</em> [on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>], for
            the reasons stated above. He also doubts whether the miracle took place specifically on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. [R. Ovadyah Yosef] writes the same
            in <em>Yabi’a Omer</em> 6:42, quoting many <em>poskim</em> who hold that the rule of “A doubtful case, involving blessings, is decided leniently”
            applies to <em>SheHechiyanu</em>, as well. This is also the Beit Yosef’s opinion, and, according to the Rambam, reciting a blessing in vain is a
            biblical transgression. Rabbi [Moshe Tzvi] Neryah agrees that one should not recite the <em>SheHechiyanu</em> blessing on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>.

            Rabbi Goren’s words are found in <em>Torat HaShabbat VeHaMo’ed</em>. See R. Shmuel Katz’s article <em>HaRabbanut HaRashit VeYom HaAtzma’ut</em> (4,
            notes 7, 8, 17, 18). A book entitled <em>KeLavi Shachein</em>, in memory of Gad Ezra <em>Hy”d</em>, contains articles on this issue – one by Rabbi
            Sharki, who supports the saying of <em>Hallel</em> at night and one by R. Ya’akov Ariel, who opposes it. R. Neryah expressed this view before [R.
Ariel did] (see <em>Kovetz Hilchot Yom HaAtzma’ut VeYom Yerushalayim</em>), quoting several reasons why <em>Hallel</em> is recited specifically on            <em>Pesach</em> night, none of which are relevant to <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. R. Ariel Edri concurs in a booklet called <em>Shachar Ahalileka</em>.
            According to Rav Hai Gaon, it seems that we recite <em>Hallel</em> on the first night of <em>Pesach</em> because a person is obligated to view
            himself as if he is actually leaving Egypt that night. Consequently, he must sing praise as the miracle occurs. This does not apply to any other
            holiday. Most rabbis accept this viewpoint. After all, until R. Goren’s tenure as Chief Rabbi, everyone agreed that <em>Hallel</em> pertains to the
            day alone. And when he publicized his ruling to say <em>Hallel</em> at night, it stirred a dispute, and it is unclear whether the Rabbinic Council
            agreed. Actually, R. Tzvi Yehudah Kook instructed Yeshivat Merkaz HaRav to recite <em>Hallel</em> at night, in accordance with Rabbi Goren’s
ruling. However, it seems that he personally disagreed. Later on, when R. Avraham Shapiro became Chief Rabbi, the Yeshiva stopped saying            <em>Hallel</em> at night. Most of R. Tzvi Yehudah’s students follow this practice.

            This has been the Chief Rabbinate’s position throughout. True, in 5741 (1981), Rabbi Goren thought that one should say <em>Hallel</em> on the fifth
            of Iyar that falls out on<em> Shabbat</em>, reasoning that whatever does not entail Sabbath desecration should be done in its proper time, as is
            the case on Purim (<em>Torat HaShabbat VeHaMo’ed</em>). Nevertheless, all the other rabbis held that no distinction should be made, as R. Ariel
            explains in <em>Ohalah Shel Torah</em> 73. R. Ariel assumes, there, that we omit <em>tachanun</em> on the fifth of Iyar (if it falls on a Friday),
similar to <em>Tish’a B’Av</em> that falls out on <em>Shabbat</em>: [even though we postpone the fast until Sunday], the day retains its status of<em>Tish’a B’Av</em> with regard to certain laws (see there). If, however, the fifth of Iyar falls out on <em>Shabbat</em>, we say            <em>Av HaRachamim</em>, because of the misfortunes that occurred in Iyar (this concludes R. Ariel’s comments). It seems to me that we should,
            nevertheless, omit <em>Tzid’katcha</em> from the <em>Minchah</em> service. It also seems – and so decided the Chief Rabbinate in 5764 (2004) – that
when the fifth of Iyar falls on a Monday, pushing off <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> until Tuesday, we do not say <em>Tachanun</em> on Monday. In his work            <em>HaRabbanut HaRashit</em> (pp. 898-99), R. Shmuel Katz explains that even Rabbi Goren originally held that <em>Hallel</em> should be said on the
            day that was chosen for the general celebrations, as opposed to <em>Shabbat</em>. He changed his mind only in 5741 (1981). In footnote 33, R. Katz
            relates, in the name of Rabbi Alfasi, that in 5761 (2001) the members of Rabbi Goren’s synagogue, <em>Komamiyut Avraham</em>, followed the
            prevalent custom [not to say <em>Hallel</em> on <em>Shabbat</em>], because there were those who heard from R. Goren <em>zt”l</em> that the general
            public did not accept his ruling on this matter.

        <p dir="LTR">
            [Rav Kook writes] in <em>Mitzvat Re’iyah</em> (<em>O.C.</em> 688:1) that [the Sages] instituted two days of Purim in order to distinguish between a
            biblical commandment, which has one fixed time for everyone, and a Rabbinic one, which is observed at different times in different locations.
            Perhaps this explains why [the Rabbis] instituted two levels of <em>Mehadrin</em> with regard to the Chanukah candles, something we do not find in
            relation to biblical commandments, whose laws are fixed. Based on this, we can say that it is fitting for <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em> not to have a
            fixed date, seeing that it is a rabbinic enactment.

            See R. Shmuel Katz’s article [on the topic in] <em>HaRabbanut HaRashit</em>, vol. 2, especially pp. 974-75. For the exact wording of the Chief
Rabbinate’s decision, see Rabbi Rakover’s <em>Hilchot Yom HaAtzma’ut VeYom Yerushaliyim</em>, p. 387. On page 125, [R. Rakover] cites a            <em>teshuvah</em> (responsa) from R. Unterman, discussing the great importance of the <em>mitzvah</em> to publicize a miracle, which is possibly
            even greater than reciting the <em>Shema</em>; we even interrupt Torah study [on Purim] to participate in the reading of the <em>Megillah</em>, in
            order to publicize the miracle. There, [R. Unterman] also expands upon the <em>mitzvah</em> of establishing a holiday on a day the Jews were
            delivered [from distress]. Rabbi Kaplan writes likewise (ibid. p. 204). See there, page 61, for an essay by Rabbi Diblitsky on the need to
establish a day of thanksgiving for the Six Day War. According to R. Ovadyah Yosef, however, one should not recite a blessing on the            <em>Hallel</em>, for he holds, based on the Chida’s opinion, that we cannot institute the saying of <em>Hallel</em> with a blessing unless a
            miracle happens to all of Israel, and [R. Ovadyah] does not view the Jews of Zion as the entirety of Israel.

            <em>Rishon Letzion</em>
            (Sefardic Chief Rabbi) R. Yitzchak Nissim writes (<em>Hilchot Yom HaAtzma’ut VeYom Yerushalayim</em>, pp. 334-40) that all customs of mourning are
            canceled on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. He bases his ruling on those <em>poskim</em> who hold that one who has not yet fulfilled the <em>mitzvah</em>
of procreation may get married during <em>Sefirah</em> (Radvaz, Pri Chadash). Similarly, some people take haircuts in honor of <em>Shabbat</em> and            <em>Rosh Chodesh</em> (Radvaz, Ya’avetz). [Furthermore], R. Chayim Palagi writes (<em>Mo’ed LeChol Chai</em> 6) that a miracle happened to some of
            the people of his city on the eighth of Iyar, and to others on the eleventh, and they take haircuts on these days. These are R. Nissim’s proofs.
            There is even more room for leniency when it comes to shaving, because shaving is not festive in nature; it simply eliminates the mournful
            appearance, as we explained above (3.7). The author of <em>Responsa Yaskil Avdi</em> (6:10), on the other hand, does not permit haircuts or
            weddings on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>. Our master and teacher, R. Tzvi Yehudah HaKohen Kook used to rebuke those students who usually shave but look
            like mourners on <em>Yom HaAtzma’ut</em>, saying, “Their countenance testifies against them (cf. <em>Yeshayah</em> 3:9) that they are not happy and
            that they do not [truly] thank HaShem [for the miracle].” See R. Shmuel Katz’s essay in <em>HaRabbanut HaRashit</em>, vol. 2, pp. 877-82.

        <p dir="LTR">
            <strong>Regarding mourners</strong>
, the abovementioned book (p. 900, n. 37) cites a responsa from Rabbi Goren, ruling that, similar to Chanukah, <em>Yom HaAtma’ut</em> and            <em>Yom Yerushalayim</em> do not cancel <em>shiv’ah</em> (the seven day period of mourning for a close relative). [Therefore, the mourner] does not
recite <em>Hallel</em>, nor is <em>Hallel</em> said [by others] in a house of mourning, rather elsewhere. [If the mourner has] completed<em>shiv’ah</em>, he should join the festive prayers and celebrations, as long as there is no live music. A mourner may not take a haircut during            <em>shloshim</em> (the thirty day period of mourning for a close relative) in honor of these holidays.

            Indeed, the Vilna Gaon opines that we may not imitate the nations even with regard to a custom that has a rationale behind it. He, therefore,
            prohibits placing branches in a synagogue on the holiday of <em>Shavu’ot</em>, because the heathens put trees in their houses of worship on their
            holidays (<em>Chayei Adam</em> 131:13; see <em>Bi’ur HaGra</em>, <em>Yoreh De’ah</em> 178:7). Practically speaking, though, most <em>poskim</em>
            disagree with him and uphold the custom of decorating the synagogue [on <em>Shavu’ot</em>], as the Rama (<em>O.C.</em> 494:3) and Magen Avraham
            (ibid. 494:5) write: since there are reasons for this custom, it is not considered following the ordinances of the nations. Now, if that is what
            they say about the custom of placing branches in a synagogue, which is [actually] done in houses of idol worship, there is certainly nothing to
            worry about with regard to the custom of standing silently at the sounding of the siren, which has no hint of idolatry whatsoever. Furthermore, I
            have been told that this custom is almost unheard of amongst the Gentiles.

            <em>Pesikta Zutrata</em>
            (<em>Lekach Tov</em>) on <em>Shemot</em> 2:11, states: “<em>It came to pass in those days that Moshe grew up and went out</em>… He went out to see
            the suffering of Israel. This is what Hillel taught, ‘Do not separate from the community.’ If a person sees the community in pain, he should not
say, ‘I will go to my house, eat and drink, and all will be well with me.’ Rather, one should bear the burden with his fellow [Jews].”            <em>Midrash Seichel Tov</em> on the same verse [adds]: “This is what Hillel taught, ‘Do not separate yourself from the community.’ Our Rabbis
            taught, ‘If the community is in pain and someone separates from them and eats and drinks, two ministering angels accompany him, place food on his
            head, and say, “So-and-so separated himself from the community in their time of trouble; he shall not see the community’s consolation.” ’ [The
            Rabbis] further taught: ‘When the community is in pain, a person should not say, “I will go to my house, eat and drink, and all will be well with
me.” And if he did so, the verse says about him,<em>Behold, joy and gladness, slaying cattle and slaughtering sheep, eating meat and drinking wine; eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die</em> (<em>Yeshayah</em> 22:13). What is written afterwards?            <em>It was revealed in my ears [by] the Lord of Hosts, that you will not be atoned for this sin until you die</em>.’ ”

R. Tzvi Yehudah Kook’s words are quoted in <em>Techumin</em>, vol. 3, p. 388. See also R. Ariel’s <em>Responsa Ohalah Shel Torah</em>,            <em>Yoreh De’ah</em> 23. [R. Chayim David HaLevi] writes in <em>Asei Lecha Rav</em> (4:4) that one who is involved in Torah study at home should
            continue learning, for [standing silently] is illusionary honor, which one must practice only when others are watching. [R. HaLevi adds that] in
            public, one may stand and continue thinking about the topic he was studying. Rabbi Henkin concurs in <em>Techumin</em>, vol. 4, p. 125. However, I
            believe that what I wrote [above] is correct, for contemplating the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Kiddush HaShem</em> (sanctifying God’s name) is itself
            [considered] meditating on Torah, and it is preferable to include oneself in the community with holy thoughts.
