    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        "One must become strong like a lion to arise in the morning to serve
his Creator, for he should be the one who awakens the dawn" (SA        <em> </em>1:1). The way one gets up in the morning largely indicates
        her spiritual and emotional state and influences her functioning
        throughout the entire day. One who has purpose in life wakes up driven
        and filled with alacrity to face a new day. She usually wakes up early
        in the morning so she can accomplish more throughout the day. However,
        one who has lost her moral bearings and sense of mission has lost the
        reason for living and has no challenge that makes it worth getting up
        in the morning. She therefore feels fatigued and distressed in the
        mornings. Only when left with no choice does she finally wake up, late
        and sluggish, to another dull and despondent day. Nevertheless, if she
        were to bolster her faith and arise eagerly, vitality and joy would
        ignite her spirit, and she would be able to start her day invigorated.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The Aĥaronim recommend saying <em>Moda Ani</em>, "I thank You, living
        and eternal King, for You have returned my soul with compassion.
Abundant is Your faithfulness" immediately upon waking up (        <em>Seder Ha-yom</em>, aYHaYMB 1:8). Faith gives purpose to life. If
        God chooses to grant someone life, it means that her existence has
        great value. From that conviction, one can arise in the morning with
        enthusiasm and strength. The Sages state that one must wake up like a
        lion because a lion symbolizes one who has self-esteem and self-respect
        and uses that insight to courageously overcome all obstacles (see R.
        Naĥman of Breslov’s <em>Likutei Halakhot ad loc.</em>).

    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Even when one is alone is her house, it is proper that she acts
        modestly, and covers her body. She should not say, "Here I am in the
        privacy of my own room; who can see me?" for God’s honor fills the
        whole world. She must cover her body in God’s honor and out of respect
        for the divine image within her. For men, every body part that one
        usually covers out of respect when he is among family and close friends
        should also be covered when he is alone. Concerning women, since the
        rules of modesty are defined – sleeves until the elbow and skirts until
        below the knee – it is proper to walk around the house in that manner
        even when no other person is present.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Similarly, it is inappropriate for girls who live in a same-sex
        dormitory to walk around in immodest clothing. When getting dressed, it
        is proper for her to be strict and not change her undergarments in the
        room. She should change in the bathroom, shower room, or under a cover
        (<em>Peninei Halakha</em>:<em> Prayer</em>, ch. 7 n. 1).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Regarding a hair covering for a married woman in her house, some say
        that since the laws concerning hair-covering are not as strict as those
        governing the covering of one's body – after all, it is unnecessary for
        single women to cover their hair yet they are required to cover their
        bodies – then as there are no strangers in her home, she may walk
        around without her hair covered. Other <em>poskim</em> are stringent
        and rule that she must cover her hair even when she is alone in her
house (<em>Peninei Halakha</em>:        <em>Collected Essays IIICollected Essays III</em> 3:6:18). However,
        when she is in her bedroom alone or with her husband while in a state
        of purity, she need not cover her hair.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        To explain the idea <em>tzni’ut </em>a bit, it is necessary to begin
        with the creation of mankind. When created, Adam was pure and clean,
        both spiritually and physically, and he did not feel any need to cover
        himself with clothing. However, after his sin, he began to feel ashamed
        of his nudity. From then on, we all cover our bodies with clothes,
        especially those parts connected to physical drives and disposal of
        waste.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The bare body emphasizes in an extreme manner the materialistic and
        animalistic side of humans. However, the form of the human body, with
        all the details and intricacies of its limbs, also contains profound
        and phenomenal allusions to the soul, which the wisdom of the Kabbala
        discusses in great length. It is the destiny of the body to actualize
        all those ideas. However, following the sin, our view became more
        external. At first glance, we only see the corporeal component of the
        human body, which causes us to forget its spiritual core. Therefore, it
        is proper to conceal the body, to better emphasize one’s inner
        spirituality, which is the source of his allure, and allow refined
        beauty to extend over his whole body. That is what the Sages allude to
        when they state that modesty in particular preserves beauty, by the
fact that it nourishes its eternal root (see <em>Bamidbar</em>        <em>Rabba</em> 1:3).
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        As we have learned, the restraint expressed by modesty emphasizes one’s
        spiritual component. In addition, modesty greatly contributes to the
        concentration of the body’s vital energies on the reinforcement of the
        connection between husband and wife. Modesty turns lust into love. Many
        people incorrectly think that <em>tzni’ut </em>is meant to dull beauty
and the joy of life; however, the exact opposite is true.        <em>Tzni’ut</em> preserves one’s beauty and vitality for her spouse,
        with whom one enters a covenant, in order to increase love, devotion,
        and life.

            3. Getting Dressed and Putting on Shoes: The Practice of the Pious
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The practice of the pious (<em>minhag ĥasidim</em>) is to begin with
        the right side in all matters, because the Torah attributes more
        importance to one’s right side (as in the ritual of sprinkling the
        blood of a leper’s guilt offering onto his right thumb and big toe).
        According to Kabbala, right signifies lovingkindness (<em>ĥesed</em>),
        and left signifies judgment (<em>din</em>). By favoring the right, we
        help <em>ĥesed </em>overcome <em>din</em>. Thus, the scrupulously pious
        eat with their right hands, wash and anoint the right before the left,
        and put on the right sleeve, pant leg, and sock before the left. When
        bathing, they wash the head first, and then wash the right arm before
        the left arm and the right leg before the left leg. When getting
        undressed, they first remove the article from the left side.
        <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Concerning shoes, the law is more complex. On one hand, one should
        begin with the right side. On the other hand, we learn from the mitzva
        to tie <em>tefillin</em> on one’s left arm, that for all matters
        involving tying one is to start with the left side. Therefore, one
        first puts on her shoes, right before left, without tying them, and
        when tying the laces, she starts with the left and then ties the right
        (<em>Shabbat</em> 61a; SA<em> </em>2:4).
        <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        One who is left-handed and left-footed begins with the right when she
puts her shoes an as well as when she ties them. Since lefties tie        <em>tefillin </em>on their right arms, the right takes precedence for
        tying as well.
        <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        The purpose of these practices is to ensure that everything we do, even
        a routine act like putting on shoes, is done mindfully and
        meticulously. After all, everyone puts on shoes every day, and if so,
        why shouldn’t she do it in the most optimal way? Certainly, the order
        is not a <em>sine qua non</em>; one who puts her shoes on out of order
        need not take them off to put them on again in the appropriate order.
    </p>
    <p align="left" dir="LTR">
        Through these <em>halakhot</em>, the Sages teach us to attribute value
        to every act we perform. This allows us to grasp all the details of the
        actions that make up our lives more deeply.

            <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>
            1 n. 14, expresses uncertainty about whether women, who do not put
            on <em>tefillin</em>, need to ascribe importance to the left side
            when tying. In his <em>Sha'ashu’ei Zvi</em> §3, R. Zvi Pesaĥ Frank
            writes that a woman may tie whichever side she prefers first. Even
            so, it seems that it is better that women also tie the left before
            the right, since the precedent from <em>tefillin</em> teaches that
            left precedes right in all matters of tying.

MB<em> </em>2:6, based on <em>Bekhor Shor </em>(and see            <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak </em>10:1)<em> </em>. This implies, therefore,
            that concerning putting on other clothing, even a lefty who takes
            on pious practices should start with her right side, just as blood
            would be sprinkled on a lefty’s right thumb (based on the opinion
of most <em>poskim</em>; see <em>Encyclopedia Talmudit</em>,            <em> </em>vol. 1, s.v. "<em>iter</em>"). However, regarding eating,
            we obviously do not trouble a lefty to eat with his right hand.
            Regarding the recitation of a <em>berakha</em>, it is the opinion
            of MB 206:18 (based on several Aĥaronim) that a lefty should hold
            the object on which he is reciting a <em>berakha</em> in his left
            hand. The kabbalists maintain that he should hold it in his right
            hand (<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 206:30).
