    Chapter Eight: Washing One's Hands in the Morning
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    1. Morning Washing
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
The <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the washing of one's hands every morning and the recital of the blessing, "    <em>Asher kideshanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al netilat yadayim</em>," ("ï¿½Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the washing
    of hands.")
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    A person's hands endow him with the capability to function in this world. With his hands he can give and receive, hold and deliver, handle his different
    belongings, and care for his body. However, along with, and perhaps because of, their versatility, one's hands also wallow in all the dealings of this
    world and tend to get dirty and contaminated more than any other limb. Whenever it is necessary to elevate and distance ourselves from the lower aspects of
    this world in order to engage in matters of sanctity, we wash our hands. This is the general significance of washing hands, including the washing in the
    morning. However, the <em>Rishonim</em> disagree as to the exact reason behind the morning washing.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Rosh</em>, since a person's hands are constantly moving, it is almost certain that during one's sleep they touch parts of the body
    that are normally covered. Therefore, in order to purify them before <em>Shacharit</em>, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the washing of one's hands.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Rashba</em>, every morning people are created anew, as it is written (Lamentations 3:23), "They are renewed every morning; abundant is
    Your faithfulness!" A person goes to sleep tired, gives his soul over to his Creator, and arises in the morning with renewed strength. This new creation
    should be sanctified and designated for serving Hashem by washing one's hands in the morning.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In other words, according to the <em>Rosh</em>, the washing of one's hands in the morning is solely in preparation for prayer, and according to the<em>Rashba</em>, this washing constitutes a preparation and sanctification for prayer and for service of Hashem throughout the entire day.    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>

    2. Hand Washing Concerning One Who Did Not Sleep All Night
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Based on what we have learned in the previous halachah<em> </em>(according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>), in the <em>Rashba</em>'s opinion, even a
    person who did not sleep at night must wash his hands with a <em>berachah</em> in order to sanctify himself so that he may thank Hashem for a new day. In
    the <em>Rosh</em>'s opinion, however, because he did not sleep, there is no concern that he unintentionally touched the parts of his body that are normally
    covered and therefore it is unnecessary to wash his hands before praying.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Hence, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules (4:13) that a person who remains awake all night must wash his hands without a <em>berachah</em>. He must wash his
    hands, according to the opinion of the <em>Rashba</em>, however he does not make a blessing on that washing, so as not to recite a <em>berachah</em> in
    vain, consistent with the opinion of the <em>Rosh</em>.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes (4:30) that a person who did not sleep all night should relieve himself before <em>Shacharit</em>. After his hands
    touch the parts of his body that are normally covered, then even according to the <em>Rosh</em>, he must wash his hands with a <em>berachah</em>. He can
    therefore wash his hands with a <em>berachah</em> according to all opinions. This is the Ashkenazic custom for those who stay awake all night on Shavuot.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The <em>minhag</em> of the <em>Sephardim</em> is that before praying, even a person who touched the normally covered parts of his body washes his hands
without a <em>berachah</em>. This is because we take into consideration the opinion stating that the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted washing with a    <em>berachah</em> only for a person who slept at night. But a person who dirtied his hands and did not sleep is the same as one whose hands were dirty
    before <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> - he washes his hands without a <em>berachah</em>. The sole advice for someone who was awake all night and
    wants to fulfill the obligation according to all opinions is to hear the <em>berachah</em> recited by another person and have in mind to fulfill his
    obligation by hearing it (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:49). (See further in this book 8:5; 9:5-6, for the law regarding someone who remains awake all night, or
    who wakes up in the middle of the night, concerning the recital of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> and <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>.)
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    3. Ruach Ra'ah (Evil Spirit)
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    In addition to the reasons we have mentioned, the <em>Chachamim</em> state in the Talmud (<em>Shabbat</em> 108b) that one must be careful that his hands do
    not touch his mouth, nose, eyes, or ears before washing his hands in the morning because there is a <em>ruach ra'ah</em> (evil spirit) which rests upon
    one's hands after sleep and it is likely to damage those organs. Only after he washes his hands three times alternately will the <em>ruach ra'ah</em>
    disappear and, subsequently, the danger caused by touching any of his bodily orifices will be eliminated.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
The essence of the morning washing is to prepare and sanctify oneself for praying <em>Shacharit</em> and for the service of a new day. For that reason, the    <em>Chachamim</em> instituted reciting <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>. Nevertheless, we are also careful about the<em> ruach ra'ah</em>, and in order to
    remove it, we must be strict in washing our hands three times alternately from a vessel. This means that we first wash the right hand, then the left, then
    again the right and left, and another time right and left, which comes out to be three times, each hand alternately.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Prior to washing, one must take care not to touch those organs that have openings toward the inside of the body - such as the mouth, nose, ears, and eyes (<em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</em> 4:3-4; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 13). Similarly, one must be cautious not to touch food or drink before washing (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:14).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    The Kabbalah teaches (see <em>Zohar</em>, part 1, 184:2) that at night, when a person falls asleep and remains inanimate, without thought and action, he
experiences a taste of death and a spirit of impurity (<em>ruach ra'ah</em>) rests upon him. This is in line with <em>Chazal</em>'s statement (    <em>Berachot</em> 57b) that sleep is one-sixtieth of death. The essence of human virtue lies in one's ability to think, feel, and engage in activities
    leading to the rectification of the world (<em>tikun olam</em>). During sleep, when dormancy spreads throughout the body, a person loses, to a certain
    extent, the image of God (<em>Tzelem Elokim</em>) within him, and the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> rests upon him. When he awakens from his sleep and his
    consciousness returns, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> disappears, remaining solely on the extremities of his hands. By washing one's hands three times
    alternately, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> is removed. In order to completely nullify it, one must begin washing his right hand, which symbolizes the attribute
    of <em>chesed</em>. Therefore, one should take the washing cup initially in his right hand and pass it over to his left, so that he pours the water over
    the right hand first and then the left, continuing this way until he has washed each hand three times (see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:12). In this way, the
    stern judgments associated with the attribute of <em>gevurah</em> (represented by the left hand) are made subservient to the attribute of <em>chesed</em>
    (represented by the right hand).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Some explain that the main damage caused by the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> is spiritual; if he were to touch his eyes or ears before washing, his internal senses
    of sight and hearing would be adversely affected, and on that day he would be like a blind and deaf person concerning matters of Torah and faith.
    Similarly, if he were to touch his mouth or nose, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> would harm his spiritual senses of eating and smelling (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
    4:19, based on <em>Solet Belulah</em>).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    4. Ruach Ra'ah Today
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    According to the <em>Zohar</em> and the kabbalists, one must wash his hands next to his bed in the morning, so as not to prolong the <em>ruach ra'ah</em>
    upon himself. They also warn not to walk more than four <em>amot</em> before washing one's hands in the morning. Therefore, one must prepare water before
    going to sleep and place it near his bed so that immediately upon rising he can wash his hands (<em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em> 1:2). There are those who are
    lenient regarding this because in their opinion the entire house is considered four <em>amot</em>. As long as one does not have to leave the house more
than a distance of four <em>amot</em> in order to wash his hands, he is not thought of as someone who prolongs the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> upon himself (    <em>Shut Shevut Yaakov</em> 3:1).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Some maintain that <em>ruach ra'ah</em> has been nullified from this world. The <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Yoma</em> 77b) bring the opinion that this<em>ruach ra'ah</em> does not dwell in the regions comprising the Ashkenazic countries. The <em>Lechem Mishneh</em> writes that it is implied from the<em>Rambam</em> that he, too, is not concerned about the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> mentioned in the Talmud (<em>Shevitat HeAsor</em> 3:2). Also, the<em>Maharshal</em>, who lived approximately 400 years ago, and who was one of the eminent <em>poskim</em> in Ashkenaz, writes that in our times, no    <em>ruach ra'ah</em> exists around us (<em>Chullin</em>, chapter 8, 31). A number of other <em>poskim</em> agree with this approach.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In earlier generations, spiritual and mystical power was more pronounced and intense. This was expressed on the one hand by the ability to attain greater
    and more transcendental experiences, emotionally and spiritually, such as prophecy, and, on the other hand, by the presence of all sorts of sorcery and
    impure spirits. As time passed, intellectual strength took center stage at the expense of emotional powers, and together with the cessation of prophecy,
    the impure spirits weakened and disappeared; in their place there are evil spirits of false and deceitful ideas.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Furthermore, there is an amazing tradition regarding Graf Potoczki, born in Poland to aristocratic parents, who had his heart set on joining the nation of
    Israel and converting to Judaism. Since such a thing was prohibited in his time, he converted secretly and engrossed himself in Torah. Eventually, the
    Christians captured him and offered him two options: to return to Christianity or to be burned alive. The righteous convert chose to die by fire, thereby
publicly sanctifying God's Name. At that moment, the Vilna Gaon said that the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> lost some of its strength, particularly regarding the    <em>ruach ra'ah</em> of <em>Shacharit</em>. For this reason the students of the Vilna Gaon are lenient regarding walking four <em>amot</em> before washing.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
In practice, according to the <em>Chida</em>, <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (1:2), and <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, one should be careful not to walk more than four<em>amot</em> before washing. In contrast to them, there are <em>poskim</em> who are lenient, whether it is because the entire house is considered four    <em>amot</em>, or because today the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> on one's hands has ceased to exist. That is the common custom. However, even according to those
    who maintain that the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does not fully exist among us, it is customary to be strict concerning everything mentioned in the Talmud, such
    as washing one's hands three times and not touching bodily orifices prior to washing.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    5. The Time to Recite <em>Al Netilat Yadayim</em>
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    The correct time to recite the "<em>Al netilat yadayim</em>" <em>berachah</em> is immediately after washing and before drying one's hands. However, the
    general rule regarding all <em>berachot</em> recited upon the performance of <em>mitzvot</em>, is to recite the <em>berachah</em> first and then perform
    the mitzvah. Hence, we make a <em>berachah</em> on the wrapping of <em>tefillin</em> before binding them on our arms, and we make a <em>berachah</em> on
    the <em>mezuzah</em> before affixing it to the doorpost. Yet, regarding <em>Al netilat yadayim</em> the law is different. Since it is inappropriate to
recite the <em>berachah</em> while one's hands are unclean, its recital is delayed until after the washing. Still, we may not separate the    <em>berachah</em> from the act of the mitzvah and therefore, immediately after washing, before drying one's hands, the <em>berachah</em> must be recited.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In actuality, the <em>berachah</em> is usually not recited immediately following the first washing upon waking. This is because people generally need to
relieve themselves upon waking up, and one should not recite a <em>berachah</em> while having to tend to one's bodily needs. Furthermore, according to the    <em>Rosh</em>, the washing was instituted to prepare the person for prayer; therefore, one is obligated to recite a <em>berachah</em> on the washing before
    praying. Hence, after relieving oneself in the morning, one washes his hands again and recites the <em>berachah</em> before drying them. One who does not
need to relieve himself in the morning should recite the <em>berachah </em>on the first washing<em> </em>immediately upon waking up (    <em>Shulchan Aruch </em>6:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:4).<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Regarding one who rises from his sleep long before he intends to pray, and knows for certain that prior to praying he will need to defecate, there is
    uncertainty concerning when it is proper to recite <em>Al netilat yadayim.</em> According to the <em>Rashba</em>, who maintains that one washes in honor of
    the new day, it is proper that he recite the <em>berachah</em> immediately upon waking up. According to the <em>Rosh</em>, who maintains that the washing
    was instituted as preparation for prayer, he should recite the <em>berachah</em> on the washing right before prayer. In this case, it is advisable to
    recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> immediately following the washing performed upon rising, and then, to a certain extent, <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> will be
considered the beginning of prayer and the washing a preparation for them. That way, even according to the <em>Rosh</em> one may recite    <em>Al netilat yadayim</em> immediately upon waking up.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
Therefore, whoever wakes up after <em>chatzot </em>(halachic midnight) must wash his hands, recite <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>, and say all of    <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. However, if, after remaining awake for a few hours, he intends to go back to sleep until the time to pray arrives, after waking
    up the first time he must wash his hands without a <em>berachah</em>, and after the second time he must wash with a <em>berachah</em>, for that is the
    waking closest to prayer. (Regarding <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> see further in this book 9:5, where it is explained that it is preferable to recite them
    after the main waking, provided that it is after <em>chatzot</em>.)<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>

    6. Hand Washing Following Daytime Sleep
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    There is uncertainty regarding what precisely causes the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> to linger on one's hands. Is it the mere state of sleep, when a person's
    consciousness abandons him and he is left without the ability to function, requiring even one who sleeps during the day to wash his hands three times upon
    awakening to remove the <em>ruach ra'ah</em>. Or, is it brought about by the night, when the entire world ceases its activities, and therefore even a
    person who was awake all night must wash his hands three times?
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In practice, when both causes intertwine and someone sleeps at night a regular sleep (approximately half an hour), the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> rests upon him
    in full force. In such a case, immediately upon rising one must hurry to wash his hands three times and refrain from touching his bodily orifices or food
    prior to that washing. (Still, the <em>berachah</em> on this washing is only recited before <em>Shacharit</em>, as explained in halachah 5.)
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    It is proper for one who slept a regular sleep during the day to be stringent and wash his hands three times alternately, but it is unnecessary for him to
rush to do so. Also, there is no prohibition forbidding him from touching his bodily orifices before he washes.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Additionally, it is best that one who remained awake all night wash his hands three times at <em>alot hashachar</em>. Likewise, it is proper for a person
who arose in the middle of the night and already washed his hands three times when he woke up to wash his hands alternately again when<em>alot hashachar</em> arrives, for perhaps the night itself and its cessation induce the <em>ruach ra'ah</em>.    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    7. Waking in the Middle of the Night to Tend to a Baby or for Any Other Reason
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    Parents who wake up in the middle of the night in order to cover their children or give them a pacifier, in principle need not wash their hands because
    covering a child or putting a pacifier in his mouth does not require touching the child's mouth or any other bodily orifice.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, if one wakes up to prepare food for the child or change the child's diaper, it is proper to wash one's hands prior to that, in order not to touch
    food or one of the child's bodily orifices with unwashed hands. Likewise, it is proper that a woman who wakes up in the middle of the night to nurse her
    child wash her hands before starting. However, if it is very difficult for her to go wash her hands, she may rely on the lenient opinions that do not
    obligate one who awakens in the middle of the night to wash his or her hands (<em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> 4:1; see also halachah 4 which mentions that
    some say that nowadays the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does not exist). In any case, according to all opinions, no <em>berachah</em> is recited on washing
    performed in the middle of the night because the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted a <em>berachah</em> only on the morning washing, which prepares us for
    prayer and the new day.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    <em>L'chatchilah</em>
    it is proper that a person who wakes up in the middle of the night to drink wash his hands three times before reciting <em>Shehakol</em>. Similarly, it is
    proper that one who wakes up in the middle of the night to relieve himself wash his hands three times so that he can touch his bodily orifices without
    concern. After relieving himself, he must wash his hands so that he may recite <em>Asher Yatzar</em>. If he wishes, he may refrain from washing his hands
    prior to relieving himself in the middle of the night, by relying on the opinion of those <em>poskim</em> who maintain that a person only needs to wash his
    hands three times after rising in the morning. However, after relieving himself, he must wash his hands in order to recite <em>Asher Yatzar</em>. If he
    does not have water, he must clean his hands, for example by rubbing them on his shirt, and then recite <em>Asher Yatzar</em> (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
    4:22).<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>

<a name="8"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    8. Food Touched by Unwashed Hands
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
    We learned (in halachah 3) that because the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> rests upon one's hands in the morning, one must not touch food or drink before washing his
    hands. Regarding a Jew who touched items of food without washing his hands, the ruling is as follows: if it is a dry food, like fruit, that can be washed,
    he should rinse it under water three times. Just as the washing of each hand three times purifies them, so will this washing purify the fruit. However, if
he mistakenly touched drinks or food that will become ruined when washed, although there are those who are stringent to dispose of them for fear that the    <em>ruach ra'ah</em> rests upon them (<em>Od Yosef Chai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 6), according to most <em>poskim</em>, even those foods that cannot be washed
    are permitted to be eaten.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    There are two reasons for this: first, because according to the majority of <em>poskim</em>, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> on one's hands does not have the
    ability to render food unfit for eating (<em>Chayei Adam</em> 2:2; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:14; <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 4:15). Although, regarding an
    alcoholic beverage, such as liquor, there are <em>poskim</em> who are stringent. In any case, it is agreed among most <em>poskim</em> that all other foods
    do not become invalidated by the touch of unwashed hands (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 4:5 s.v. "<em>Lo</em>"). Furthermore, there are those who maintain that
    the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> has been nullified from this world (as brought in halachah 4) and there is no need to fear its damage. Therefore, one should not
    discard or waste foods that were touched by unwashed hands.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    Similarly it is permissible <em>l'chatchilah</em> to buy bread or other food that is sitting on a store shelf, even though there is concern that it was
    touched by Jews who did not wash their hands in the morning. This is because, as we have already learned, according to most <em>poskim</em>, food is not
    invalidated by the touch of unwashed hands. Additionally, there is doubt as to whether these foods were actually touched by someone who did not wash his
hands in the morning. Moreover, almost all people usually wash their hands in the morning, and it is said in the name of the <em>Arizal</em> (    <em>Od Yosef Chai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 8), that even washing one's hands once is useful in weakening the power of the<em> ruach ra'ah</em>.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2 dir="LTR">
    9. Minors
</h2>
<p dir="LTR">
A number of eminent <em>Acharonim</em> write that it is important to ensure that even small children, who have not yet reached the age of understanding (    <em>gil chinuch</em>), wash their hands in the morning. The reason for this is that if they don't wash their hands, the food they touch will become ruined
    by the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> that is upon them (<em>Chida</em>; <em>Pri Megadim</em>, <em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 4:7; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:10).
    Additionally, there are those who abide by the extra pious act of washing a newborn baby's hands, as the<em> Ben Ish Chai</em> (<em>Toldot</em> 10) writes,
    for by doing so, the children are raised with purity and sanctity.
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    However, in practice, many people are not strict about the washing of their children's hands three times after they wake up, because according to some
    prominent <em>Acharonim</em>, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> only lingers on the hands of one who is at least thirteen years of age. The more a person can
    connect to holiness and act to repair the world, the more the evil spirit contrastingly strives to make him impure. Hence, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does
    not rest on the hands of gentiles, for they are not obligated to perform <em>mitzvot</em>. Similarly, concerning children, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does
    not rest upon them in its full force until they are sanctified in the obligation of performing the <em>mitzvot</em>. Still, we are commanded to educate
    minors to perform the <em>mitzvot</em>, and once they start observing the holy commandments, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> slightly lingers upon them as well.
    Therefore, from the time they reach the age of understanding and are capable of comprehending how to wash their hands, one is obligated to educate them and
accustom them to washing (based on <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav Tinyana Edition</em> 4:2; <em>Eshel Avraham</em> <em>Butshatsh</em> 4:3; <em>Tzitz</em>    <em>Eliezer</em>, part 7, 2:4).
</p>
<p dir="LTR">
    In conclusion, it is a mitzvah to accustom children from the time they reach the age of understanding to wash their hands three times after sleeping, and
    it is an obligation to wash their hands starting from the age of <em>mitzvot</em>, meaning thirteen years old for a male and twelve for a female. There are
    those who are stringent to wash their bab?y's hands from the time he can touch food (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:10). Additionally, there are individuals
    who enhance the mitzvah by washing their baby's hands starting from the time of his <em>brit milah</em>, or even from birth, for even then Israel's unique
    holiness begins to appear (as brought in parenthesis in <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> there; see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:22 as well).

            There are two sources for the morning washing: <em>Berachot</em> 60b, where it appears as one of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> and seems to correspond
            to the opinion of the <em>Rashba</em>; and <em>Berachot</em> 14b-15a, where it appears as a preparation for prayer, consistent with the opinion of
            the <em>Rosh</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            There is an opinion which states that a <strong>woman</strong> who does not intend to pray <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> on a particular day should wash
without reciting a <em>berachah</em>, for according to the <em>Rosh</em>, this washing was instituted specifically for prayer (            <em>Shut Machazeh Eliyahu</em> 11). However, in practice, women have the custom to follow the <em>Rashba</em>, and recite a blessing on the morning
            washing regardless. The <em>Bach</em> writes that even the <em>Rosh</em> agrees that the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted washing in the morning as
            part of <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, but that according to the <em>Rosh</em>, one also needs to wash his hands with a <em>berachah</em> before
            praying <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> if his hands are dirty.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            <strong>The essential objective of the morning washing before <em>Shacharit</em> is cleanliness,</strong>
            as it is written (Psalms 26:6), "I wash my hands clean," and this is clarified in <em>Berachot</em> 15a. The reason for washing one's hands before
            a meal is for purification and sanctification, similar to the washing of the <em>Kohanim</em>'s hands in the <em>Kiyor</em> (laver) before they
            worked in the Temple. Although there is a difference between the objectives of the two washings, the <em>Chachamim</em> instituted the washing in
            the morning following the example of washing before a meal, and even the <em>berachah</em> has the same wording. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, when
            washing in the morning, one should take care that all the necessary requirements for washing one's hands before a meal are met - that there is at
            least a <em>revi'it</em> of water, that he washes with a vessel, that there is human force involved in the pouring (<em>ko'ach gavra</em>), and
            that the appearance of the water has not changed. <em>B'dieved</em>, even if there is no <em>revi'it</em> of water there, or a vessel, or human
force (<em>ko'ach gavra</em>), since the water does in fact clean a person for prayer, it is the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and the            <em>Rama</em> that the "<em>Al netilat yadayim</em>" <em>berachah</em> is recited. If the appearance of the water has changed and became invalid
for washing before a meal, one may use it to wash his hands for <em>Shacharit</em>, but instead recite "<em>Al nekiyut yadayim</em>" (            <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> section 4, paragraphs 1, 6, 7, 22). However, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:7, and <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> write that
            according to many <em>Acharonim</em>, even if the water becomes invalid for washing before a meal, one may recite <em>Al netilat yadayim</em> when
washing before <em>Shacharit</em>, because the water does clean his hands enough for prayer. <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:11 and            <em>Halachah Berurah</em> 4:12 write that one does not recite a blessing for the washing in the morning if there is anything that renders it
            invalid for washing before a meal.

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:4, based on the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, writes that one who wakes up and needs to relieve himself, before doing so
            must wash his hands three times without a <em>berachah</em> in order to remove the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> from upon them. After relieving himself, he
            must wash his hands and recite the <em>berachah</em> because according to the <em>Rosh</em>, the morning washing with a <em>berachah</em> was
            instituted as preparation for prayer. However, Rav Ovadyah Yosef (<em>Halachah Berurah</em> 4:4; <em>Beirur Halachah</em> 4:4) rules that one
            should first relieve himself in the bathroom and then wash his hands three times so that the <em>berachah</em> will be on the first washing of the
            day, for that is the more correct way according to the <em>Rashba</em>. Furthermore, if a person has a great need to relieve himself, to the point
            where if he abstained he would be transgressing the prohibition, "Do not abominate oneself," the law is that one must relieve himself first and
            only after that wash his hands. It is possible to retort to this argument that there is no issue of "abominating oneself" in such a case since
            washing one's hands takes so little time. The practical custom follows the opinion of the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> and the kabbalists, in order to
            quickly purify oneself from the<strong><em> </em></strong><em>ruach ra'ah</em>. Regarding the <em>berachah</em> being recited before drying one's
            hands, see <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:8. However, according to the Ashkenazic<em> minhag</em>, one may delay reciting the <em>berachah</em> and combine
it with <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. Nevertheless, it is best to recite it immediately following the performance of the mitzvah, as the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> writes in 6:9.

            However, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 4:1 s.v. "<em>V'Afilu</em>") rules like the <em>Chayei Adam</em>, maintaining that
if one wakes up much earlier than the time to pray and he knows that he will need to relieve himself again before praying, he should recite a<em>berachah</em> on the washing closest to praying, for that is how he fulfills the obligation <em>l'chatchilah</em> according to the            <em>Rosh</em>. Even in the opinion of the <em>Rashba</em> one may delay reciting the <em>berachah</em> on washing and recite it immediately before
            praying. That is what the <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 1:6, and <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2:23 write as well.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Still, many <em>Acharonim</em> write that it is preferable to recite the blessing on the washing closer to one's waking for that is the correct way
            according to the <em>Rashba</em>. Even according to the <em>Rosh</em>, if he recites <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> immediately after the first washing,
it is possible that they will be considered the beginning of prayer, as write the <em>Shlah</em>, <em>Graz</em> (in his <em>siddur</em>, p. 1),            <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em>, <em>Derech HaChaim</em>, and <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> 4:5. The <em>Aruch</em> <em>HaShulchan</em> explains
            further that even according to the <em>Rosh</em>, the washing of one's hands and the recital of the <em>berachah</em> were instituted to be
            performed adjacent to one's waking, just like the other <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>. Even according to the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 6:9, it is
            possible to rely on those <em>poskim</em>. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:52 writes as well that one must recite <em>Al netilat yadayim</em>
immediately upon getting up. Additionally, he brings a dispute of the <em>Acharonim</em> as follows: there are those who say that one may recite            <em>Al netilat yadayim</em> even before <em>chatzot</em>, which is the custom of the kabbalists (<em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 13).
            However, the <em>Graz</em> and others write that one must recite <em>Al netilat yadayim</em> only after <em>chatzot</em>. I wrote that one should
            recite it only after <em>chatzot</em> in order to avoid uncertainty. If he intends to go back to sleep (when he woke up after <em>chatzot</em>),
indeed according to the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 46:49, based on the Kabbalah, and the <em>Graz</em>, he should recite<em>Al netilat yadayim</em> after his first waking. In any case, in this situation, it seems better to practice according to the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, <em>Chayei Adam</em>, and the <em>Gra</em>, as I have written.

            The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 4:14-15, mentions this uncertainty and rules to wash three times, but without a <em>berachah</em>
            because of doubt. The <em>Eshel Avraham</em> 4:1 writes in the name of his father-in-law that being careful not to walk four <em>amot</em> and not
            to touch bodily orifices only apply when one wakes up for <em>Shacharit</em> from a nighttime sleep and does not intend to go back to sleep.
            However, one who wakes up in the middle of the night for a few minutes and intends to return to sleep need not be cautious to refrain from walking
            four <em>amot</em> without washing his hands or touching his bodily orifices, just as a person sometimes touches his bodily orifices while
            sleeping. Only after the final waking from his nighttime sleep must one be strict about these things. He writes further that this lends credence to
            the many who are lenient regarding this. Concerning waking up from a daytime sleep, he writes that it is obvious that one need not be careful to
            refrain from touching bodily orifices, and he himself acted that way. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:52 writes in the name of the kabbalists, based on
the <em>Arizal</em>, that the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> only rests upon one who sleeps through <em>chatzot</em>, but if he did not sleep through            <em>chatzot</em>, even if he slept a regular sleep on his bed, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does not exist, and therefore it is not necessary to wash
            three times. However, the <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Toldot</em> 15, writes that one needs to wash his hands three times after every regular sleep,
            even during the day; though if that sleep did not continue through <em>chatzot</em>, it is not necessary to be strict in refraining from touching
            bodily orifices or in taking any other precautions. The <em>Sha'arei Teshuvah</em> 4:1 cites an opinion that even a person who slept during the day
            needs to be careful not to touch his bodily orifices or food. Some act this way <em>l'chatchilah</em>.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            For the amount of sleep necessary to be considered a regular sleep, see <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 4:16 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 4:55. Some say it is
            three hours and some say it is three minutes, though the average amount of time accepted by the majority of <em>poskim</em> is approximately half
            an hour, as I have written.

            This is how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 4:14 rules based on what he wrote in the <em>Beit Yosef</em> in the name of <em>Orchot Chaim</em>.
            According to this, presumably there is a need to be stringent not to touch one's bodily orifices after <em>alot hashachar</em> until he washes his
            hands. (See also <em>Hagahot</em> of Rabbi Akiva Eiger 4:1, where it is implied that from the time he wakes up at night and washes his hands three
            times, he should not touch his bodily orifices until he washes his hands again three times after <em>alot hashachar</em>.) However, the opinion of
            the majority of <em>poskim</em> and kabbalists is that there is no lingering of the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> at the end of the night, and therefore,
            although we take into consideration the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, and the <em>minhag</em> is that one who is up at night, or who
            wakes up before <em>alot hashachar</em>, goes back and washes his hands again three times after <em>alot hashachar</em>, nonetheless, we are not
            very strict about this. That is what the <em>Eshel Avraham</em> writes in 4:1, as well as <em>Da'at Torah</em>. Especially someone who is engrossed
            in Torah need not stop his learning in order to wash his hands. As it seems, regarding this law, we are even more lenient than we are about the
ruling concerning one who sleeps during the day, as implied from <em>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</em> 4:13. <strong>In practice</strong>, after            <em>alot hashachar</em> it is customary to wash again three times, but one need not be careful not to touch his bodily orifices, nor rush to wash
            at the moment <em>alot hashachar</em> arrives. In addition, there is doubt as to when exactly <em>alot hashachar</em> is (see further in this book
            11:1). Therefore, after <em>alot hashachar</em> according to all opinions, he should wash his hands three times. One who is engrossed in Torah
            study should first finish the subject he is learning and then go wash his hands.

            The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 4:14-15 maintains that every regular sleep at night brings the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> and one must wash his hands three
            times alternately. Even so, in the cases above, I wrote "it is proper" because the <em>Eshel Avraham</em> writes in the name of his father-in-law
            (as brought in note 4) that the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> exists only after waking up in the morning. Many who have become accustomed not to wash their
            hands when they arise in the middle of the night rely on this. The basis for <em>Eshel Avraham</em>'s words is found in the <em>Beit Yosef</em>
            (4:14-15) who writes that there is concern that at <em>alot hashachar</em> the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> may rest even upon those who were awake all
night. The opinion of most kabbalists, according to the <em>Ari</em>, is that the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> only lingers after a person sleeps through            <em>chatzot</em>, but if one went to sleep after <em>chatzot</em>, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does not rest upon his hands. Moreover, even if a
            person who slept through <em>chatzot</em> already woke up once after <em>chatzot</em> and washed his hands three times, the <em>ruach ra'ah</em>
            does not rest upon his hands a second time. Hence, according to this, it is not necessary to wash one's hands three times upon every waking at
            night. In addition to this, there are those who say that nowadays the <em>ruach ra'ah</em> does not exist. Therefore, only one who wakes up in the
            morning must be careful to wash his hands three times because the source for this stems from the Talmud. However, beyond that, concerning waking up
            in the middle of the night, it is not an obligation to wash one's hands, though it is proper to do so. Those who practice according to Kabbalah
must ensure that the first time they wake up after <em>chatzot</em> they wash three times. Also from the standpoint of <em>Birkat</em>            <em>Shehakol</em>, it is proper to wash one's hands, but it is not an obligation, as explained in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 4:23. Even if he
touched normally covered parts of his body, he can suffice with rubbing his hands on a cloth of some sort, as clarified in the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 4:61. Similarly, before relieving oneself, it is advisable to wash one's hands because of the <em>ruach ra'ah</em>, but it
            is not an obligation, as clarified above. Additionally, see the opinion of Rav Ovadyah Yosef in note 2.
