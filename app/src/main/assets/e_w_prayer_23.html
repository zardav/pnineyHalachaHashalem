    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        It is a mitzva to have an expansive Rosh Ĥodesh meal (SA<em> </em>
        419:1). One may perform any type of labor on Rosh Ĥodesh; however,
        women customarily reduce their workload a bit on Rosh Ĥodesh. This is a
        noble custom, because Rosh Ĥodesh is considered a minor holiday for
        women, a reward for not having participated in the sin of the Golden
Calf (SA 417:1; MB 3; this is explained at length in        <em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</em> 1:6-7).

    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from <em>Birkat Ha-levana</em> (a monthly blessing on
        the moon), since it is a time-bound mitzva. Although according to
        Ashkenazic custom women may recite such <em>berakhot</em>, the
        widespread custom is that women do not recite this <em>berakha</em> (MB
        426:1).

        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are exempt from the mitzva of <em>shofar</em> since it is a
        positive time-bound mitzva, though women who wish to fulfill it earn
reward. It is customary for Jewish women to fulfill the mitzva of        <em>shofar</em>. If a man who already heard the <em>shofar</em> blows
        for women, he does not recite a <em>berakha</em> on their behalf. If a
woman who follows Ashkenazic custom is present, she recites the        <em>berakha</em> before the blowing, and if there are other women in
        attendance, they listen to her and respond "amen." However, if all the
        women present follow Sephardic custom, they fulfill the mitzva without
        a <em>berakha</em> (SA 589:6; above, 2:8).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As we have learned (above, 2:9), the <em>poskim</em> disagree about
whether women must pray <em>Musaf</em>. Some say that since        <em>Musaf</em> contains a request for mercy, it is like other
        obligatory prayers, which, according to Ramban and most <em>poskim</em>
        , women must recite. Furthermore, since <em>Musaf </em>was instituted
        to honor the sanctity of the day, women must recite it just as they
        must recite <em>kiddush</em> (<em>Magen Giborim</em>). Others maintain
        that since <em>Musaf</em> is time-dependent, women are exempt from its
        recitation (<em>Tzelaĥ</em>). In practice, since it is a rabbinic
        commandment, halakhic practice follows the lenient opinion and women
        are not obligated to pray <em>Musaf</em>, although they may do so and
        are rewarded for it. On Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, it is proper that
        all women pray <em>Musaf</em> because the primary request for mercy on
        the Days of Awe is in <em>Musaf</em>.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women fulfill <em>Hatarat Nedarim</em> (the annulment of vows) with the
        recitation of <em>Kol Nidrei </em>on the eve of Yom Kippur. Therefore,
women should make sure to arrive at the synagogue in time for        <em>Kol Nidrei</em>. A married woman may appoint her husband as an
        agent and ask him to annul her vows when he annuls his own. However, an
        unmarried woman may not appoint another man or woman to annul vows on
        her behalf (SA 239:56; <em>Taz </em>46; <em>Rav Pe’alim </em>OĤ

the mitzva to sit in the <em>sukka</em> and the mitzva to take the        <em>lulav</em>, and women are exempt from both. If they wish to perform
them, they earn reward. According to Ashkenazic custom, they recite a        <em>berakha </em>on the performance of these <em>mitzvot</em>, and
according to Sephardic custom no blessing is recited on sitting in the<em>sukka</em>, though with regard to <em>lulav</em>, some recite a        <em>berakha </em>and some do not. Every woman should continue following

            4. "They too Participated in that Miracle" – Pesaĥ, Purim, and
            Ĥanuka
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        R. Yehoshua b. Levi said: Women must drink four cups of wine on the
night of the Seder (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 108b), read the <em>megilla</em> (        <em>Megilla</em> 4a), and light Ĥanuka candles (<em>Shabbat</em> 23a)
        "for they too participated in that miracle."
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        There are two interpretations of this dictum: According to Rashi and
        Rashbam (<em>Pesaĥim</em> 108b; <em>Shabbat</em> 23a) women’s
        obligation stems from the fact that they participated significantly in
        those miracles. Regarding the Exodus the Sages said: "In the merit of
        the women who lived in that generation the Israelites were redeemed
        from Egypt" (<em>Sota</em> 11b). Despite the terrible slavery, the
        women did not lose hope of redemption; they reassured their husbands
        and gave birth to the next generation. The miracle of Purim, of course,
        transpired through Esther. The miracle of Ĥanuka began with a woman
        named Yehudit, who heroically beheaded the enemy governor and led to
the abolition of the Greek decree of <em>jus primae noctis</em> (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</em>, ch. 11 nn. 12-14). Thus, from a
        certain standpoint, women’s connection to these <em>mitzvot</em>
        supersedes that of men.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
However, most commentaries understand that the words "they too" ("        <em>af hen</em>") indicate the primary obligation applies to men (who
        are obligated in time-bound positive <em>mitzvot</em>) and that women
        are obligated in the mitzva secondarily because "they too participated
        in that miracle" (<em>Tosafot Pesaĥim</em> 108b and <em>Megilla</em>
        4a, Rashba, Ritva, Ran, Me’iri, and others).

        <a name="_Toc402175353">5. Ĥanuka</a>
    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        As we have learned, women are obligated to light Ĥanuka candles, for
        they too participated in that miracle. A married woman fulfills her
        obligation through her husband’s lighting, and a daughter by her
        father’s. However, if the husbands or fathers do not light, either
        because they are not home or for another reason, the wife or daughter
        must light. A woman who lives alone must light her own candles.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
A daughter who lives in her father’s house may light with a        <em>berakha</em> according to Ashkenazic custom, even though her father
        already lit. According to Sephardic custom, only the head of household
        lights in the home (see <em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</em> 12:3-4 and n.
        2).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women customarily do not work while the Ĥanuka candles are burning, to
        demonstrate that these lights are for the sake of a mitzva and not for
        any utility and because the Ĥanuka miracle began with Yehudit, giving
this holiday a higher status for women – akin to that of        <em>Ĥol Ha-mo’ed</em>. According to the first reason, cooking and
        frying are forbidden at this time, because perhaps the light of the
        candles will assist the performance of these actions. According to the
        second reason, only actions forbidden on <em>Ĥol Ha-mo’ed</em>, such as
        laundry and sewing, are forbidden while the candles are burning;
        however cooking and frying foods are permitted, and that is the common
        custom. Families that customarily refrain from cooking and the like
        should continue to follow their custom.

        Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that women must recite <em>Hallel</em> on

        gratitude for it. However, according to most <em>poskim</em>, they are
        not obligated, and that is the prevailing custom. Those who wish to
        enhance the mitzva are commendable. According to Ashkenazic custom,
        they recite it with a <em>berakha</em>, and according to Sephardic
        custom, they recite it without a <em>berakha</em>.

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
The <em>poskim</em> disagree about whether women must hear        <em>Parashat Zakhor</em>. According to most <em>poskim</em>, women are
        exempt because the mitzva to remember what Amalek did is linked to the
        mitzva to eradicate Amalek, and since women are not commanded to fight
in wars, they need not remember what Amalek did to the Israelites (        <em>Sefer Ha-Ĥinukh</em> §603). Others maintain that women have a
        connection to the mitzva of war since they must assist the fighters,
        and therefore the mitzva to remember Amalek applies to them too.
Although the Sages ordained a specific time to read        <em>Parashat Zakhor</em> – the Shabbat before Purim – according to the
        Torah it has no set time. Since hence it not a time-bound mitzva it
        applies to women as well (<em>Minĥat Ĥinukh</em> <em>ad loc</em>.).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        In practice, according to most <em>poskim</em> women are exempt from
        hearing <em>Parashat Zakhor</em>; however, <em>le-khatĥila</em> it is
        preferable that she hears it in order to satisfy all opinions. A woman
        who has difficulty getting to the synagogue but still wishes to fulfill
        the mitzva should recite the passage from a <em>ĥumash</em>, since
        according to many one thus fulfills the biblical obligation to
        remember. In a place where a Torah class is held for women in the
synagogue, it is permissible to take out a Torah scroll to read them<em>Parashat</em> <em>Zakhor</em>. Even though there is no        <em>minyan</em> present, it is still preferable that they hear the
        passage from a kosher Torah scroll.

Women are obligated in all four <em>mitzvot</em> of Purim – reading the        <em>megilla</em>, <em>mishlo’aĥ manot</em> (sending gifts of food to a
        friend), <em>matanot le-evyonim</em> (gifts to the poor), and a festive
        meal.
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        <em>Mishlo’aĥ manot</em>
is fulfilled by giving two portions to one person.        <em>Matanot le-evyonim</em> is fulfilled by giving two poor people two
        gifts each. Married women are obligated in these two <em>mitzvot</em>,
        so a married couple bust give <em>mishlo’aĥ manot</em> to two different
        people, one from the husband and one from the wife. Likewise, together
        they must give <em>matanot le-evyonim</em> to four poor people, two
from the husband and two from the wife (MB 795:25). Nevertheless, some        <em>poskim</em> say that a couple fulfills the mitzva jointly, by
giving one <em>mishlo’aĥ manot</em> and two <em>matanot</em>        <em>le-evyonim</em>. Even according to this opinion, however, adult
        sons and daughters do not fulfill their obligation through their
        parents (AHS 794:2). Halakhic practice follows the majority opinion,
and even married women must give <em>mishlo’aĥ manot</em> and<em>matanot</em> <em>le-evyonim</em> of her own (see        <em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</em> 16:6).
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
        Women are obligated to rejoice on Purim by drinking wine. However, they
        should take care not to get drunk, since drunkenness is more shameful
        for women than for men and constitutes a breach of <em>tzni’ut</em>, a
trait for which women are praised<em> </em>(<em>Ketubot</em> 65a;        <em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim </em>16:11).
    </p>

        Concerning the custom of giving <em>tzedaka </em>before Purim to
        commemorate the half-shekel that was contributed to the Temple while it
        stood, some <em>poskim</em> exempt women whereas others obligate them.
        The common custom today is to give at least a half-shekel for each
        member of a household, even a fetus (<em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim </em>
        14:10).

    </h2>
    <p dir="LTR">
        According to Rashi and Rambam, women and men are equally obligated in
the mitzva to read the <em>megilla</em>, and a woman may read the        <em>megilla</em> for her husband. In contrast, <em>Behag</em> and
        Rabbeinu Ĥananel maintain that women’s obligation differs from that of
        men: men must read the <em>megilla</em>, whereas women must hear it.
Therefore, a man who reads the <em>megilla</em> recites the        <em>berakha</em> "<em>al mikra megilla</em>" ("concerning the reading
of the <em>megilla</em>") and a woman who reads for herself recites "        <em>lishmo’a megilla</em>" ("to hear the megilla"). According to this
opinion, a man does not fulfill his obligation with his wife’s reading.        <em>Responsa Avnei Nezer</em> (OĤ 511) explains that this difference
        stems from the fact that women must hear the <em>megilla</em> only in
        order to publicize the miracle, and therefore their obligation is only
        in hearing the <em>megilla</em> and not reading it. In contrast, men
        are commanded to publicize the miracle and also to remember Amalek to
wipe him out ultimately. Therefore, men are commanded to read the        <em>megilla</em>.

        Since the Rishonim are evenly split on this issue, most Aĥaronim rule
        that a woman may not read the <em>megilla </em>on a man’s behalf except
        in extenuating circumstances, when it is not possible for the man to
        read for himself or hear it from another man. In that case, at least he
        will fulfill the mitzva according to the opinion that a woman may read
        on a man’s behalf.

        According to the vast majority of <em>poskim</em>, a woman may read on
        behalf of other women. Some say that a woman cannot fulfill the
        obligation on behalf of many women, since <em>megilla</em> reading has
        a status similar to Torah reading, and just as a woman does not read
        from the Torah, so too she does not read the <em>megilla</em> for many
        women. Some <em>poskim</em> say that when the <em>megilla</em> is read
for women no <em>berakha</em> is recited (<em>Ben Ish Ĥai</em>, year 1,        <em>Teztaveh</em> 1; <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 689:19). However, halakhic
        practice follows the overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em> who
        maintain that a woman may read on behalf of other women and that if the
group is comprised of ten women, the reader recites the        <em>berakha </em>of "<em>Ha-rav et riveinu</em>" ("Who fights our
        battles") after the <em>megilla</em>. However, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, it
        is preferable that women hear the <em>Megilla </em>read by a man, to
        satisfy all opinions. Ideally, women would hear the <em>megilla </em>in

        Women are exempt from the mitzva of counting the <em>omer</em>, for it
        is a positive time-bound mitzva. If a woman wishes to fulfill this
        mitzva, it is a credit to her. As we have learned (above 2:8),
        according to Sephardic custom she does not recite the <em>berakha</em>,
        but according to Ashkenazic custom she may recite it.

    <p dir="LTR">
        However, even within Ashkenazic custom, some <em>poskim</em> are
        worried that since women are not present in the synagogue at the time
        of the counting of the <em>omer</em>, there is a reasonable concern
        that she will forget to count one day without realizing it and then
continue counting with a <em>berakha</em>. According to        <em>halakha</em>, one who forgets to count one day may not continue
        counting with a <em>berakha</em>, and if she does, according to some,
        it<em> </em>is considered a <em>berakha le-vatala</em>. To avoid this
        problematic situation, some say that even according to Ashkenazic
        custom it is best that women do not recite a <em>berakha</em> on this
mitzva (MB 489:5). Others say that women should not count the<em>omer </em>for kabbalistic reasons (<em>Rav Pe’alim</em>, vol 1,        <em>Sod Yesharim </em>12). In contrast, some say that Ashkenazic custom
        is that women count the <em>omer </em>(MA 489:1). Therefore, according
        to Ashkenazic custom, whoever knows that she will be able to complete
        the entire count and that she may not recite a <em>berakha </em>anymore
        if she forgets, may recite a <em>berakha</em>. In particular, this
        pertains to women who regularly pray <em>Ma’ariv</em> or who are

            This <em>berakha </em>is reciting on the waxing moon. For
            Ashkenazim, this is from the third day of the month until the full
            moon, and for Sephardim it is from the seventh of the month until
            the full moon. Women are therefore exempt; so state MA and MB
426:1. <em>Ĥokhmat Shlomo</em> challenges this by noting that the            <em>berakha </em>does not depend on time but on the phase of the
            moon, for we may only give thanks for it when it is waxing, just as
            we may only recite <em>She-heĥeyanu </em>on fruit when it is newly
            appeared on the trees. However, a distinction can be made between
            the two cases: <em>She-heĥeyanu</em> is recited over new fruits and
            depends not on a specific time but on the condition of the fruits,
            whereas <em>Birkat Ha-levana</em> completely depends on time, for
time is established based on the moon. See            <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>16:10 and in the notes. The prevailing
            custom is that women do not recite it, and MB mentions the
            explanation of <em>Shlah </em>(<em>Sha’ar Ha-otiyot</em> 100) that
            women refrain from reciting this blessing because the deficiency of
            the moon was caused by the sin of the first woman which in turn
            precipitated Adam’s sin. Out of shame, women refrain from reciting
            the <em>berakha </em>on the renewal of the moon. Even though this
            sin was rectified when they did not participate in the sin of the
            Golden Calf (even while the flaw persisted among men), and for this
            reason Rosh Ĥodesh was given to women to observe to a greater
            degree than men, a woman nevertheless was the direct cause of the
            moon’s deficiency, and therefore, out of shame, they refrain from
            reciting a <em>berakha </em>over its renewal. However, Me’iri
            states based on the Gemara in <em>Sanhedrin</em> 42a that women
            must recite this <em>berakha </em>but that since they are not
            familiar with the wording, they may recite a shorter version of it.
            See AHS 426:14. <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim </em>426:1 states that it is best
            for a woman to hear the <em>berakha</em> recited by a man.

According to Ĥida and<em> Zekhor Le-Avraham </em>(as cited in<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 17:4 and 589:23), women recite a            <em>berakha </em>when taking the <em>lulav</em>. This is also the
            position of <em>Rav Pe’alim</em> (vol. 1, <em>Sod Yesharim </em>12)
and R. Messas (<em>Shemesh U-magen </em>2:72:3) regarding            <em>lulav</em>, and this was the practice in the family of R.
            Ovadia Hadaya. In contrast, according to SA, they do not recite a
            blessing. <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 1:68 and <em>Yabi’a Omer </em>
1:38-42 and 5:43 strongly support the custom of SA not to recite a            <em>berakha </em>and mention that some Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em>,
            including <em>Ĥakham Tzvi</em> and <em>Divrei Ĥayim</em>, ruled
            against reciting this <em>berakha</em>. See above, 2:8, and n. 9

            Based on <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Sukka</em> 38b), some Aĥaronim infer
            that women must recite <em>Hallel</em> on Ĥanuka, because "they too
            participated in that miracle" so they too must express gratitude
            for it, just as they must recite <em>Hallel</em> on Pesaĥ night.
This is the opinion of <em>Torat Refael</em> OĤ 75,            <em>Hitorerut Teshuva</em> and <em>Binyan Shlomo</em> 2:63.
            However, according to most <em>poskim</em> (as well as MT, Laws of
            Ĥanuka 3:6) women are exempt from <em>Hallel</em> on Ĥanuka, since
            it is a time-bound positive mitzva. One possible explanation for
            this is that women fulfill their obligation of thanksgiving by
            lighting the candles. This stands to reason because for many
            generations most women did not know how to say <em>Hallel</em>, and
            it is problematic to say that they were obligated but did not
            fulfill their obligation. Rather, everything that is connected to
            the synagogue prayer service, which is dependent on time, does not
            obligate women. Yet they must recite <em>Hallel</em> at the Seder
            because it takes place at home and because women are obligated in
            it from the Torah, and everything the Sages instituted for men what
instituted for women as well. See <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 1:78,<em>Halikhot Shlomo: Mo’adim</em> 2:17:6, and            <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>8:5 and in the notes.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            Rambam writes (MT, Laws of Ĥanuka 3:6) that since women are exempt
            from <em>Hallel</em>, they cannot recite it on behalf of men, who
            are obligated. This would seem to apply to <em>Hallel</em> on Rosh
            Ĥodesh as well, as indicated by MA<em> </em>422:5. However, BHL
            §422 s.v. "Hallel" states that since <em>Hallel</em> on Rosh Ĥodesh
            stems from custom and not obligation, and both women and men are
            technically exempt, presumably she may recite it on a his behalf.

            The mitzva can be fulfilled on the Torah level by commemorating it
            once a year, and therefore the mitzva is not considered time-bound.
            However, according to many, since women do not wage war, they are
not obligated to remember the eradication of Amalek. The            <em>poskim</em> who disagree maintain that women are obligated to
            fight in mandatory wars (<em>milĥemet mitzva</em>), and Radbaz (on
            MT, Laws of Kings 7:4) explains that they are required to supply
            soldiers with food and water. Although women are exempt according
            to most <em>poskim</em>, they should preferably satisfy all
opinions, as stated in <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 1:84. See            <em> Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Zemanim</em> 14:7 n. 9.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
            The <em>poskim</em> disagree about the parameters of the biblical
obligation. Rosh implies that the Torah commandment is to hear the            <em>Parashat Zakhor</em> from a valid Torah scroll, whereas Ramban
            indicates that this is a rabbinic enactment. Likewise, there is
            disagreement about whether according to the Torah it must be read
with a <em>minyan</em> (see <em>Peninei Halakha:</em>            <em>Zemanim</em>, ch. 14 n. 7). It seems that if it was the Sages
            who ordained reading the passage with a <em>minyan</em> and from a
            Torah scroll, it would constitute fixing a specific time – the
            Shabbat before Purim. Since the rabbinic enactment is thus
            time-bound, women are exempt from it. Even according to the opinion
            that women must remember Amalek, they would not need a Torah
scroll. So states <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 685:30 in the name of            <em>Limudei Hashem </em>and <em>Erekh Ha-shulĥan</em> §2.
        </p>
        <p dir="LTR">
Thus, <em>le-khatĥila</em>, women should hear it with a            <em>minyan</em>. If they cannot, it is best that it is read to them
            from a Torah scroll without a <em>minyan</em>. If that too is not
            possible, then it is best that it is read from a <em>ĥumash</em>.
            Still, some Aĥaronim state that a Torah scroll is not removed from
the ark for women (see <em>Responsa Kinyan Torah</em> 7:53 and            <em>Halikhot Beitah </em>9:8). However, it is unclear what the
            problem with removing a Torah scroll for them is since in principle
            it is permissible to remove one for the sake of Torah study. The
            custom in Ashkenazic communities was to take out a Torah scroll for
the women’s reading, as cited by <em>Minĥat Yitzĥak</em> 9:68 and            <em>Torat Ha-mo’adim </em>2:13.

            Women are exempt from the other three special <em>parshiyot </em>
read in Adar (<em>Shekalim</em>, <em>Para</em>, and            <em>Ha-ĥodesh</em>), for they are time-bound. According to those
            who maintain that <em>Para</em> is a biblical mitzva (as cited in
            SA 685:7), perhaps women are obligated since the Torah does not
            specify a particular time. However, MB 685:15 states that according
            to many Aĥaronim it is a rabbinic obligation whose time is fixed in
            Adar, so women are exempt.

            <em>Turei Even</em>
on<em> Megilla</em> 4a states that the mitzva of reading the            <em>megilla </em>is derived, first and foremost, from the text of
            the <em>megilla </em>itself, which was composed with Divine
            inspiration. This is a time-bound positive mitzva and thus applies
            only to men. The obligation of women is derived from the rationale
            that "they too participated in that miracle," a rationale that is
            solely rabbinic. Therefore, according to <em>Behag</em> and
            Rabbeinu Ĥananel, a woman cannot read on a man’s behalf..

            There are Aĥaronim who interpret SA 689:1-2 to mean that a woman
can read on a man’s behalf, and that this is indeed the<em>halakha </em>(<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 271:1;            <em>Ma’amar Mordechai</em> 689:2). The view of most Aĥaronim is
that a woman should not read on a man’s behalf. So state<em>Levush</em>, <em>Eliya Rabba</em> 689:2, <em>Pri Ĥadash</em> 1,<em>Erekh Ha-shulĥan</em> 3, <em>Ĥikrei Lev</em>, and            <em>Derekh Ha-ĥayim</em>. Some interpret SA as taking a stringent
approach (<em>Pri Megadim Eshel Avraham</em> 4; and see<em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 689:14). See <em>Peninei Halakha:</em>            <em>Zemanim</em> 15:7 nn. 6 and 7.

            <em>Korban Netanel</em>
            (on Rosh, <em>Megilla</em> 1:4:m) innovatively suggests that a
            woman may not read on behalf of many women. This is cited in SHT
689:15. However, it seems that the intent is to be stringent            <em>le-khatĥila</em>, because SHT 16 states that the dominant
opinion is that women and men have an equal obligation.<em>Halikhot Beitah </em>(<em>Petaĥ Ha-bayit</em> 25; also cited in            <em>Halikhot Shlomo</em> 19 n. 4) states that R. Shlomo Zalman
            Auerbach questions <em>Korban Netanel</em>’s explanation and
            concludes that halakhic practice follows R. Tikochinsky, who rules
            in <em>Lu’aĥ Eretz Yisrael</em> that a woman may read on behalf of
            many women. The reason for the opinion that no <em>berakha</em> is
recited on a reading for women is concern for the position that no            <em>berakha </em>is recited when reading for an individual, and
women collectively are considered to be like an individual (            <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> 689:19). The opinion of most <em>poskim</em>
is that there is no need to be concerned for this at all. See            <em>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim </em>15:7 and n. 8.

            According to <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 5:34, even women at home must
            recite <em>Hallel</em> with a <em>berakha</em> on Pesaĥ night
            before the start of the Seder, just like men customarily recite it
            in the synagogue, because it is recited in praise of the miracle.
            This is based on Sephardic custom, as mentioned in SA 487:4.
            However, according to Rema’s custom, it is not recited in the
            synagogue. Some say that even in Sephardic custom it should not be
            recited by an individual (<em>Beit Yehuda</em>). Accordingly, women
            who are at home should not say it either. Since this is a matter of
            uncertainty pertaining to a rabbinic enactment, halakhic practice
            follows the lenient opinion and women are exempt from the
recitation of <em>Hallel</em> before the Seder night. See            <em>Mikra’ei Kodesh</em> ch. 3 nn. 18-19, which states that many
            women did not know how to recite it so it is inconceivable that
            they would have been required to recite it while home alone.

            <em>Pesaĥim</em>
            <em> </em>
            108a states that a woman need not recline if she is in her
            husband’s presence, with the exception of an important woman. SA
            472:4 rules accordingly. (The rationale is that if reclining in the
            manner of free people does not reflect an inner sense of freedom,
            it has no purpose. This is similar to the logic behind a disciple
            not reclining in the presence of his rabbi without permission.)
            There are different opinions about what defines an "important
            woman"<em> – </em>that she is not subservient to her husband, that
            she is wealthy, that she is pedigreed, or that her husband does not
            mind if she reclines. Rema states that all women nowadays are
            considered <em>ĥashuvot</em>, but the custom is nevertheless that
            they do not recline, as per Raavya, who says that there is no
            longer a mitzva to recline at the Seder since we do not recline at
            formal banquets in general. In practice, all women from all
            communities should try to recline, because the prevailing custom
goes against Raavya’s opinion on this matter, as            <em>Knesset Ha-gedola</em> and <em>Kaf Ha-ĥayim</em> (28) state.
            Many Ashkenazic women in fact do so. But if a woman forgot to
recline, she need not eat or drink again, since the mitzva<em> </em>of reclining is rabbinic, and there are several            <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women are exempt, either because
            they are not <em>ĥashuvot</em> or because the view of Raavya is
            correct. See <em>Ĥazon Ovadia</em> § 14. Nonetheless, it seems that
            women who see themselves as important should recline while eating
            the Torah-mandated <em>kezayit </em>of matza and refrain from
relying on the opinion of Raavya. (This note appears in            <em>Peninei Halakha: Pesaĥ</em>, ch. n. 9.)

            According to Ritva, one may recite this <em>berakha </em>before or
after Nisan. This is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>, and<em>be-di’avad</em> one may rely on them, as explained in            <em>Yeĥaveh Da’at</em> 1:1 and <em>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot </em>
            15:8. Thus, this <em>berakha</em> is not time-bound. Even according
to those who maintain that it does depend on time (            <em>Turei Even</em> on<em> Megilla</em> 20b), this is not the
            standard case of "time dependence" because it depends on the
            appearance of blossoms in Nisan, which is why the Sages ordained
that it is recited in Nisan. That is also the view of            <em>Har Tzvi </em>OĤ 1:118 and <em>Ĥazon Ovadia</em> p. 8.
