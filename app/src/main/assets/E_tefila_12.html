    Chapter Twelve: Before the <em>Shacharit</em> Prayer
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. Greetings Before Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    From the time of <em>amud hashachar</em> it is forbidden for a person to walk to the doorstep of his friend, his father, or his rabbi and greet him with a
    hello or address him in any other way. If he does, he shows that he is ascribing more importance to that person than to <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, for
instead of standing in gratitude and in prayer before Hashem, he first goes to greet that person instead (<em>Berachot</em> 14a).    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    If a person passes someone's house, and a sense of common courtesy deems it appropriate that he enter to greet him, he is permitted to say "good morning"
    to him. He may not say "<em>Shalom</em>" since <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu's</em> name is "<em>Shalom</em>" and it is not proper to honor a human being with
    God's Name before praying (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 89:2).
</p>
<p>
    If he encounters someone along his way, according to most <em>poskim</em>, he is permitted to say "<em>Shalom</em>" since he did not intend to honor him.
    There are those who maintain that even in this case, it is better to say "good morning" and not "<em>Shalom</em>" so as to remind himself that he has not
yet prayed, and so that he will not be delayed by engaging in a secular conversation before prayer. That is the proper practice (see    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:16). If a friend who already finished praying met him on his way to synagogue and greeted him by saying "<em>Shalom</em>," he
    may respond "<em>Shalom</em>" even though he has not prayed (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:16).
</p>
<p>
    This prohibition only applies when one walks to his friend, father, or rabbi in order to honor him. However, for the sake of a mitzvah it is permitted.
    Therefore, if, for example, one's father needs to be accompanied to synagogue, one is permitted to wake up early, greet his father at his door and take him
    to synagogue. <em>L'chatchilah</em> he should say "good morning" to his father and not "<em>Shalom</em>."
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, if, in order to honor one's elderly parents who are about to depart on a journey, one must accompany and help them, and if he prays first he
    will arrive too late to help, he must first recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em>, and then escort them to the airport and subsequently pray. (His father will
    pray on the plane.) The same rule applies when one needs to greet his parents upon their return.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>

    2. One May Not Deal with Personal Business Before Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    From the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>, it is prohibited to deal with one's work before praying. This is because holy matters precede secular matters and
    the respect of Heaven precedes the needs of people. Therefore, it is necessary to first thank Hashem in prayer, and only afterwards deal with one's own
    needs. The <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Berachot</em> 14a), "Anyone who prays and afterwards goes on his way, <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu </em>grants him what
    he desires."
</p>
<p>
    It is preferable to pray individually before beginning to work, instead of praying in a <em>minyan</em> after he has begun to work. For example, if a
    person must start work at 6:30 a.m. and the only <em>minyan</em> in the area is at 7:30 a.m., it is better that he prays individually before work begins,
    so that he does not work prior to praying (<em>Mishnah Berurah </em>89:20).
</p>
<p>
    However, before <em>amud hashachar</em>, a person is permitted to deal with his work, for since the time of <em>Shacharit</em> has not yet arrived, he is
    not considered to be putting his needs before prayer. He must be strict in saying <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> before that, for the time to recite them is
    immediately upon waking up. Since he started his work before the time to pray began, he is permitted to continue even after <em>amud hashachar</em> on
    condition that he succeeds in praying before the time to pray lapses<em> </em>(<em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> 89:7; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:37;
    70:23).<button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. Permitted Activities Before Praying
</h2>
<p>
    It is permitted to engage in acts of a mitzvah before praying, for those are not one's personal wishes, but rather the desires of Heaven. For example, on
Friday, if after the prayer service there may not be enough food left in the store for Shabbat, it is permissible to buy food before praying (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 250:1; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 89:25). However, it is forbidden to buy even one item if it is not for the purpose of a mitzvah. If
    there is no food in one's house to give to his children who are leaving for school, he is permitted to buy the necessary foods before prayer, since that
    too, is considered an act performed for the sake of a mitzvah.
</p>
<p>
    Minor activities are not considered to be work, nor a fulfillment of one's own desires, and they are therefore permissible before prayer. For example, a
    person is permitted to make his bed before praying, and he is permitted to take the garbage from his house to the public garbage bin. Similarly, he is
    permitted to read the newspaper a bit and do a little exercise before prayer.
</p>
<p>
    Before praying, it is permissible to put laundry that is already sorted into the machine and turn it on, since this is considered a minor act. However, it
    is prohibited to sort the laundry and then put it into the machine (<em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2:5).
</p>
<p>
    It is forbidden to cook and bake before the prayer service; however, a person is allowed to ignite the fire under a pot that was prepared the day before,
    or to put into the oven a pan that contains food that was previously prepared.
</p>
<p>
    It is permissible in a time of need to dress children or to make them a sandwich before they leave for school, since this is a minor act and it also
    possesses an aspect of a mitzvah.
</p>
<p>
    It is permissible to compose innovative Torah insights, either by hand or on the computer, before the prayer service. However, it is forbidden to write
    secular ideas.<button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. Ritual Immersion (<em>Tevilah</em>), Bathing, and Shaving
</h2>
<p>
Included in the prohibition to engage in one's needs before the prayer service is the prohibition to get a haircut or to enter a bathhouse (<em>Rambam Tefillah</em> 6:7). However, to wash one's hands is an obligation. It is also proper to wash one's face and brush one's teeth before praying (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 4:17; 46:1).
</p>
<p>
    It is permissible to ritually immerse oneself in a <em>mikveh</em> before praying since there is no affront to the respect due to prayer. In fact, just the
    opposite is true - it is a preparation and purification towards it.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, it is permissible to take a shower before praying, since the washing of one's whole body in nine <em>kabin</em> of water, which is approximately
12.5 liters (approximately 3.3 US liquid gallons), also constitutes a preparation and purification towards prayer (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,    <em> Orach Chaim</em> 88:1; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:4; <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em> 4:21).
</p>
<p>
    According to a number of <em>poskim</em>, it is prohibited for the person who is bathing to wash himself with soap before prayer because that kind of
    washing is included among the types of prohibited bathing. However, in practice, one who feels that he is dirty and his intention is to become clean, and
not to pamper himself, may wash his body with soap on condition that he does not arrive late to the <em>minyan </em>because of this.    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, it is prohibited to get a haircut before prayer; however, regarding shaving there is uncertainty. There are those who say that shaving is
    included in the ruling against haircuts. However, it seems that the halachah is that a person who normally shaves every day is allowed to shave before
    prayer, since shaving for him is one of the regular morning waking activities and is not considered tending to one's own needs before prayer. It is
    especially proper to permit such an act if it is done as preparation for prayer.<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. One Who Is Traveling
</h2>
<p>
Before <em>amud hashachar</em> a person is allowed to travel, provided that he plans his departure in such a way that he will succeed in reciting    <em>Shacharit</em> on time. However, after <em>amud hashachar</em>, a person is prohibited from going on his way; instead, he must pray first and only then
    may he leave. Even if he has to leave home so early that he will miss praying with the <em>minyan</em> in his area, whereas he will still be able to pray
    in a <em>minyan</em> at his destination, it is preferable for him to pray individually before departing (<em>Mishnah Berurah </em>89:20).
</p>
<p>
    This prohibition refers to setting out on a long trip, for that is the meaning of "<em>yotzeh laderech</em>" (going on one's way). One interpretation
    maintains that the words refer to a journey that lasts at least 72 minutes (<em>Shut Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 7:6). In times of need one may rely on that
    opinion. Therefore, concerning a person who must start traveling earlier than the time of the <em>minyan</em> in his area, if his trip lasts less than 72
    minutes, it is preferable for him to leave and then pray in a <em>minyan</em> at his destination. However, if his trip lasts longer than 72 minutes, it is
    best that he pray first in his area individually.
</p>
<p>
    If the entire trip is for the sake of prayer, for example, traveling to recite <em>Shacharit</em> at the <em>Kotel</em>, one is permitted to depart before
    praying, even if the travel time will last more than 72 minutes, for he is traveling to pray and not for his own personal needs (<em>Or L'Tzion</em>
    there).<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Eating and Drinking Before Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    From the time of <em>amud hashachar</em>, it is forbidden to eat or drink before praying. The <em>Chachamim</em> support their words (<em>Berachot</em>
10b) on the verse (Leviticus 19:26), "Do not eat on the blood," which they interpreted as, "Do not eat before praying for your blood."    <button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button> Further, they teach, "Anyone who eats and drinks first and [only] afterwards prays, Scripture says of him
(I Kings 14:9), "You have thrown Me behind your body" ("<em>gavecha</em>," the word used for "your body," alludes to "<em>ga'avatecha</em>" - your pride).    <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> said, 'After this person acts arrogantly he accepts upon himself the yoke of Heaven?!'"
</p>
<p>
    However, water is a permissible drink before prayer because there is no aspect of pride in drinking it. Similarly, one is permitted to eat food and drink
    beverages that are intended for medication. Because they are being used as medicine, there is no aspect of pride in consuming them (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>
89:4). For example, someone who is suffering from constipation is permitted to eat prunes before prayer since he is eating them as medicine (see    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:24).
</p>
<p>
    Someone who is so hungry that he cannot concentrate on his prayer is allowed to eat before praying because the law regarding him is similar to that of a
    sick person who must eat; his eating does not possess any aspect of pride (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:4; see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 26).
</p>
<p>
A weak person, who is able to pray individually first and eat breakfast afterwards, but cannot delay his breakfast until after the time of prayer in a    <em>minyan</em>, should pray individually and eat after prayer. <em>L'chatchilah</em>, after the meal, it is good to go to the <em>minyan</em> in order to
    hear <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Kedushah</em> (<em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 89:3; see further in this chapter, halachah 7).
</p>
<p>
    A minor who has not yet reached the age of bar mitzvah is allowed to eat before prayer, for educating minors not to eat forbidden food applies when the
    food itself is not kosher. However, when the <em>Chachamim</em> "created a fence" not to eat before prayer, or before <em>Kiddush</em>, they did not
    obligate minors to abide by that "fence," since the food itself is not forbidden (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 106:5; <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 4, 12:15;
    however <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 106:11 is stringent).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. Coffee, Tea, and Cake Before Prayer
</h2>
<p>
    One who is used to drinking tea or coffee in the morning and whose mind remains unsettled without it, is permitted to drink it before prayer; his drinking
    does not possess pride, rather it is a necessity so that he can settle his mind and concentrate in prayer. There are some people who only feel a need to
    drink coffee two hours after they wake up, and therefore on weekdays when the prayer service is short, it is best that they do not drink coffee before
    praying. However, on <em>Shabbatot</em> and festivals, when the prayer service lasts a long time, it is better for them to drink coffee before prayer.
</p>
<p>
    Someone who cannot drink coffee or tea without sugar is allowed to add a little sugar in order to drink and settle his mind. If he can suffice with
    artificial sweetener, that is preferable; however, he should not add milk. One who cannot drink coffee without milk and whose mind will not be settled
    without coffee is permitted to add milk to his coffee.
</p>
<p>
    On Shabbat, many people are lenient and eat cake before the prayer service, but in actuality their custom is incorrect and they do not have on whom to base
    their practice. The only permissible consumption before prayer is coffee, for it is considered similar to water and because one who became accustomed to
    drink it has become addicted to caffeine and without drinking it, his mind is unsettled. However, eating cake is prohibited before prayer. Only someone who
    is so hungry that he cannot concentrate properly on his prayer, or one who thinks that later on he will be so hungry that his concentration will be
    disturbed, is permitted to be lenient and eat a small piece of cake before praying.<button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. Eating and Drinking Before <em>Amud HaShachar</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The prohibition of eating and drinking before prayer begins at <em>amud hashachar</em>, for that is the earliest time one may recite <em>Shacharit</em>.
    Regarding eating a meal the prohibition begins a half-hour before <em>amud hashachar</em>, lest he become so involved in his meal that he will forget to
    recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>. However, eating a snack is permitted before <em>amud hashachar</em>. Therefore, it is permitted to
    eat an unrestricted amount of fruits, vegetables, and cooked food before <em>amud hashachar</em>. Even eating an unlimited number of cooked foods made from
    various types of grain, such as pasta, is permissible before <em>amud hashachar</em>. However, bread and cake are permissible to eat only in an amount less
    than <em>k'beitzah</em> (like an egg), for that quantity does not constitute the eating of a meal (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>232:3; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    35; <em>Sha'ar HaTzion</em> 89:33).
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the half hour before <em>amud hashachar</em>, one is permitted to eat anything. Nevertheless, once <em>amud hashachar</em> arrives, all eating and
    drinking must cease (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:5; <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>27 and 29).
</p>
<p>
According to Kabbalah, some are accustomed to act stringently, maintaining that anyone who awakens after a regular sleep at night, even before<em>chatzot</em>, must not eat and drink until after praying <em>Shacharit</em>. Even though according to halachah it is permitted to eat and drink before    <em>amud hashachar</em>, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, it is proper to be cautious in doing so. However, if the lack of food will cause neglect of Torah learning,
    it is better to eat and drink before <em>amud hashachar</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:28). Similarly, those accustomed to waking up on Shabbat night to
    recite special prayers ("<em>bakashot</em>") are allowed to eat and drink, especially if that will help awaken them more to serve Hashem. (Those who follow
    Kabbalah are more stringent concerning this. See <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 89:28 and 43; see <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 5, 22:5-6).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. Tefillin and Tzitzit During Keriat Shema and Shacharit
</h2>
<p>
    It is a rabbinic obligation to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em> of <em>Shacharit</em> with <em>tefillin</em>, as written in the paragraph of <em>Shema</em>,
    "And you shall bind them as a sign on your arm and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes" (Deuteronomy 6:8). Similarly, it is written in the
    paragraph of <em>V'hayah Im Shamo'a</em>, "Bind them as a sign on your arm and let them be as frontlets between your eyes" (Deuteronomy 11:18). Thus, it is
    not proper to read these verses without <em>tefillin</em>. The <em>Chachamim</em> teach, "Whoever recites <em>Keriat Shema</em> without <em>tefillin</em>,
    it is as if he testifies falsely about himself" (<em>Berachot</em> 14b).
</p>
<p>
In any case, even one who does not have <em>tefillin</em> must recite <em>Keriat Shema</em>, since <em>tefillin</em> and <em>Shema</em> are two separate    <em>mitzvot</em> that do not prevent one another from being fulfilled. If he does not have the privilege to perform the mitzvah of <em>tefillin</em>, he
    must at least fulfill the mitzvah of <em>Keriat Shema</em>, and he is not considered one who gives false testimony, since he is in circumstances beyond his
    control (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 46:33).
</p>
<p>
    It is appropriate to pray the <em>Amidah</em> of <em>Shacharit</em> with <em>tefillin</em> as well; that is part of the complete acceptance of the yoke of
    Heaven (<em>Berachot</em> 14b).
</p>
<p>
    Regarding a person without <em>tefillin</em>, whose friend can give him his pair to put on after he finishes praying, the <em>Acharonim</em> are uncertain
    what is the best course to follow. Is it preferable for him to pray in a <em>minyan</em> without <em>tefillin</em> and then put on <em>tefillin</em>
    afterwards? Or should he pray with <em>tefillin</em> individually after the <em>minyan</em>? The opinion of most <em>poskim</em> is that in practice it is
best to pray with <em>tefillin</em> individually. However, one who wants to pray in a <em>minyan</em> without <em>tefillin</em> and then put on his    <em>tefillin</em> afterwards is permitted to do so.<button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
Likewise, it is proper to put on one's <em>tzitzit</em> before prayer because the third paragraph of <em>Keriat Shema</em> discusses the mitzvah of<em>tzitzit</em> and it is appropriate to recite it while actually fulfilling the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em>. It is also customary to hold the<em>tzitziyot</em> and kiss them a number of times while reciting <em>Keriat Shema</em> (see further in this book 15:11). Even though the mitzvah of    <em>tzitzit</em> can be fulfilled by wearing a "<em>tallit katan</em>"<em> </em>(<em>tzitzit</em>), it is also customary to put on a "<em>tallit gadol</em>
" (<em>tallit</em>) in honor of the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer. However, before marriage, most <em>Ashkenazim</em> suffice with wearing a    <em>tallit katan</em>. Only after they marry do they begin to wear a <em>tallit gadol</em> for <em>Shacharit</em>.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. Laws Pertaining to <em>Tzitzit</em> and <em>Tefillin</em> for <em>Shacharit</em>
</h2>
<p>
    A person's <em>tallit</em> is put on before his <em>tefillin</em>, for <em>tefillin</em> are holier than <em>tzitzit</em>, and it is proper to rise
    gradually in the levels of sanctity (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 25:1).
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the regular <em>kavanah</em> that one must have at the time that he performs any mitzvah, which is the intention to fulfill a mitzvah of
    Hashem, we learn in the Torah that the mitzvah of <em>tzitzit</em> is to remind us of all Hashem's commandments so that we may fulfill them. By performing
    the mitzvah of <em>tefillin</em> we are reminded to "enslave" our hearts and minds to the service of Hashem, and to remember His Oneness and the Exodus
    from Egypt (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 8:8; 25:5). These <em>kavanot</em> are printed in the <em>siddurim</em>, and although there is no obligation to say
    them, it is at least necessary to think them.
</p>
<p>
Those who want to enhance the mitzvah put on their <em>tallit</em> and <em>tefillin</em> at home and come to synagogue adorned in them (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 25:2). Even if this prevents them from being one of the first ten people to arrive, it is still preferable to put on one's    <em>tefillin</em> at home and come to synagogue wearing them (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:47).
</p>
<p>
    Because of the sanctity of <em>tefillin</em>, it is forbidden to let one's mind wander from them the whole time that he is wearing them. Therefore, one
    must touch his <em>tefillin</em> frequently (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 28:1).

            Although the time of the <em>Shacharit Amidah</em> starts <em>l'chatchilah </em>at <em>netz hachamah</em>, nevertheless, since <em>b'dieved</em> it
is permissible to begin praying from <em>amud hashachar</em>, the prohibition starts from <em>amud hashachar</em>, as writes the            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:8 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 12. Still, the <em>Taz</em> rules that the prohibition only begins at <em>netz</em>.

            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
89:25 writes in the name of the <em>Acharonim</em> that it is permissible to engage oneself in matters of a mitzvah before praying, as writes the<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 250:1. Accompanying one's parents or one's rabbi to synagogue falls under the category of a mitzvah.<em>Shut B'Tzel HaChochmah</em> 5:70 writes that one is also permitted to accompany them to the airport. He must be careful to recite<em>Birkot HaShachar</em> before that (based on what is brought by the <em>Orchot Chaim</em> and <em>Terumat HaDeshen</em> in the            <em>Beit Yosef</em>). (<em>Shevut Yaakov</em> 2:22 is lenient in any case about initiating a greeting to his father or rabbi, since the Torah
            commands us to honor them. Still, the <em>Pri Megadim</em> forbids it and so does the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:10).
        </p>
        <p>
The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:9 writes that even walking to his friend's seat in the synagogue is considered greeting him before prayer.            <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatash</em> 89:2 tends to be lenient. Bowing is also deemed a salutation (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:13).
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding calling someone on the phone, it seems that in times of need, one who needs to make a call is considered like one who passes by a
friend's house, in which case he is permitted to enter while refraining from saying "<em>Shalom</em>," but it is good that he recites            <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> before that. However, if there is no need, calling is forbidden, for then he is considered like one who greets his friend
            before prayer.

The <em>Rambam</em> (<em>Hilchot Tefillah</em> 6:7) writes that it is permissible to get a haircut and enter a bathhouse close to the time of<em>Shacharit</em>, meaning before <em>amud hashachar</em>. This is because <em>Chazal</em> only prohibited these activities close to<em>Minchah</em> time for that is when people normally perform such activities. That is how the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 89:7 rules. However, the<em>Ra'avad</em> maintains that this prohibition also applies within the half hour before <em>amud hashachar</em>, as explained in            <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> 70:5. Some say that the <em>Rambam</em> is lenient only concerning bathing and haircuts, for those activities are not
common before <em>Shacharit</em>, but regarding activities that are more commonly performed before <em>amud hashachar</em>, he is stringent (            <em>Pri Megadim</em> and <em>Derech HaChaim</em>). Most <em>poskim</em> are lenient concerning all activities. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:37
            slightly tends toward the opinion of those who are stringent and therefore writes that one must recite <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> before performing
            such activities, because after reciting <em>Birkot HaShachar</em> there are <em>poskim</em> who are lenient, as cited by the <em>Rama</em> 89:3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding a person who begins an activity after <em>amud hashachar</em> has already arrived, since he started when he was forbidden to do so, he
            must stop to recite <em>Keriat Shema</em>, for it is a biblical obligation. However, for the <em>Amidah</em> he does not need to interrupt; he can
            finish what he started on condition that he will succeed in praying on time (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 70:23).

89:3 presents a logical rationale that any ordinary or temporary work permitted on <em>chol hamo'ed</em> is also permitted before prayer.            <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2, notes 8 and 16, writes that this prohibition is a law based on precedence; one is forbidden to put his needs before
            praying. However, if the time of his regular <em>minyan</em> has not yet begun, he may be permitted to perform these activities despite the fact
            that <em>amud hashachar</em> has already arrived. It seems that in practice, one may be lenient regarding this when another doubt is added to the
equation. For instance, when there is doubt as to whether his activity is an ordinary activity or a mitzvah-related activity and the time of the            <em>minyan</em> in which he regularly prays has not yet arrived, it may be possible to be lenient.

            <em>Ishei Yisrael</em>
            13:21 writes that it is prohibited to wash oneself with soap. <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> 89:30 writes that it is not proper to shower, but if this helps
            him pray with <em>kavanah</em> and in cleanliness, it is permitted, though he should not use a lot of soap. <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2:8 rules that
            it is not proper to use soap. He explains that there is concern that soaping oneself will lead him to take a bath, which is forbidden. However, in
            paragraph 11 he writes that if the time of his regular <em>minyan</em> has not yet arrived, perhaps there is no prohibition to wash before prayer
            (as brought in the previous note).
        </p>
        <p>
            The essence of the rationale for leniency in this case is that in earlier times, ordinary bathing, to which the <em>Chachamim</em> refer, was known
            to last a while, was intended for enjoyment, and required lengthy preparations, such as starting a fire, heating the water, or walking to a
            bathhouse. However, a quick shower is done essentially to rid oneself of dirt and perhaps to invigorate oneself as well, and therefore there is no
            prohibition concerning it. Further, the <em>Rambam</em> (<em>Hilchot Tefillah</em> 4:3) writes that there is an obligation to wash one's face,
            hands, and feet before praying <em>Shacharit</em>. See <em>Beit Yosef</em> 92 who clarifies his source and although he writes that in practice it
            is not customary to wash one's feet, nevertheless we can learn from the <em>Rambam</em> that washing for cleanliness before prayer is considered an
            enhancement of the mitzvah. Additionally, according to the <em>Kolbo</em>, there is no prohibition against bathing oneself and getting haircuts
            before prayer, and only other activities are forbidden. His opinion is brought by <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 89:53. It seems
            that his reasoning is that bathing constitutes preparation in honor of the <em>Shacharit</em> prayer. Although we do not actually rule like him on
            the matter of bathing and haircuts, with regard to a short shower with soap, one may be lenient. In addition, when there is doubt concerning a
            rabbinic prohibition, the halachah follows the lenient opinion.

            The <em>Or L'Tzion</em> part 2, chapter 7:9 and <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 2:7 forbid shaving. However, <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em> 7:4, based on Rav
            Vozner, permits all routine activities that a person does every morning.

            <em>Avnei Yashfeh</em>
            14:20 writes that there are <em>poskim</em> who maintain that if along the way there are towns, this road is considered a road within a city. For
            that reason, it is permissible to travel on the road between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. According to him, it seems that this is true also when
traveling from Ashkelon to Nahariah, for communities are found all along the way. However, it is difficult to accept the opinion of these            <em>poskim</em> because any trip that lasts 72 minutes is certainly considered tending to one's personal needs before prayer. Perhaps only in
            extenuating circumstances is it permissible to rely on these opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
It seems that before praying,<em> l'chatchilah</em> a person should not even leave for a trip that lasts only half an hour. If there is a<em>minyan</em> in one's area, it is preferable to pray with it instead of traveling to his workplace to pray there, for there is reason            <em>l'chatchilah</em> to maintain that even a trip of half an hour is considered traveling before prayer, especially if that is the regular road he
            takes to work.

            According to the majority of <em>Rishonim</em>, the prohibition against eating before praying is rabbinic, and <em>Chazal</em> base this ruling on
            the verse cited above, as written by <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, <em>Ritva</em>, and <em>Meiri</em>. So, too, writes the <em>Beit Yosef</em>
            89:3, and according to his words the <em>Chachamim</em> permit all eating and drinking that do not possess an aspect of pride. According to his
            reasoning, the <em>Ra'avyah</em>, <em>Rosh</em>, and many others rule similarly. According to the <em>Ra'ah</em> and the <em>Ramban</em> (Leviticus
            19:26), the prohibition is biblical.

            Regarding coffee, see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 89:22, <em>Yabia Omer</em>, part 4, 11, and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 13:25. Concerning the consumption
            of cake before praying, although the <em>Bei'ur</em> <em>Halachah</em> 89:3 s.v. "<em>V'Chen</em>" writes that it is preferable to pray
            individually and not eat before prayer, it seems that a distinction should be made between a set meal and a snack. If he must have a set meal, it
            is preferable that he prays individually and eats after that. However, if it is enough to eat a snack, it is best that he eat a little and then
            pray afterwards in a <em>minyan</em>. That is the difference between what I wrote here and what I wrote in the previous halachah.
        </p>

See <em>Peninei Halachah Shabbat</em>, part 1, 6:9, that according to many <em>poskim</em>, among them the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>,            <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, and <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, one who eats before praying on Shabbat must recite <em>Kiddush</em> before he eats, although in
            practice, it is customary not to recite <em>Kiddush</em> before praying.

The <em>Magen Avraham</em> 66:12 is uncertain concerning this, and tends to resolve the issue by ruling that it is best to pray with            <em>tefillin</em> individually. So write the majority of <em>Acharonim</em>, including the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 66:40 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
            25:28. Still, there are those who disagree, and the <em>Minchat Yitzchak</em>, part 2, 107 writes that one may rely on them. <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>,
            part 1, p. 144 rules that if a person is unable to concentrate well, it is preferable that he pray in a <em>minyan</em> without <em>tefillin</em>.
            However, if he can have <em>kavanah</em>, it is better that he wear his <em>tefillin</em> while praying individually.
