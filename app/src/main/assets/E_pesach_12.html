Chapter Twelve: The Laws of Matza
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. The Mitzva of Eating Matza
</h2>
<p>
    It is a Torah commandment to eat matza on the night of the fifteenth of the month of Nisan, as it says, "In the evening, you shall eat <em>matzot</em>"
    (Shemot 12:18). Even though the Torah also says, "you shall eat <em>matzot</em> for seven days" (Shemot 12:15), the Sages inferred, based on the rules for
    interpreting the Torah, that the Torah does not mean to command us to eat <em>matzot</em> all seven days, but rather that matza is the staple food that we
    eat on Pesah instead of bread. However, one who wants to live off of fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products may do so.
</p>
<p>
    The simple meaning of this is that one who eats <em>matzot</em> all seven days of Pesah does not thereby fulfill a mitzva<em>.</em> This is what the Sages
    meant when they said (<em>Pesahim</em> 120a) that eating matza during the seven days is "voluntary" ("<em>reshut</em>"). Yet many leading halakhic
    authorities have written that although eating matza is obligatory only at the Seder, and indeed that is why the Sages instituted the special blessing over
    the eating of matza at the Seder only, nevertheless one who eats matza on the other days of Pesah still fulfills a mitzva, even if it is not obligatory. In
    this view, the Sages referred to eating matza on the remaining days of Pesah as a "<em>reshut</em>"<em> </em>only by way of contrast with the obligation to
    eat matza on the night of the fifteenth. According to this view, the verse "you shall eat <em>matzot</em> for seven days" retains its simple meaning. This
    is how Ibn Ezra and Hizkuni explained the verse, this is implied by a statement by Rosh, and this was the practice of the Vilna Gaon. However, even they
    maintained that the mitzva consists of eating a <em>kezayit</em> (olive's bulk) of matza at each meal, and that eating more does not add to the mitzva.

2. Shmura Matza
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah states, "And you shall observe (<em>u-shemartem</em>)<em> </em>the <em>matzot</em>" (Shemot 12:17). The Sages interpreted this to mean that the
matza must be guarded from becoming <em>hametz</em>. This refers specifically to the <em>matzot</em> eaten on the Seder night in fulfillment of the mitzva    <em>,</em> for the very next verse states, "in the evening you shall eat <em>matzot.</em>" The other <em>matzot</em> one eats on Pesah are like any other
    food: they may be eaten as long as there is no concern that they may have become <em>hametz</em>. However, we have been commanded to guard carefully the
    matza used for the mitzva on Seder night from becoming <em>hametz</em>. Such matza is called "<em>shmura</em>" matza.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, the wheat that will be used for the <em>matzot </em>should be guarded from when it is harvested. It is customary to harvest the wheat while it is
    still a bit moist, for if it were to dry out completely and then get drenched by rain, it would become <em>hametz</em>. Similarly, later on the grains must
    be stored where they will not come into contact with water.
</p>
<p>
    One may also fulfill the mitzva of eating <em>shmura </em>matza with <em>matzot</em> that were guarded from the time the wheat was ground into flour. As
long as the wheat kernels showed no signs of becoming <em>hametz </em>and nothing has happened that would undermine the presumption that they are not    <em>hametz</em>, one need not be concerned that they had become wet and became <em>hametz</em>. However, this is not the best kind of <em>shmura </em>matza
    since it was guarded only from the time of grinding.
</p>
<p>
    In extenuating circumstances, when flour that has been guarded from the time of grinding is also not available, one may buy regular flour and fulfill the
    mitzva by guarding the dough from the time of kneading (SA 453:4). Even where it is customary to rinse grains of wheat lightly before grinding them, it is
    still permissible in extenuating circumstances to buy regular flour in the market, since a brief rinse is presumed not to be enough to cause the grains to
    become <em>hametz</em>. However, where it is customary to briefly soak the grains in water, one may not buy flour for matza in the market, since it is
    presumed to be <em>hametz</em> (MB 451:24). Therefore, in practice, one should not buy flour that is not certified kosher for Pesah since the wheat is
    often soaked in water and may have become <em>hametz</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    In practice, today's custom is to be scrupulous about <em>shmura </em>matza; <em>matzot </em>that have been guarded from the time of harvest are used to
    fulfill the mitzva of eating matza on the Seder night. This practice has taken root so thoroughly that people have come to call matza that has been guarded
    only from the time of grinding "non-<em>shmura </em>matza," even though it is considered <em>shmura </em>halakhically, and one may use it to fulfill the
    mitzva of eating matza.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. Does the Guarding Have to Be with the Intent to Fulfill a Mitzva?    
</h2>
<p>
    Guarding the <em>matzot</em> to be used for fulfilling the mitzva of eating matza on the Seder night has two implications: being extra vigilant to prevent
    it from becoming <em>hametz</em> and having the intention that the matza is to be used for the mitzva ("<em>le-shem matzat mitzva</em>"). It is therefore
    necessary that the matza be kneaded and baked by Jews who are halakhic adults, who can be relied upon both to guard against fermentation and to keep in
    mind that their actions are for the sake of <em>matzat mitzva</em>. One may not employ gentiles, minors, or mentally unfit workers to knead or bake matza,
    since they cannot be relied upon to have the proper intent (<em>She'iltot,</em> Rashba).
</p>
<p>
Some dispute the second implication above. In their opinion, the mitzva of guarding the matza requires extra vigilance to prevent the<em>matzat mitzva </em>from becoming <em>hametz</em>, but requires no special intent while doing it. Thus, gentiles and minors are fit to bake<em>matzat mitzva</em>, as long as an adult Jew supervises their work, ensuring that they work with alacrity and that the dough does not become    <em>hametz </em>(Ra'ah).
</p>
<p>
In practice, at the time of kneading one should take care to fulfill both meanings of "guarding." Thus, one must insist that Jews knead and bake the    <em>matzat mitzva, </em>taking care that the dough does not become <em>hametz </em>and intending that the matza be for the sake of the mitzva. However, at
    the time of harvesting and grinding, the first meaning is sufficient. Thus, the wheat may be harvested and ground by gentiles as long as a Jew stands
    nearby and supervises their work, ensuring that it does not become <em>hametz</em> (SA 460:1; MB and SHT 4 <em>ad loc</em>.).
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Le-khathila</em>
, one should say out loud, when starting to work on <em>matzot</em>, that all the work is being done for the sake of producing <em>matzat mitzva</em>;<em>be-di'avad</em>, it is sufficient that he thought it (BHL 460:1, based on <em>Pri Megadim</em>). He should also have in mind that it is for the    <em> matzat mitzva </em>that one eats on Seder night, but if he had in mind that it is for matza for Pesah, he has fulfilled the obligation (SAH<em> </em>
    453:14).
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Handmade versus Machine-Made Matza at the Seder    
</h2>
<p>
    A great dispute has raged among <em>poskim</em> ever since the invention of matza-baking machines. The dispute centers on two principal questions: 1) Is
    there indeed no concern that machine-made <em>matzot</em> may become <em>hametz</em>?<em> </em>2) Can one use them to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza on
    the Seder night?
</p>
<p>
Concerning the question of <em>hametz</em>, it is agreed that everything depends on the nature of the machine and on its supervision. As long as there are    <em>kashrut</em> supervisors who ensure that there is no risk of <em>hametz</em>, the <em>matzot</em> are kosher for Pesah. Thus even the most pious and
    God-fearing Jews eat machine-made <em>matzot</em> on Pesah.
</p>
<p>
    The second question, however, is still debated. Some say that the mitzva of guarding the matza requires that the entire process of kneading and baking be
    done with explicit intent that they are <em>le-shem matzat mitzva</em>, and since a machine cannot have intentions, one would not fulfill the mitzva of
    eating matza on the Seder night with machine-made matza.
</p>
<p>
    Most <em>poskim</em> maintain that one can fulfill the mitzva by eating machine-made <em>matzot</em>, for several reasons. Firstly, some explain that the
    mitzva of guarding the matza only requires one to ensure that it does not become <em>hametz</em>, and it is irrelevant whether this is done while making
    the matza by hand or by supervising the activity of a machine. Furthermore, a human being operates the machine, and if he operates it with the intent of
    making <em>matzat mitzva</em>, then automatically all of the machine's operations are considered to have been done for the sake of the mitzva.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, machine-made matza may be used to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza on the Seder night. Many are scrupulous about fulfilling the mitzva with
    handmade <em>matzot</em> that were baked under proper supervision, although even they concede that it is not necessary to eat handmade <em>matzot</em>
    throughout the Seder meal. Rather, they beautify the mitzva by eating handmade matza for those <em>kezayit</em> quantities that constitute the mitzva (see
    below 16:22-25).
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. Is There Value in Eating Handmade <em>Matzot</em> All Pesah?   
</h2>
<p>
    The mitzva of guarding the <em>matzot</em> was stated about the <em>matzat mitzva</em> we are commanded to eat on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan. The
    idea is to honor the mitzva by guarding them especially carefully. In other words, <em>matzot</em> that were not guarded but about which there is no
    concern that they may have become <em>hametz</em> may be eaten on Pesah. They are just not fit for use as <em>matzot</em> <em>mitzva</em> since they were
    not guarded specifically for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, throughout Pesah, it is permissible to eat matza that is kosher for Pesah, even if it is not <em>shmura</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, some are meticulous about eating <em>shmura </em>matza throughout Pesah. There are two reasons for this: one is that some <em>poskim</em>
    maintain that while there is no duty to eat <em>matzot</em> throughout Pesah, one who does so fulfills a mitzva; therefore, one should eat <em>shmura </em>
matza. According to this, it is sufficient to eat a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>shmura </em>matza at every meal. Similarly, it is sufficient to use our regular    <em>matzot</em> (not labeled as <em>shmura</em>), which have been guarded from the time of grinding, because, as we have learned, one can fulfill the
    requirement for <em>matzat mitzva</em> with matza that has been guarded from the time of grinding.
</p>
<p>
    The second reason for eating <em>shmura</em> matza<em> </em>is concern about <em>hametz</em>. Out of all the foods we eat on Pesah, matza is the likeliest
    to become <em>hametz</em>. Therefore, if the wheat grains are not guarded from harvest time, there is concern that they may have become <em>hametz</em>.
    Thus, there is good reason to be stringent and to eat only matza that has been guarded from harvest time.
</p>
<p>
    Today, the advantage of <em>matzot</em> that have been guarded from harvest time is not only in their having been protected from contact with water since
    the grain was harvested. In general, much more care is taken throughout their entire manufacturing process. For example, the baking machines are stopped
    every eighteen minutes for a thorough cleaning. Thus these <em>matzot</em> benefit from a whole series of enhancements.
</p>
<p>
    In sum, regular <em>matzot</em>, which have been guarded from the time of the grinding, are kosher for all of Pesah, <em>le-khathila.</em> Even those who
    maintain that there is a mitzva to eat matza throughout the seven days of Pesah agree that one fulfills the mitzva with such <em>matzot</em>. Those who are
    more scrupulous eat <em>matzot</em> that have been guarded from harvest time, primarily because these <em>matzot</em> are more carefully guarded against
    becoming <em>hametz</em>.

<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. Water That Has Stayed Overnight    
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages prohibited kneading the dough for Pesah <em>matzot</em> with lukewarm water. Warmth accelerates the leavening process, increasing the risk of the
    dough becoming <em>hametz</em> if the workers are not especially quick in kneading and baking it. The Sages forbade kneading the dough even with regular
    cold water found in cisterns and in springs, lest the surrounding ground, which had absorbed the heat of the sun, in turn warmed the water. Therefore, they
    required that the water be drawn before nightfall and kept overnight in a cool place. Such water is called <em>mayim she-lanu</em>. This water is used to
    prepare <em>matzot</em> for Pesah (SA 495:1 and 3).
    <button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    However, a problem arose in countries with warm climates. No matter where the water was kept overnight, it would warm up a bit. On the contrary, had the
    water been left in the springs, it would have stayed cooler! Nevertheless, the <em>halakha </em>is that the water must be left out, as the Sages enacted.
    If, as a result, the water warms up a bit, it must be refrigerated (<em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> 2:7).
</p>
<p>
    Some maintain that one should leave tap water overnight for baking the <em>matzot</em>, since the water might be from an open reservoir and may have been
warmed by the sun. Furthermore, there is concern that the chlorine mixed into the water will accelerate the leavening process (<em>She'arim Metzuyanim Be-halakha</em> 109:3). In practice, this possibility is of no concern, and only a few meticulous people who make handmade    <em>matzot</em> are scrupulous about drawing the water from wells or springs. In machine-matza factories, they take regular tap water from the municipal
    system, filter it thoroughly, and leave it in a cool place all night (R. Zvi Yehuda Kook similarly would prepare <em>mayim she-lanu </em>from tap water).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. Preventing Leavening during Kneading    
</h2>
<p>
    The flour for <em>matzot</em> is ground at least one day before it is kneaded into dough, since the grinding heats the flour slightly, increasing the risk
    that the dough will become <em>hametz</em> (SA 453:9).
</p>
<p>
    No salt or pepper is added to the dough, since they might warm the dough, increasing the risk that it will become <em>hametz</em> (SA 455:5-6).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Le-khathila,</em>
    one should not make matza dough with more than c. 1.5kg (c. 3.3 lbs.) of flour (the <em>shi'ur </em>for having to separate <em>halla</em> from the dough
    with a <em>berakha</em>). It is hard for one person to knead such a large piece of dough thoroughly and quickly, and there is concern that parts of the
    dough may become <em>hametz</em>. <em>Be-di'avad</em>, if one kneaded a larger quantity, the matza is kosher as long as the dough did not rest for eighteen
    minutes and no signs of leavening appeared (SA 456:1-2).
</p>
<p>
    When there are several people engaged in kneading, flattening, and rolling out the dough, some <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is permissible to knead
    larger quantities, and indeed many do so. Even so, initially it is proper to be stringent and not to knead more than the measure that the Sages fixed (MB
    456:7).
</p>
<p>
    When the kneading is done by machine, it is customary, even <em>le-khathila</em>, to permit kneading large volumes of dough.
</p>
<p>
    One may not knead the dough in a hot place, since heat accelerates the leavening process. Therefore, one should not knead in a sunny place. Sometimes it is
    hot even on a cloudy day, so even if the sun is not shining, one should not knead the dough outside, nor inside next to windows, lest the heat radiate
    through them. Obviously one should not knead in a place warmed by an oven (SA 459:1). One authority put a number on this: one should not knead where the
    temperature is 30�C or higher (<em>Sefer Matzot Mitzva</em>, ch. 7, n. 29). <em>Be-di'avad,</em> if one kneaded dough in a hot place but did not see any
    signs of leavening in the dough or the matza, the matza is kosher for Pesah (SA 459:5).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Le-khathila</em>
    , one may not stop working the dough for even a moment (SA 459:2). If the hands of the person kneading the dough heat up, he should cool them in cold
    water. Some are scrupulous to cool their hands in water occasionally while they are kneading (MB<em> </em>459:27).
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. More Laws about Matza    
</h2>
<p>
    The oven should be heated thoroughly, so that the dough begins to bake immediately. If the heat is low, the dough might begin to become <em>hametz</em>
    before it bakes. Clearly one may not bake matza in the heat of the sun, and if he did so, then even if the heat was very strong and it is obvious that the
    dough did not leaven, one does not fulfill the mitzva of eating matza with it, as the Torah calls matza the "bread of affliction," and something sun-baked
    is not properly called bread (SAH 461:6).
</p>
<p>
    It is not necessary, however, to bake the bread specifically in the flames of the fire. Rather, even if the flames burn under a metal or earthenware plate,
    as long as the plate is burning hot, one may bake on it (SA 461:2).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, one may bake in an electric oven whose heating elements glow hot, for that is considered like fire. Matza baked in a microwave oven is
disqualified from being used in the mitzva of eating matza, since it was not baked by fire. Some say it is kosher, for no early source indicates that the    <em>matzot</em> must be baked specifically with fire (see <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> p. 335 - R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach disqualified such <em>matzot</em>,
    and R. Shaul Yisraeli held them to be kosher).
</p>
<p>
    One may not decorate matza with pictures, as it may become <em>hametz </em>during the delay caused by drawing. One may not make a thick matza (thicker than
    7.6 cm) on Pesah, out of concern that the fire will not reach the center and it will become <em>hametz</em> (SA 460:4-5). However, one may bake a matza
    that is a bit thinner than a <em>tefah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The Ashkenazic custom is to make the <em>matzot</em> thin and hard, so that the heat goes through them thoroughly and there is hardly any concern that the
    matza will become <em>hametz</em> (Rema 460:4). Some Sephardim bake matza that is about as thick as a finger, while others make them thin like wafers, as
    Ashkenazim do, since they usually bake them before Pesah, and if they were not wafer-life, they would not last long (<em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 460:44).
</p>
<p>
    One does not fulfill his obligation with a stolen matza (SA 454:4). Sometimes a purchaser takes the <em>matzot</em> into his possession without paying
    immediately. If the seller indicates that he wants to receive payment immediately, the purchaser must be careful to pay as the seller requested. If the
    seller seeks the buyer out, demanding payment for the <em>matzot</em>, and the purchaser dismisses him by saying "come back later," then the purchaser does
    not fulfill his obligation with those <em>matzot</em>, because they do not belong to him (MB 454:15).

            1. <em>Pesahim</em><em> </em>120a explains this based on one of the rules for interpreting the Torah, namely, that any item singled out from a
            class of items did not leave the class to teach a new idea only about itself, but to apply the new teaching to the entire class. In this case, the
            "class" is "you shall eat matza for seven days." However, the Torah says later on, "for six days you shall eat matza, and the seventh day will be a
            festival for the Lord, your God" (Devarim 16:8). Clearly, the "seventh day" was excluded from the general class in that there is no mitzva to eat
            matza on that day. This in turn teaches about the entire class - all seven days - that there is no mitzva to eat matza. Only on the night of the
            fifteenth, the Seder night, is there such a mitzva, based on the verse "in the evening you shall eat matzot" (Shemot 12:18).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Most Rishonim<em> </em>and Aharonim do not mention any mitzva associated with eating matza<em> </em>during the seven days of Pesah, implying that
            there is in fact no such mitzva. However, many Rishonim and Aharonim do actually mention such a mitzva, including: Ibn Ezra on Shemot<em> </em>
23:15, Hizkuni on Shemot 12:15, and <em>Responsa Rosh </em>3:23 citing the Ge'onim that one does not wear <em>tefillin</em> on<em>Hol Ha-mo'ed </em>Pesah, since there is already a "sign" on Pesah, namely, eating matza. So states MB<em> </em>475:45 in the name of Gra (            <em>Ma'aseh Rav �</em>185)<em>.</em> See <em>Ha-Seder He-arukh </em>I:78:7-14.

            . According to Rif<em>, </em>Rambam, and other Rishonim, the wheat needs to be guarded from the time it is harvested; according to Rosh, from the
            time that it is ground, since the mitzva only begins when the wheat encounters water, and the wheat was usually ground in water mills. The
            implication of Rosh's opinion is that as long as one grinds the wheat without using water, the mitzva of guarding the wheat begins at the time of
            kneading (MA<em> </em>453:7). However, several Rishonim write that the wheat needs supervision from the time of grinding regardless of whether a
            water mill is used; among them are Rashi<em>, Shibolei Ha-leket</em>, and <em>Smak</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to geonic responsa<em> </em>cited by many Rishonim<em>, </em>if one neglected to guard the wheat from the time of the grinding, he may
            purchase flour from the market <em>be-di'avad</em>. According to <em>Birur Halakha </em>40a, one may certainly recite the <em>berakha </em>over
            matza if it was guarded from the time of grinding (BHL 453:4), because according to Ran and many other Rishonim, the position of Rif<em> </em>and
those who agree with him is that guarding matza from the time of harvesting is merely the best way to fulfill the mitzva. According to <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim</em> 482:1, in an extreme situation one may even use matza<em> </em>that was only supervised from the time of kneading and recite a            <em>berakha</em> on it. It seems that most <em>poskim</em> concur that <em>be-di'avad </em>one may use matza<em> </em>that was guarded only from
            the time of kneading.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <em>Tur </em>
            and <em>Beit Yosef</em> state that according to Rif<em>, </em>Rabbeinu Yeruham<em>,</em> Ran, and <em>Magid Mishneh</em>, the need to guard the
            matza pertains only to the matza used to fulfill the mitzva on the first night of Pesah. All other matza eaten on Pesah need not be guarded (MB
            453:21). (Others maintain that one must use <em>shmura </em>matza for the entire holiday, either out of concern that non-<em>shmura</em> matza will
become <em>hametz</em> or because they believe that there is a mitzva to eat <em>shmura </em>matza all Pesah; see below, section 5.) According to            <em>Bah</em> and those who agree with him, the need to guard the matza is rabbinic in origin, and the rabbis merely supported their enactment using
a verse from the Torah. However, according to most <em>poskim</em>, this mitzva is from the Torah (BHL<em> </em>460:1 s.v. "ein", citing Rashba            <em>, Pri Hadash</em>, and other Rishonim and Aharonim).

            . According to most <em>poskim</em>, there are two implications of guarding the wheat: ensuring that it does not become <em>hametz</em> and
intending that it is for <em>matzat mitzva</em><em>.</em> According to Ra'ah, there is only one purpose: ensuring that it does not become            <em>hametz</em>. According to R. Hai Gaon and others, it is indeed necessary to intend to use the wheat for the mitzva, but if a Jew supervises a
            gentile or child and instructs him to knead the dough specifically <em>le-shem matzat mitzva</em>, we may rely on this for proper intent. SA 460:1
            follows the view of most <em>poskim</em> that the mitzva of guarding the wheat requires both aspects. Therefore, one may not use matza that was
            kneaded or baked by a gentile (MB 460:3, SHT <em>ad loc.</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
            According to <em>Bah</em><em> </em>and <em>Eliya Rabba</em>, those who believe that the guarding must begin at the time of the harvest (see the
            previous section) also require a Jew to harvest and grind the wheat <em>le-shem matzat mitzva</em>. Some are meticulous about this in practice.
            (According to those who maintain that turning on a machine does not constitute proper intent - see the next section - the harvesting and grinding
            must be done by hand, not with agricultural machinery; very few people insist on this.)
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <em>Taz</em>
            explains that the harvesting and grinding need not be done with the intention to use the wheat for a mitzva; therefore, one may have a gentile
            harvest and grind the wheat, provided that a Jew supervises and ensures that the wheat does not become <em>hametz</em>. Intentions to use the wheat
for the mitzva are only necessary from the time of kneading; therefore, a Jew must be the one to knead and bake the matza (according to most            <em>poskim</em>). Consequently, SA<em> </em>460:1 rules that gentiles may not perform the kneading or baking of the matza. BHL<em> </em>460:1 s.v.
            "ein"<em> </em>states that the universal custom is to be lenient in accordance with <em>Taz</em> to allow gentiles to harvest and grind the wheat
under the supervision of a Jew. This is also the opinion of <em>Hok Yaakov</em> and SAH 453:16. Matza<em> </em>that is made this way is called "<em>shmura mi-she'at ketzira</em>" - supervised from the time of the harvest. See <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 16 n. 19, which beautifully explains            <em>Taz </em>to mean that there are two types of guarding.

            . See R. Harari's <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> pp. 326-335 for a summary of the opinions. Originally, the machines were operated with more human input,
            which caused concerns of <em>hametz</em> and of breaking from tradition. After the machines were enhanced and improved, these concerns abated, but
the concern that operating the machine does not constitute intent remained and was even magnified. Among those who prohibit machine matza are: R.            <em> </em>Shlomo Kluger, R. Hayim Halberstam (the Sanzer Rebbe, author of <em>Divrei Hayim</em>), R. Yitzhak Meir Alter (the Gerrer Rebbe, author
            of <em>Hidushei Ha-Rim</em>)<em>, </em>R. Avraham Bornstein of Sochatchov (author of <em>Avnei Nezer</em>), and most of the great Hasidic leaders.
Even today, most Hasidic <em>poskim</em> tend to dismiss machine-made matza. Among those who permit are: the authors of <em>Sho'el U-meishiv</em>,            <em>Tiferet Yisrael</em>, <em>Ktav Sofer</em>, and <em>Arukh Le-ner</em>. Some <em>poskim</em> even prefer machine matza to handmade matza, since
there is less of a chance of the machine matza becoming <em>hametz</em>. This is the opinion of R. Meir Simha of Dvinsk (author of            <em>Or Same'ah</em>) and R. Shmuel Salant, the head of the Jerusalem rabbinical court<em>, </em>who personally ate machine matza as did the
            Lithuanian community in old Jerusalem. The main reason for preferring machine matza is that the most important dimension of guarding the matza is
            to ensure that it does not become <em>hametz</em>, and based on what they saw, machine matza was less likely to become <em>hametz</em>. R. Zvi
            Pesah Frank, cited in <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> 2:3, states that since gentiles and children are intelligent, a supervising Jew cannot supply proper
            intent on their behalf while they knead. A machine, on the other hand, has no intelligence, so the intent of the Jew operating the machine is
            effective. Thus, my teacher R. Zvi Yehuda Kook would eat machine-made matza at the Seder. R. Min-Hahar and R. Messas also preferred machine-made
            matza. R. Shaul Yisraeli stated that there is no preference for handmade matza<em> </em>over machine-made matza. According to R. Mordechai Eliyahu,
            even though one may recite the <em>berakha </em>over machine-made matza, handmade matza is preferable. (<em>Responsa</em> <em>Oneg Yom Tov </em>OH
            42 explains that even though the mitzva to guard the matza is from the Torah, if for some reason one does not have matza that was guarded for the
            sake of the mitzva, he still has a Torah obligation to eat matza<em> </em>on the Seder night, presumably with a <em>berakha</em>, even though he
            has not fulfilled the mitzva of guarding the matza.)
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            I have written that using handmade matza enhances the mitzva based on my father's reasoning. He explained that many things changed over the past
            few decades: the machines are more automated than ever, and it is thus questionable whether there is proper intent. Perhaps in the past, when more
            human input was necessary to operate the machinery, this problem was less of a concern, but today the machines operate at the touch of a button.
            Moreover, when all of the matza was handmade, there was a concern that the pressure to supply matza to the entire nation meant that matza bakers
            would not be sufficiently meticulous in their efforts to keep the matza<em> </em>from becoming <em>hametz</em>. The machines were a great solution
            to that issue. Nowadays, on the other hand, most handmade matza factories are extraordinarily scrupulous, to the point that the situation may have
            been reversed, and handmade matza is actually less likely to become <em>hametz</em> than is machine-made matza. Even though there is a consensus
            that the intent of the machine operator or the <em>kashrut</em> supervisor is sufficient, having the proper intent throughout the process (as is
            the case with handmade matza) enhances the mitzva. This is especially true if one bakes his own matza, since it is always better for one to fulfill
            a mitzva<em> </em>on his own rather than through an agent (this is indeed my father's custom - to bake his own <em>matzot mitzva</em>).

            5. The custom of the Vilna Gaon was to eat <em>shmura</em> matza the entire Pesah for two reasons. Firstly, he maintained that there is a mitzva to
            eat <em>shmura </em>matza all seven days, but in this regard he reasoned that it only needs to be supervised from the time of kneading. Secondly,
he was concerned about <em>hametz</em>, and, accordingly, supervision would be necessary from the time of harvesting. This is quoted in BHL            <em> </em>453:4<em>. </em>AHS 453:20-23 states that according to Rif<em> </em>and Rambam, there is a rabbinic mitzva to guard the matza<em> </em>
            from the time of harvesting to prevent it from becoming <em>hametz</em>; accordingly, this applies to all matza<em> </em>that one eats over Pesah.
            However, according to most <em>poskim</em> one need not eat matza that was supervised from the time of harvesting, and this is the implication of
            SA<em> </em>453:4 and MB <em>ad loc.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            It thus emerges that the primary enhancement of the mitzva is to guard the wheat against becoming <em>hametz </em>from the time of harvesting.
            Thus, the kernels are harvested before they dry out to prevent any concerns of rainwater potentially making them <em>hametz</em>. The kernels are
then stored in a dry place, preventing any kernels from puffing up or splitting, which would indicate that they have started to become            <em>hametz</em>. On the other hand, wheat imported from abroad, from which all other matza<em> </em>is made, sometimes contains kernels that have
already become <em>hametz</em>. Even though matza<em> </em>bakers are careful to purchase clean shipments, there is still a concern that some<em>hametz</em> kernels mixed in. And even though these kernels are <em>batel be-shishim </em>(because the matza is baked before Pesah, the            <em>hametz</em> is not <em>hozer ve-ne'or </em>on Pesah according to most <em>poskim</em>; see above 7:3-4), this matza<em> </em>is as ideal as
            that which is supervised from the time of harvesting. Since matza that was guarded from the time of harvesting is the best and most special, bakers
            are careful to perform all of the other steps in the most meticulous way possible: during baking, they stop the machines every eighteen minutes and
            clean them thoroughly; they constantly declare that they are working <em>le-shem matzat mitzva</em>; and they are more careful to supervise the
            entire process. Conversely, the trend with regard to non-<em>shmura </em>matza is to produce and sell it as cheaply as possible, so that the
            general public will be able to afford it. Therefore, only the mixers used for kneading are changed every eighteen minutes, but the rollers are
            cleaned while they are running. Although they are cleaned in a way that ensures that every part is cleaned every eighteen minutes, since the
            cleaning is done while the machines are running, it is more difficult to clean the machines thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Yet <em>shmura</em> matza<em> </em>is far more expensive than the regular matza (even if it is only guarded from the time of grinding the wheat,
            and can thus be used to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza according to those who maintain that there is a mitzva<em> </em>for the entire holiday).
            Some say that it is preferable to give charity to the poor or to support Torah study than to buy <em>shmura </em>matza. On the other hand, why
            shouldn't one who spends lavishly on furniture, clothing, and other luxuries spend extra money to fulfill <em>mitzvot</em><em> </em>in the best
            possible way? Ultimately, in practice, regular matza is kosher, and one may rely on the fact that the <em>kashrut</em> supervisors do their jobs
            properly. When it comes to fulfilling higher standards of <em>mitzvot</em>, one must decide if and how he wishes to go beyond the letter of the
            law.

            6. One who did not prepare <em>mayim she-lanu</em> should not bake matza using regular water. Rather, he should suffice with fruits, vegetables,
            and other foods for the rest of the holiday. However, if he otherwise will not have a <em>kezayit </em>of matza with which to fulfill the Torah
            commandment on the Seder night<em>, </em>he may bake matza using regular cold water, so that he does not neglect this mitzva (MB 455:36).
