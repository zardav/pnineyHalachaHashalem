    Chapter Three: The Place of Prayer
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
    1. The Mitzvah to Pray in a Synagogue
</h2>
<p>
When a person prays in a synagogue with a congregation, his prayer is heard (see <em>Berachot</em> 6a). Even someone who missed praying in a<em>minyan</em> has a mitzvah to pray in the synagogue, since it is a permanent and special place of holiness in where prayer is more accepted (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:9).
</p>
<p>
    However, when the <em>minyan</em> is held in a different place, it is preferable to pray with the <em>minyan</em> rather than individually in the
    synagogue. If there is a small <em>minyan </em>in the synagogue and a larger <em>minyan</em> elsewhere, although there is merit to praying in the company
    of many, the value of praying in a synagogue is greater (<em>Pri Megadim</em>; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:27-28).
</p>
<p>
    Every community has an obligation to fulfill the mitzvah of building a synagogue which will be their mini-sanctuary (<em>mikdash me</em>'<em>at</em>) and
    where people can pray in a <em>minyan</em>. As it is written (Ezekiel 11:16), "I have been for them a small sanctuary," and Rabbi Yitzchak interpreted,
    "These are synagogues and study halls" (<em>Megillah</em> 29a).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Reish Lakish</em>
    says whoever has a synagogue in his city and does not pray there is called a bad neighbor. Moreover, he brings exile upon himself and his descendants.
    Those who arrive early to synagogue to recite <em>Shacharit</em> and are late to leave after praying <em>Ma'ariv</em> merit long life (<em>Berachot</em>
    8a; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:11).
</p>
<p>
    It is a mitzvah to run to synagogue just as it is a mitzvah to run to perform every mitzvah, in order to express one's passion for matters of sanctity, as
    it says (Hosea 6:3), "We will race on in order to know Hashem." Likewise, when one leaves the synagogue, he should walk slowly, so that he not appear happy
    to leave the synagogue (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:12).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
    2. Establishing a Regular Place to Pray
</h2>
<p>
    It is a mitzvah to choose a synagogue and pray there regularly. One should not change his place of prayer needlessly. This was the custom of Avraham Avinu
    who designated a place to pray, as it is written (Genesis 19:27), "Avraham woke up early in the morning [to go] to the place where he had stood before
    God," implying that he had a regular place where he would stand before Hashem. The designation of a place of prayer illustrates that one's connection to
    Hashem is absolute. Everything else in the world can change, but one's connection to Hashem is the most permanent and stable reality and should therefore
    transpire in a permanent place. The <em>Chachamim</em> say, "Whoever assigns a set place to pray, the God of Avraham helps him, and his enemies fall
    beneath him" (<em>Berachot</em> 6b, 7b; see <em>Maharal</em>, <em>Netiv HaAvodah</em>, chapter 4).
</p>
<p>
    However, it is not sufficient to designate a synagogue in which to pray. According to most <em>poskim</em>, even within the synagogue, every person must
designate a permanent place to pray (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:19). The primary importance of establishing a place to pray pertains to the recital of the    <em>Amidah</em> prayer (<em>Ben </em><em>Ish Chai</em>, <em>Miketz</em> 4). When there are benches that move back and forth slightly, it is not necessary
    to measure one's seat in centimeters, rather the whole radius of four <em>amot</em> (approximately two meters; approx. 6.56 ft) is considered one place.
    However, when every person has his own chair, <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is best to sit specifically in one's regular seat and to pray the <em>Amidah</em>
    near it.<button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes a guest sits in the seat of one who prays in the synagogue regularly. If there is no reason to suspect that the guest will be insulted, he may be
    asked to move to another seat. However, if there is a chance he may be hurt, it is better to sit elsewhere instead of possibly humiliating him. Ideally,
    the <em>gabba'im</em> (synagogue coordinators) should greet the guests and find them seats.
</p>
<p>
    The mitzvah to establish a set place to pray does not obligate a Jew to live his whole life in the same location in order to continue praying in his
    designated seat. Rather, if a person needs to move to another home, or thinks he may be able to pray with more<em> kavanah </em>in a different synagogue,
    he should change his place of prayer, and choose a new regular seat for himself.
</p>
<p>
    If a <em>minyan</em> does not assemble in one's regular place of prayer, he should go pray elsewhere, for the virtue of praying in a <em>minyan</em> is
    more important than the virtue of establishing a regular place to pray.<button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button> If, while one is praying in his
    regular seat, his concentration is disrupted by children playing nearby, it is preferable to switch to a different seat for the duration of that prayer
    service (<em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 90:22; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 118).
</p>
<p>
A person who needs to recite <em>Shacharit</em> in one area and <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> in another and designates one place to pray    <em>Shacharit</em> and a different place for <em>Minchah</em> and <em>Ma'ariv</em> is still considered one who has established a place for prayer.
Similarly, one who needs to designate a place in one synagogue on Shabbat and in another on weekdays is still considered establishing a place for prayer (    <em>Halichot Shlomo </em>5, note 2).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
    3. In Which Synagogue Is It Preferable to Pray?
</h2>
<p>
    When a person chooses a permanent synagogue, he must take into consideration several factors. If the choice is between a <em>beit midrash</em> (study hall)
and a synagogue, it is better that he establish his place in a <em>beit midrash</em>, for it is holier, and prayers recited there are more accepted (    <em>Shulchan Aruch </em>90:18). Even when there are fewer people praying in the <em>beit midrash</em> than in the synagogue, the <em>beit midrash</em> is
    preferable (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:55). However, if he cannot assign a set seat for himself in the <em>beit midrash</em>, it is better that he
    designate a place in the synagogue.
</p>
<p>
When he has the option of praying in either of two synagogues, he should choose the one that offers more Torah classes, since it is considered more like a    <em>beit midrash</em>. In addition, it is preferable to join the congregation that places greater emphasis on Torah study.
</p>
<p>
If there are two synagogues, one in which many people pray and the other in which few pray, a person should prefer the one with many, for "    <em>B'rov am hadrat Melech</em>" ("In a multitude of people is a King's glory.") However, if it is difficult to hear the <em>chazan</em> clearly in the
    larger synagogue, it is better to choose a synagogue in which one can properly hear the <em>chazan</em> (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:28). Therefore, as a
    general rule, it is best that synagogues be as large as possible, so as to augment the respect of Heaven. Nevertheless, there is a limit, since when there
    are more than a few hundred congregants it is difficult to hear the <em>chazan</em> clearly.
</p>
<p>
    If in one synagogue people regularly chatter during prayer and in another they don't, a person should opt for the synagogue that shows more respect for
    prayer, for he will be able to concentrate better there (<em>Sefer Chassidim</em> 770).
</p>
<p>
    The most important element of prayer is one's <em>kavanah</em>. Therefore, above all other rules established by the <em>Chachamim</em>, the place in which
    one can personally concentrate better is the appropriate place to choose (see <em>Radvaz</em>, part 3, 472).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, it is proper for a person to pick a synagogue in which the congregation prays in his family's <em>nusach</em>. However, if he knows that in a
    different synagogue he will have more <em>kavanah</em>, he should choose the synagogue in which he can have proper<em> kavanah </em>(see further in this
    book 6:3).
</p>
<p>
    A person is rewarded for every step he takes on his way to synagogue. Therefore, even if the preferred synagogue is farther away from his house, he should
not be concerned with the trouble that it takes to walk there, because he is rewarded greatly for each step.    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
    4. One May Not Pray in a High Place
</h2>
<p>
    A person who stands before <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> in prayer should know that his life is dependent on Hashem's kindness, and should therefore stand
    before Him humbly. That is what the <em>Chachamim</em> meant when they said (<em>Berachot</em> 10b), "A person may not stand on a chair, on a stool, nor on
    any other high place and pray, because there is no haughtiness before the Omnipresent, as it says (Psalms 130:1), ï¿½From the depths I called You, Hashem.'"
    In contrast, a synagogue must be built on the highest location in the city, in order to confer respect and superiority to the synagogue (<em>Shabbat</em>
    11a; <em>Peninei Halachah Likutim</em> I 6:4). However, the person praying must stand before God in humility, and therefore standing on a high place is
    forbidden. The Talmud (<em>Ta'anit</em> 23b) relates a story about Rabbi Yonah who was known as a righteous person whose prayers were answered. When he was
    requested to pray for rain, he went to a low place in order to fulfill the words, "From the depths I called You, Hashem." There he prayed until he was
answered and rain began to fall. For that reason it is customary in some congregations to lower the <em>chazan</em>'s place, which explains why the    <em>chazan</em> is described as "descending before the ark."
</p>
<p>
    As a rule, the <em>Chachamim</em> prohibited an elevated place higher than three <em>tefachim</em> (24 cm; approx. 9.45 in) above the ground. However, in
practice, it is forbidden to pray even on a less elevated place, for two reasons. First, a person standing on a stepstool or rock, even only one    <em>tefach</em> in height, is worried about losing his balance and cannot have the proper<em> kavanah </em>while praying. Second, if the floor is even,
    elevating oneself on pillows, cushions, or anything else, suggests a sense of haughtiness and it is improper to pray in such a manner. Nevertheless,
    praying on rugs and mats which are normally laid out on the floor is permitted <em>l'chatchilah</em>. Likewise, whoever prays on uneven ground may stand on
the elevated parts, as long as they are not three <em>tefachim</em> higher than the rest of their surroundings.    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<p>
    A sick or elderly person who has trouble getting out of bed may pray in bed, even though it is elevated from the ground.
</p>
<p>
    If the high place stands on its own - for instance, it is wider than four <em>amot</em> by four <em>amot</em> (approximately two meters by two meters or
    6.56 ft x 6.56 ft) - one is permitted to pray on it, because it is not measured in relation to other places, rather it is considered its own domain.
    Therefore, when a synagogue has two levels, if the higher floor is at least four <em>amot</em> by four <em>amot</em>, it is permissible to pray on it.
</p>
<p>
    Even an area which is smaller than four <em>amot</em> is considered to be its own domain if it is surrounded by partitions, and it is permissible to pray
on it. This is the law regarding congregations in which it is customary to build a <em>bimah</em> (pulpit) in the center of the synagogue on which the    <em>chazan</em> stands. If the <em>bimah</em> is surrounded by partitions, or is larger than four <em>amot</em> by four <em>amot</em>, then it is
    permissible to pray on it, since we do not measure its height in relation to other parts of the synagogue. However, someone who prays there does not
    fulfill the enhancement of the mitzvah in the verse, "From the depths I called You, Hashem." Even so, these congregations prefer to build a <em>bimah</em>
for the <em>chazan</em> and forsake the enhancement of "descending before the ark" so that the congregation can hear the <em>chazan</em>'s voice clearly.    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
    5. One Should Enter Two "Doorways"
</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Chachamim</em> teach, "A person should always enter through two doorways in the synagogueï¿½ and then pray" (<em>Berachot</em> 8a). There are three
    interpretations of this statement and all were accepted as halachah (<em>Shulchan Aruch </em>90:20).
</p>
<p>
    The first explanation of <em>Chazal</em>'s words is that one must enter inside the synagogue at least a distance equal to the width of two small doorways
    (approximately 64 cm or 25.2 in), since one who prays next to the entrance makes it seem that prayer is a burden to him and that he is standing there in
    order to leave immediately (<em>Rashi</em>). However, if a person's permanent seat is near the entrance, he is permitted to pray there, for everyone knows
    that that is his spot and he is not standing there in order to exit quickly (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Based on this, it is clear that <em>l'chatchilah</em> one should not pray in the entrance hall of the synagogue, for if <em>Chazal</em> say not to pray
    inside the synagogue near the entrance, all the more so, one should not pray in the hallway adjacent to it.
</p>
<p>
The second explanation is that one should not sit close to the entrance, so as not to look outside and be distracted from ones prayers (    <em>Maharam of Rotenberg</em>). Accordingly, it is also not proper to sit next to a window facing outside.
</p>
<p>
    The third explanation is that the person coming to pray must pause a few seconds, equivalent to the amount of time it takes to enter two doorways, before
    beginning to pray, in order to devote his thoughts to prayer (brought by the <em>Rosh</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, <em>Chazal</em>'s words here allude to two spiritual doorways through which a person must pass before he starts praying. In the first
doorway, he must rid his mind of worldly matters troubling him, and in the second doorway, he must direct his<em> kavanah </em>to serving Hashem (see    <em>Maharal Netiv HaAvodah</em>, chapter 5).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
    6. Nothing Should Separate a Person from the Wall While Praying
</h2>
<p>
    Ideally there should be nothing standing between a person praying the <em>Amidah</em> and the wall, so that nothing distracts him from praying. Permanent
furniture standing against the wall, such as a cupboard, is not considered to be a partition, and <em>l'chatchilah</em>, one may pray next to it (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:21; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 63:65).
</p>
<p>
Pieces of furniture which were made for praying purposes, like tables and <em>shtenders</em> (lecterns), are not considered partitions (    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:66).<button type="button" id="1006" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 6</button>
</p>
<p>
    There are those who say that people can also be considered partitions. However, this opinion is nothing more than an enhancement of the mitzvah, for it is
    impossible for all the congregants in the synagogue to pray facing a wall (see <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>90:69). Rav Avraham Yitzhak HaCohen Kook,
interpreted this ruling as not to pray behind a person who is not engaged in prayer; however, praying behind one who is engaged in prayer is permitted    <em>l'chatchilah</em> (<em>Tov Ra'ayah Berachot</em> 5b).
</p>
<p>
    It is not proper to pray in front of artwork lest it be a distraction (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:23). Therefore, the synagogue wall across from which
    people pray should not be decorated with artwork. However, if the artwork is above eye level it is permitted, for then there is no concern that people will
    be distracted by it while praying (<em>Magen Avraham</em> 90:37; <em>Mishnah Berurah </em>71).
</p>
<p>
    It is permissible to decorate the <em>parochet</em> (curtain) and the <em>aron</em> <em>kodesh</em> in the accepted manner, for people are accustomed to
    the decorations on them and the artwork does not distract them from praying.
</p>
<p>
    It is forbidden to pray in front of a mirror, so as not to appear as one who is bowing down to his own image. Therefore, even if a person were to close his
    eyes, it is still forbidden to pray in front of a mirror (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 71). <em>L'chatchilah</em>, one should not pray at night in front of a
    window in which his image is reflected, since looking at his image will likely disturb his<em> kavanah</em>. However, if he were to close his eyes or look
    into the <em>siddur</em>, he would be permitted to pray there. Since the window does not reflect his image clearly, he does not appear to be bowing down to
his reflection. In any case, it is good to install curtains over the windows facing the people praying, in order to cover the windows before the    <em>Ma'ariv </em>service.<button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
    7. One May Not Pray Near His Primary Rabbi
</h2>
<p>
    A person may not recite the <em>Amidah</em> prayer too close to his primary rabbi, for if he prays alongside him, he presents himself as his rabbi's equal.
    An even greater prohibition exists against praying in front of one's rabbi, so as not to appear arrogant (<em>yohara</em>). Nor may one pray behind his
    rabbi, for should the rabbi finish praying before he does, the rabbi will feel uncomfortable when he cannot take three steps backwards. Furthermore, the
    student may appear as though he is bowing down to his rabbi (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:24; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 74).
</p>
<p>
    Who is considered a person's primary rabbi? The one who teaches him most of his wisdom.<button type="button" id="1008" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 8</button> The same ruling
    applies in relation to a prominent Torah leader of the generation.
</p>
<p>
    If the student distances himself by four <em>amot</em> (approximately two meters or 6.56 ft), it is permissible. However, if he prays behind his rabbi, he
    must distance himself four <em>amot</em> and another three steps (approximately 60 cm or 23.62 in), so that even if he were to extend his prayer, his rabbi
    would be able to take three steps backwards.
</p>
<p>
    There are those who say that all these rulings refer to a situation in which the rabbi and his student are praying individually, or in a congregation where
    the student is the one who chooses to pray next to his rabbi. But if the <em>gabba'im</em> seat the student near his rabbi, or if that is the only vacant
    seat left in the synagogue, he is allowed to pray there, and there is no question of arrogance on the part of the student. In extenuating circumstances,
one may rely on this opinion, but <em>l'chatchilah</em>, a person should try not to establish his seat close to his rabbi.    <button type="button" id="1009" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 9</button>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
    8. A Proper Place to Pray
</h2>
<p>
    One should pray in a room with windows, and <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is good that a window facing Jerusalem be open (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:4). When
    someone is in a place with no windows, he should pray in a well-lit place, since some explain that the reason for praying in a room with windows is that
    the light settles the thoughts of the person praying (<em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>).
</p>
<p>
    In a synagogue, there are those who enhance the mitzvah by building twelve windows (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:4). The windows should be high, so that it
    is possible to see the sky and not see things that may distract people from the prayer service.
</p>
<p>
    A person should not recite the <em>Amidah</em> in open areas, and one who prays in an open place is called insolent (<em>Berachot</em> 34b). The reason for
this is that in an open area one's thoughts scatter, and in a closed and modest place the King's awe is upon him, and his heart is humbled (    <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:5). Furthermore, in an open space, people may pass by him and disturb his concentration.
</p>
<p>
    Those who are traveling are allowed to pray along their way, and if there are trees there, it is better to pray between them (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em>
    90:11). Similarly, it is preferable to pray next to a wall and not in a completely open area (<em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em> 90:5). It is even better to
    pray in a courtyard surrounded by walls, since the main principle is to have a nearby partition, even without a ceiling (<em>Mishnah Berurah </em>90:12).
</p>
<p>
    One may pray in the plaza of the <em>Kotel</em> (the Western Wall) because it is surrounded by walls on three sides. Moreover, the exalted holiness of the
    site strengthens one's love and awe of Hashem causing one's prayer to be said with more<em> kavanah</em>. Yitzchak Avinu practiced this way as well. He
    recited <em>Minchah</em> on Mount Moriah, the gateway of prayer, which was then an open field, as it says, "Yitzchak went out to meditate in the field"
    (Genesis 24:63; <em>Berachot</em> 26b).
</p>
<p>
    When it is not possible to pray in a synagogue, for instance, when it is occupied by a different <em>minyan</em>, it is permitted to pray behind the
    synagogue, on condition that one faces the direction of the synagogue and Jerusalem. It is also permitted to pray alongside the synagogue when facing
    Jerusalem. However, it is forbidden to pray in front of the synagogue because if he faces the direction of Jerusalem, his back will be disrespectfully
    turned towards the synagogue, and if he faces the synagogue, his back will be turned to Jerusalem (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:7).
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
    9. Areas Free from Excrement and Foul Odors
</h2>
<p>
    It is forbidden to say or think matters of sanctity in a place that contains feces or other foul smells, as it is written (Deuteronomy 23:14-15), "You will
    return and cover your excrement. This is because God your Lord walks among you in your campï¿½Your camp must therefore be holy." This law consists of many
    details, and we will learn a few of them.
</p>
<p>
    Anything within four <em>amot</em> (approximately two meters or 6.56 ft) of a person is considered to be within the confines of his camp. Hence, if there
    is excrement in his four <em>amot</em>, his camp is not holy and he is forbidden to pray there. If the excrement is in front of him, as long as he sees it,
he is not allowed to pray. If the smell spreads, he must distance himself by four <em>amot</em> from where the smell ends.    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button> Even one whose sense of smell is impaired is required to distance himself like others who smell the
    odor (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 79:1).
</p>
<p>
    The above law regarding human excrement applies to anything rancid whose stench causes people to be revolted. Therefore, one must distance himself from a
    carcass and from malodorous animal excrement, just as he must distance himself from human feces (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 79:23). Foul-smelling vomit
follows the same law as excrement. But if the vomit does not smell bad, there are those who are lenient and do not consider it like feces (see    <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 76:20 and <em>Ishei Yisrael</em> 51:12).
</p>
<p>
    If a person recited <em>Shema</em> or the <em>Amidah</em> within four <em>amot</em> of feces, he did not fulfill his obligation and the <em>Shema</em> or
    the <em>Amidah</em> must be repeated.<em> </em>Even if he was unaware that there was excrement there, but there was a fair chance that the place would
    contain excrement, and he neglected to check its cleanliness before beginning to pray, he did not fulfill his obligation. However, if the place was
    unlikely to contain excrement, <em>b'dieved</em> he fulfilled his obligation (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 76:8; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 31).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>poskim</em> are divided regarding a person who recited the <em>berachot</em> of <em>Keriat</em> <em>Shema </em>and other <em>berachot</em> within
    four <em>amot</em> of excrement. Some say that because he transgressed a biblical prohibition, he did not fulfill his obligation and he must go back and
    recite the <em>berachot</em> again (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 185:7; <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> there). Others maintain that it is only necessary to be
    stringent concerning the recital of <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Amidah</em>, but concerning other <em>berachot</em>, <em>b'dieved</em> he fulfilled his
    obligation (<em>Chayei Adam </em>3:33; <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 5:10; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 76:37, 185:14). Since it is a matter of dispute, one may
    not go back and repeat the <em>berachah</em>.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h2>
    10. Additional Laws
</h2>
<p>
    A person is permitted to pray facing the bathroom, as long as the door is closed and no foul odor reaches him. However, if the door is open, he is
    prohibited from praying there (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 83:5).
</p>
<p>
    Feces of young infants do not emit a stench and therefore the law regarding them is unlike that of excrement. When a child reaches the age that he can eat
    a <em>kezayit</em> (an olive's volume of food) produced from grain in the amount of time it takes to eat half a loaf of bread (approximately 6-7 minutes),
    it is necessary to distance oneself from his excrement, just as one is obligated to do regarding an adult's feces (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 81:1). There are
    those who write that this starts at one year of age. All this pertains to extenuating circumstances; <em>l'chatchilah</em> it is good to distance oneself
    from the excrement of a baby of any age, even one who is eight days old (<em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 81:3; <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 1:6).
</p>
<p>
    When praying near a baby at least one year old who defecates in his diaper, it is proper to initially verify that no foul odor is present. As long as no
    foul odor exists, it is permissible to pray next to him, for even if he did defecate, since he is covered in a diaper and clothing, and no scent reaches
    the person reciting matters of sanctity, there is no prohibition to pray there (see <em>Halichot Shlomo</em>, <em>Tefillah</em> 20:4-5). If a bad smell did
    reach the one praying and despite this he continued to pray, he must go back and repeat his prayer.
</p>
<p>
    At times, a sewer near the synagogue emits a bad smell which may reach the synagogue, in which case it is prohibited to pray inside. Occasionally, closing
    the windows that face the sewer helps, but when the foul odor lingers, spraying air freshener can be used to eliminate it. In the past, people would offset
    the smell by burning a garment (<em>Kaf HaChaim </em>79:20).
</p>
<p>
    The laws concerning distancing oneself from different odors depend on the accepted local norms. In the past, sewage, including feces and urine, would flow
    down the sides of the streets and the air in the densely populated cities was full of foul odors. Even so, prayers would be recited in the synagogues and
    in the houses near the sewage canals. Because everyone was accustomed to them, those routine smells were not considered foul. Only on summer days, or when
    the sewage canals were blocked, would the foul odor intensify and people would not pray where it existed (see <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 79:5). However,
    nowadays, sewage is drained, the air is purer, and we are more sensitive to bad smells, hence, wherever we sense a foul odor by today's standards, it is
    forbidden to pray.
</p>
<p>
    In rural areas with barns, the smell that wafts from the barns to the houses and the synagogue is not offensive to those who live there. However, in the
    city, this odor may be considered foul, and it would be prohibited to pray as long as it persists. Those who are guests in communities like these should
    follow the custom of the place.
</p>
<p>
    People who pray outside must be careful not to pray in close proximity to garbage bins that smell. Even when the garbage cans do not emit a foul odor, it
    is proper not to pray within four <em>amot</em> of them or when they are directly in front of the person.

    11. The Prohibition of Reciting Matters of Sanctity in Front of "<em>Ervah</em>"
</h2>
<p>
    It is prohibited to recite matters of sanctity in front of <em>ervah</em> (nakedness), as it says (Deuteronomy 23:15), "Your camp must be holy. Let Him not
    see any <em>ervah</em> among you and turn away from you." Regarding a man who sees another man, or a woman who sees another woman, it is prohibited to
    recite matters of sanctity only in front of the specific organs of <em>ervah</em> itself (the private organs). However, concerning a man who sees a woman,
    the <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Berachot</em><strong> </strong>24b), "A <em>tefach</em> of a woman is considered <em>ervah</em>." What they meant is that
    it is forbidden to reveal any part of a woman's body which is normally covered, and that if a part is exposed, one is prohibited from reciting matters of
sanctity in front of it. (The specifications of this law are explained in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,<em> Orach Chaim section</em> 75 and in    <em>Penieni Halachah</em>, <em>Likutim</em> <em>Mishpachah</em> 6:3-6).
</p>
<p>
Although we must educate girls to dress modestly starting from a young age, the prohibition against reciting matters of sanctity in front of a    <em>tefach</em> that is normally covered begins from the time the girl starts to mature.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, regarding the hair on one's head, the <em>Chachamim</em> teach (<em>Berachot</em> 24a), "A woman's hair is <em>ervah</em>." This refers to a
    married woman, for if her hair is not covered, one may not recite matters of sanctity before her. (The specifications concerning the laws of hair covering
    are clarified in <em>Peninei Halachah</em>, <em>Likutim</em> <em>Mishpachah</em> 6:14-15.)
</p>
<p>
    Regarding one who must pray, recite <em>berachot</em>, or learn Torah, and there is a woman facing him who is revealing a <em>tefach</em> of areas that are
    normally covered, <em>l'chatchilah</em>, he should turn away so that he cannot see her. If he cannot turn away, he must look into his <em>siddur</em>, or
    close his eyes, and only then say the matters of sanctity (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 75:6; <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>,<em> </em>paragraphs 1 and 29).
</p>
<p>
    Concerning hair covering, some <em>Acharonim</em> write that since, unfortunately, many married woman do not cover their hair, uncovered hair does not
    arouse impure thoughts, and <em>b'dieved</em> one may recite matters of sanctity in front of it. This only pertains to hair, regarding which the rule is
    more lenient than other normally covered parts, as single women are not obligated to cover their hair. However, concerning the normally covered parts of
    the body, as we have learned, one may not be lenient. Only in extenuating circumstances may one close his eyes or look in a <em>siddur</em> without looking
    at the exposed part (<em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 75:7; <em>Ben Ish Chai</em>, <em>Bo</em> 12; <em>Igrot Moshe</em>, part 1, 44; see <em>Peninei Halachah</em>
    , <em>Likutim</em> <em>Mishpachah</em> 6:16).
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, one may not recite matters of sanctity near a woman who is singing (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 75:3). However, according to some <em>Acharonim</em>
    ,<em> b'dieved</em>, hearing a female singer on the radio does not prohibit reciting matters of sanctity (see <em>Peninei Halachah</em> ibid., 6:11).

            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:60, based on the <em>Magen Avraham</em>, writes that within four <em>amot</em> is considered one place, because
            ones place cannot be measured exactly. However, it seems that when each person is assigned his own specific seat, the feeling of the permanent
            place pertains to that particular chair, as is written in the responsa of <em>Yosef Ometz</em>, 30. Nonetheless, if a guest takes a person's place
            and there is an empty seat next to him, in order not to make the guest feel bad, he should sit in the empty seat alongside the guest, since as long
            as he is within four <em>amot</em>, he is considered to be sitting in his regular seat.

            However, the <em>Eshel Avraham Butshatsh</em>, Tinyana Edition, 90:19, is uncertain about this ruling. In extenuating circumstances, one may rely
            on that uncertainty and pray in his permanent place rather than in a <em>minyan</em>. Also see <em>Halichot Shlomo</em> 5:2, who writes that if a
            person is late for prayer, it is preferable that he skip <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em> in order to pray in his regular synagogue, instead of going to a
            different place where he could pray all of <em>Pesukei d'Zimrah</em>.

We learn about the reward gained for steps taken to come to pray from the story of a widow who walked to Rabbi Yochanan's distant            <em>beit midrash</em> (<em>Sotah</em> 22a). It is implied from many <em>Acharonim</em>, among them the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:37, that if a
            person has to choose between two synagogues, all things being equal, there is an enhancement of the mitzvah in opting for the one farther away in
            order to merit the reward for steps taken. However, some <em>Acharonim</em> write that only if the farther synagogue is preferable anyway - whether
            it is because it has more people, or because it is a <em>beit midrash</em>, or because he can concentrate better there - he gains the reward for
            steps taken to walk there. However, when there is no advantage in going to the farther one, he does not receive reward for his steps taken to walk
            there (<em>Petach Einayim</em>, <em>Sotah</em> 22a; <em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 5:19; <em>Maharshag</em> 1:27).

The <em>poskim</em> are divided regarding whether or not it is permitted to stand on a utensil, bench, or anything similar, less than three            <em>tefachim</em> high. The <em>Bach</em> and <em>Taz</em> say it is allowed, while <em>Mahari Abuhav</em>, <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em>, and others
            maintain that it is prohibited. See the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:2 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 3. According to all <em>poskim</em>, when there is a
            feeling of fear and instability one may not pray. If he is on cushions and pillows most <em>poskim</em> say it is prohibited because it looks like
            haughtiness, as brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 614:9 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 21, and even the <em>Bach</em> agrees with this. When the
            ground is not level, there is no prohibition against praying on any spot lower than three <em>tefachim</em> as long as there is no feeling of
instability. <em>B'dieved</em>, even one who prays on a high place (more than three <em>tefachim</em>) fulfills his obligation, as explained by the<em>Pri Megadim</em>, <em>Mishbetzot Zahav</em> 90:1, based on the <em>Rambam</em>. According to this, it is clear why the law permits the            <em>chazan</em> to stand on a chair and make his voice heard when necessary (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 90:1).

            <em>Kaf HaChaim</em>
90:14 writes that according to the <em>Rambam</em>, the <em>bimah</em> must be surrounded by four partitions, and according to            <em> Ben Ish Chai</em>,<em> Yitro</em> 3, three are sufficient. The <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 90:3 writes that even if it is only surrounded by
            partitions on two sides, it is permissible to pray there, for it looks like a place of its own.

            <a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>
            The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:64 writes that even if the object separating the person from the wall is at a distance of four <em>amot</em> from
him, it is still considered a partition. However, according to the <em>Pri Megadim</em> and the <em>Magen Giborim</em>, it is not. The            <em>Rama</em> 90:20 holds that only something higher than ten <em>tefachim</em> (80 cm; approx. 31.5 in) and wider than four <em>tefachim</em> (30
            cm; approx. 11.81 in) can be considered a partition. The <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> writes in the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> that even
something smaller than that is a partition. The <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 68 cites the opinions of the <em>Pri Chadash</em> and            <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> who also disagree with the <em>Rama</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding what the <em>Taz</em> writes, that all furniture connected to prayer are not considered partitions, the <em>Or</em> <em>L'Tzion</em>,
            part 2, 7:10, writes that this is true only when they are being used for prayer. However, if a person is not using the <em>shtender</em> in front
            of him, it is indeed considered a partition. Nevertheless, it is customary not to rule this way since <em>shtenders</em> are made to be used in
            prayer and they are considered permanent furniture, as written in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:68.

The source for not praying in front of a mirror so as not to appear as bowing down to his own image is in the <em>Radbaz</em> 106. Many<em>Acharonim</em> cite it, including the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 90:71 and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 138. However, <em>Maharsham</em> in            <em>Da'at Torah</em> 90:23 is uncertain regarding this prohibition because when praying in front of a mirror, one's reflection is also bowing down
            to him, and therefore he is lenient in extenuating circumstances. As for a window in which the reflection of a person's image is not clear, even
according to the <em>Radbaz</em>, there is no prohibition. So writes <em>Or L'Tzion</em>, part 2, 7:11 and this is what we practice as well. See            <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 2, pp. 227-229.

His primary rabbi is the person from whom he gained most of his wisdom. The <em>Rambam</em> implies that this means most of his Torah learning.            <em>Maharik</em> 169, explains that the person who showed him the path of truth and integrity and taught him how to decide halachic issues is
            considered his primary rabbi. The <em>Shach</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah</em> 242:12, based on the <em>Rivash</em> and the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>,
explains that a person can have a number of primary rabbis in different areas of Torah, such as <em>Tanach</em>, <em>Gemara</em>, and            <em>Agadah</em>. Similarly, the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 242:19 writes that a person can have a few primary rabbis, one that taught him his
            comprehensive knowledge, and another, his sharpness, and a third, how to bring matters to a proper halachic conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The responsa of <em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 2:74 clarifies that the entire distinction between a primary rabbi from whom one gained most of his
            knowledge and a non-primary rabbi only applies when he is not learning from him, but during the time period that a person is learning from a
            certain rabbi, that teacher has the status of his primary rabbi. According to this, the <em>rosh</em> <em>yeshivah</em> and the <em>ram</em> who
teaches him are thought of as his primary rabbis (see the <em>Rama</em>,<em> Yoreh De'ah </em>242:6). Consequently, the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>,            <em>Yoreh De'ah</em> 242:29, writes that a primary rabbi who has been appointed the <em>mara d'atra</em>, the local rabbi to teach and to judge, is
            considered by the people of that place to be the primary rabbi.

            The <em>Rama</em> 90:24 mentions the opinion of the <em>Sefer HaMeorot</em> and <em>Ohel Mo'ed</em> who say that when his permanent seat is near
            his rabbi, it is permissible. In practice, the <em>Rama</em> writes that it is good to be stringent and not to pray behind one's rabbi, in order
not to cause him grief. However, the custom is to be lenient, as written in the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 77. The <em>Bei'ur Halachah</em> cites the            <em>Eliyah Rabbah</em> based on the <em>Levush</em>, that in practice it is correct to be stringent. The <em>Beit Yosef</em> writes that the
            stringent opinion should be taken under consideration with regard to prayer in a congregation (where there are permanent seats) and he therefore
            does not mention the lenient opinion in the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>. This is also what the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 143 writes.
        </p>
        <p>
If his rabbi is behind him, the <em>Beit Yosef</em>,<em> Orach Chaim</em> 90:24, writes that one must be stringent even farther away than four<em>amot</em>, since even then this can be expressed as arrogance (<em>yohara</em>) towards his rabbi. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> in<em> Orach Chaim</em> does not mention this, but in <em>Yoreh De'ah</em> 242:16, states explicitly that even when his rabbi is behind him, four            <em>amot</em> are sufficient. That seems to be the opinion of the <em>Rama</em> as well who refers to <em>Yoreh De'ah</em>. Therefore, in practice,
            the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> retracted what he wrote in the <em>Beit Yosef</em>. However, the <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 144 writes that one should be
            stringent when he can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the ruling regarding one's father is like the law concerning one's primary rabbi, as brought by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 73, in
            the name of the <em>Chayei Adam</em>. However, fathers are usually happy that their children pray next to them. Therefore, anyone who knows that
            his father wants him to sit next to him is permitted to sit there and fulfills a mitzvah by doing so, for when a father relinquishes his honor, his
            honor is relinquished. But one may not pray behind his father or in front of him, unless his father explicitly tells him he may pray there.

            When the odor spreads to another domain, or when the excrement is covered (for example, feces in a diaper), it is forbidden to recite matters of
            sanctity in any place that it can be smelled. The <em>poskim</em> disagree as to whether or not one must move four <em>amot</em> away from the
            place that the smell dissipated. The <em>Rashba</em> says that it is not necessary to move four <em>amot</em> away because it is considered a foul
            odor that does not have substance, but according to the <em>Roke'ach</em>, it is a bad smell that does have substance. The <em>Acharonim</em> also
differ on this matter. (The <em>Yalkut Yosef</em>, part 1, p. 130, note 16 writes that one may be lenient, for that is the opinion of most<em>Acharonim.</em>) Additionally, see the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>'s introduction to section 79, the seventh law, as well as            <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 79:17, 76:3, and <em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 79:1, where it is implied that <em>l'chatchilah</em> one should be stringent.
