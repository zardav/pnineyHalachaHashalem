Chapter Sixteen: Seder Night
</h1>
<a name="1"></a><h2>
1. Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Before detailing the laws of the Seder, let us briefly survey the <em>mitzvot</em> we fulfill on the Seder night.
</p>
<p>
    Two elements constitute the foci of the Seder: The first is commemoration of our Exodus from Egypt and emancipation from slavery and reflection on the
    significance of Israel's freedom. The second is to transmit our tradition to the next generation. Both of these are included in the Torah's commandment to
    tell the story of the Exodus on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan.
</p>
<p>
    In order to make this commemoration tangible, the Torah commands us to eat the <em>korban Pesah </em>(Paschal sacrifice), matza, and <em>maror</em> on this
    night. The Paschal sacrifice recalls God's miraculous slaying of the Egyptian firstborn while "passing over" the houses of the Israelites, sparing their
    firstborns. The matza recalls the <em>matzot</em> our forefathers ate when they left Egypt for freedom. And the <em>maror</em> recalls the hard labor and
    bitter enslavement our forefathers experienced at the hands of the Egyptians.
</p>
<p>
    Because the Temple is now in ruins, we are unable to offer the Paschal sacrifice; we eat the <em>afikoman </em>in its stead. On the Torah level, the mitzva
    to eat <em>maror</em> is contingent on eating the Paschal sacrifice; when the Pesah sacrifice is not offered, there is no mitzva to eat <em>maror</em>.
    However, the Sages instituted eating <em>maror</em> even after the destruction of the Temple.
</p>
<p>
    No change has taken place regarding the mitzva to eat matza. Thus, even after the destruction of the Temple there is a Torah commandment to eat an olive's
    bulk (<em>kezayit</em>) of matza.
</p>
<p>
    The Sages also instituted the integration of four cups of wine into the recitation of the Hagada, which we drink as an expression of joy and freedom.
</p>
<p>
    They also instituted that we eat <em>matzot</em> and drink wine while reclining, as a demonstration of freedom.
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>
2. Preparing for the Seder
</h2>
<p>
    As noted, one of the two key objectives of the Seder is to transmit the tradition of the Exodus to our children. In order to keep younger children alert,
    we do many unusual things at the Seder: we dip vegetables in liquid twice, wash our hands twice, and give the appearance of beginning the meal before
    suddenly starting to recite the Hagada. In addition, the <em>mitzvot</em> of eating matza, drinking four cups of wine, and reclining also prompt the
    children to ask: "Why is this night different from all other nights?"<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    The Sages also instruct one to give nuts and candy to small children at the beginning of the Seder, so they see yet another change and ask: "Why is this
    night different?" (SA 472:16). It is good to give them small candies throughout the Seder, keeping them alert and happy.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    An effort is made to buy new clothes for the children and the entire household before Pesah, in order to make everybody happy. Indeed, the mitzva to be
    joyful applies to each of the three pilgrimage festivals (Pesah, Shavu'ot, and Sukkot), and it is therefore a mitzva to buy clothes and jewelry for the
    women and girls, give young children candy and nuts, and serve meat and wine to men at each festival (SA 528:2-3). However, we are even more careful about
    buying new clothes for Pesah, because wearing them for the Seder evokes a special sense of excitement for this exalted night.
</p>
<p>
It is proper to set the table and arrange the Seder plate before evening, so that <em>kiddush</em> can be recited as soon as possible after the    <em>Ma'ariv </em>prayer. In this way, there is no wasting of the precious time when the children are still alert and can still participate in reciting the
    Hagada, eating the matza, and drinking the wine. However, <em>kiddush </em>should not be recited before <em>tzeit ha-kokhavim </em>(the appearance of three
distinct stars), because <em>kiddush </em>must be recited at a time when matza can be eaten, i.e., the night of the fifteenth of Nisan. Moreover, the    <em>kiddush</em> wine is the first of the four cups, and one must drink all four cups at night (<em>ibid</em>. 472:1; MB <em>ad loc. </em>4).
</p>
<p>
    When setting the table, one should put out comfortable chairs so that participants will be able to recline. Ideally, the table should be set with the
    finest silverware and dishes. During the course of the year, we refrain from setting the table with overly attractive utensils, in remembrance of the
    Temple's destruction, but on Shabbat and holidays we do everything we can to enhance the table's beauty (SA 560:2; MB <em>ad loc.</em> 5). On the Seder
    night, it is a mitzva to beautify the table with the absolute best utensils, as it expresses freedom and joy (SA 472:2; MB <em>ad loc. </em>6).
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h2>
3. The Seder Plate
</h2>
<p>
    Before the Seder, one must prepare the Seder plate, on which all of the special Seder foods are arranged. Setting the Seder plate is not merely to keep the
    foods close by and at the ready, but also because each food commemorates and emphasizes a particular idea, and we must keep all the foods in front of us to
    express the uniqueness of the Seder. These foods are placed on the Seder plate:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Three <em>matzot</em></strong>
with which we fulfill the Torah's commandment to eat matza. We place them on the Seder plate so we can recite the Hagada in the presence of matza and    <em>maror</em>, fulfilling the verse: "Tell your child on that day: 'It is because of <strong>this</strong> that God did for me when I left Egypt'" (Shemot
    13:8), which the Sages interpret: "'because of this' means when matza and <em>maror</em> are before you" (<em>Mekhilta</em> <em>Bo</em> 17). Additionally,
    matza is called "<em>lehem</em> <em>oni</em>" - "poor man's bread" (Devarim 16:3), which the Sages interpret to mean "bread over which we '<em>onim</em>' -
    answer or say - many things." The matza must therefore be uncovered while we recite the Hagada. However, out of respect for the matza, which is the most
    important food on the table and over which we recite the "<em>ha-motzi</em>" blessing, we do not recite <em>kiddush</em> while the matza is uncovered.
    Therefore, we cover the <em>matzot </em>during <em>kiddush </em>and when we lift our wine glasses, but otherwise they remain exposed while we recite the
Hagada. Some have a custom to separate the three <em>matzot</em> with cloth (based on the writings of Arizal), and others have a custom not to separate the    <em>matzot</em> (<em>Hayei</em> <em>Adam</em>).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Maror</em></strong>
    is lettuce or horseradish. When the Temple stood, there was a Torah commandment to eat <em>maror</em> with the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em>, but since
    the destruction of the Temple, the mitzva to eat <em>maror</em> is rabbinic.
</p>
<p>
    In Temple times, the meat of the <em>korban Pesah </em>was also put on the Seder table, but with the Temple's destruction, the Sages enacted that two
    cooked foods be placed on the table: one to commemorate Paschal sacrifice, and the other to commemorate the <em>korban</em> <em>hagiga </em>(pilgrimage
sacrifice), offered on every pilgrimage festival (<em>Pesahim</em> 114a-b). Customarily, the Paschal sacrifice is commemorated with a<strong><em>zero'a</em></strong>, alluding to the fact that God redeemed us with an "outstretched arm" ("<em>zero'a netuya</em>"). We roast the    <em>zero'a</em>, just as the Paschal sacrifice was roasted. Sephardic Jews customarily use the foreleg of a lamb or goat, whereas Ashkenazim use the wing
    of a fowl. The <em>korban</em> <em>hagiga </em>is customarily commemorated with a roasted or boiled <strong>egg</strong>. Eggs are customarily served to
    mourners, as their round shape consolingly reminds them of life's cyclical nature. At the Seder, the egg similarly reminds us that the Temple will be
    speedily rebuilt and we will again be able to offer the Paschal and <em>hagiga </em>sacrifices. Additionally, the Aramaic word for egg, "<em>bei'a,</em>"
can also refer to prayerful petition - alluding to our petitioning God to redeem us once again (SA 473:4). The custom in most communities is not to eat the    <em>zero'a</em> on the Seder night (see below section 32).
</p>
<p>
    We also place <strong><em>karpas</em></strong> and either vinegar or salt water on the Seder plate. <em>Karpas </em>is the vegetable that we eat before
    reciting the Hagada. It is dipped in vinegar or salt water both to make it tastier and to create the need for an additional hand-washing, which causes the
    children to ask more questions.
</p>
<p>
    We place <strong><em>haroset</em></strong> on the Seder plate as well. <em>Haroset</em> alludes to the clay mortar our forefathers made when they were
    enslaved in Egypt. Before eating the <em>maror</em>, we dip it in the <em>haroset</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Wine is not placed on the Seder plate because it is a drink, not a food.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>
4. Arranging the Seder Plate
</h2>
<p>
    The Talmud does not mention the Seder plate, but it does say that "matza, lettuce, <em>haroset,</em> and two cooked foods" are served to the person leading
    the Seder (<em>Pesahim </em>114a). The Rishonim and SA (473:4) state that all of these foods should be placed on a plate. However, this is not obligatory.
    The main thing is that these foods be placed before the Seder leader. It is not necessary to place a Seder plate before each participant or even before
each married participant. Rather, it is enough to place the plate before the Seder leader (MB 473:17). Nevertheless, some have a custom to place    <em>matzot</em> before the head of every household, while the complete Seder plate is placed in front of the Seder leader only.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Since a number of foods must be placed on the plate, the question arises: what is the best way to arrange them? There are several opinions on this matter.
</p>
<p>
    According to Rema, the principle is that the earlier a food appears in the Seder, the closer to the Seder leader it should be placed. This is done in order
    to avoid "passing over the <em>mitzvot.</em>" For example, if the <em>matzot</em> were closer to the leader than the <em>karpas</em>, he would have to pass
    over the <em>matzot</em> when reaching for the <em>karpas</em>, and this would be somewhat disrespectful to the <em>matzot</em>. Therefore, according to
    Rema, one should place the <em>karpas</em> and salt water closest to the leader, because these are eaten at the beginning, even before reciting the Hagada.
    Next come the <em>matzot</em>, which are eaten at the start of the meal. Then come the <em>maror</em> and the <em>haroset</em>, because after eating matza
we eat <em>maror</em> dipped in the <em>haroset</em>. Furthest away on the plate are the <em>zero'a</em> and egg, which commemorate the Paschal and    <em>hagiga </em>offerings.
</p>
<p>
    Some say that there is no need to be particular about arranging the Seder plate in a manner that will prevent "passing over <em>mitzvot</em>," because such
    behavior is only improper when one is presented with the simultaneous opportunity to perform two <em>mitzvot</em>. However, on the Seder night,
    each mitzva has a specific time of its own, and there is no problem in passing over a mitzva whose time for fulfillment has not yet arrived, in order to
    get to a food that must be eaten now.
</p>
<p>
    The Seder plate arrangement based on Arizal's teaching alludes to the ten kabbalistic <em>sefirot</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1001" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 1</button>
    This arrangement is practiced today by most Sephardic, Hasidic, and even some non-Hasidic Ashkenazim. Other Ashkenazim follow Rema, while still others
    follow the Vilna Gaon. Many <em>Hagadot</em> contain diagrams of the Seder plate arrangement, and each of these varying customs has a place in Jewish law.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>
5. <em>Kadesh - Kiddush</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The Seder begins with <em>kiddush</em>, which expresses the sanctity of the Jewish people and of the Pesah holiday. The <em>kiddush</em> of Shabbat and
    other holidays contains the phrase "in commemoration of the Exodus from Egypt," for the source of Israel's sanctity began to reveal itself with the Exodus
    from Egypt, when it was made known that God chose Israel to be His special nation. At the Seder, on the night we left Egypt and are commanded to tell the
    Exodus story, the importance of <em>kiddush </em>is thus compounded. It is therefore fitting to begin the Seder with it.
    <button type="button" id="1002" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 2</button>
</p>
<p>
    Thus, unlike other <em>kiddushim </em>where only one person recites <em>kiddush </em>and drinks the majority of a cup of wine, on the Seder night each
    participant is poured a cup of wine, and after <em>kiddush</em> everyone reclines and drinks most of the wine in his cup. This is the first of the four
    cups of wine.
</p>
<p>
    The rabbinic enactment to recite <em>kiddush</em> over wine expresses an important principle in Judaism. People tend to think that sanctity manifests
    itself in the spiritual realm alone, through prayer and Torah study, assuming that the more one denies the body, the more sanctity he attains. Yet, the
    fact that the Sages instituted <em>kiddush</em> over wine teaches us that sanctity can infuse and find expression even through physical food. This is true
    not only of the staple foods necessary for human sustenance, but even of wine, which brings people joy. Israel's sanctity can be revealed in its totality
    specifically through the fullness of life, which combines the truth of Torah and faith with happiness and joy. We therefore recite <em>kiddush</em> over
    wine.
</p>
<p>
    On every Yom Tov, we recite the <em>berakha </em>of "<em>she-heheyanu</em>," blessing God "Who has given us life, sustained us, and guided us to reach this
season," because Yom Tov is a mitzva that is celebrated anew during a specific season. The Sages inserted <em>she-heheyanu</em> at the end of    <em>kiddush</em>; after declaring the day's sanctity, it is only fitting to bless and thank God for having guided us to this sacred time. If one neglects
    to recite the <em>she-heheyanu</em> after <em>kiddush</em>, he must recite it whenever he remembers, as long as Pesah has not ended.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Many people say a preliminary statement of intention (<em>"hineni</em> <em>mukhan"</em> or <em>"le-shem</em> <em>yihud"</em>) before each of the four cups
of wine. One should not do so between the <em>berakha </em>and drinking, as this constitutes an interruption. Rather, the formula should be recited before    <em>kiddush</em>, and in the case of the other three cups, before the <em>berakha </em>on the wine (MB 473:1).
</p>
<p>
If the first day of Pesah coincides with Shabbat, we invoke Shabbat in the <em>kiddush</em>. If it begins on Saturday night, two<em>berakhot </em>are added: on the creation of fire ("<em>borei me'orei ha-esh</em>") and on the separation of different forms of sanctity ("    <em>Ha-mavdil bein kodesh le-kodesh</em>") (SA 473:2).
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>
6. The Four Cups
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages instituted drinking four cups of wine on the Seder night in order to increase the joy of redemption and give expression to our freedom. On every
    Yom Tov there is a mitzva to rejoice by drinking wine, but for Pesah the Sages further integrated four cups of wine into the Seder, so that our joy finds
    expression in each of its phases. <em>Kiddush</em> is recited over the first cup, and thus everyone's cup is filled prior to <em>kiddush</em>. The story of
the Exodus and the first part of <em>Hallel </em>are recited over the second cup, which is therefore filled just before the telling of the story is begun.    <em>Birkat Ha-mazon </em>is recited over the third cup; we refill our glasses prior to its recitation and drink the wine right after. Finally, we pour the
    fourth cup, recite the second part of <em>Hallel</em> and "the Great <em>Hallel</em>" (see below section 35) over it, and then drink the cup. Thus, every
    recitation at the Seder is over wine.
</p>
<p>
    If one drinks four cups of wine one after another, it is as if he drank only one cup (SA 472:8). Even if one waited between cups, if he did not recite any
    of the Hagada during these pauses, he has not fulfilled this obligation according to several <em>poskim </em>(Rashbam, Ran, <em>Pri Hadash</em>). This is
because one must drink while discussing the Exodus. According to <em>Beit Yosef</em>, however, if one pauses between cups he fulfills his obligation    <em>be-di'avad </em>(BHL <em>ad loc</em>. s.v. "she-lo").
</p>
<p>
    The Sages explain the four cups as alluding to several things: the four expressions of redemption used in the Torah's account of the Exodus; the four
    kingdoms that subjugated Israel after it became a nation (Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome), and from which the Almighty saved us; the four cups of
    calamity that God will serve to the wicked among the nations of the world; and the corresponding four cups of consolation that God will pour out to Israel
    (<em>y. Pesahim</em> 10:1).
</p>
<p>
    As a rule, the number four represents completeness, for everything in the world has four sides, corresponding to the four points of the compass. Since the
    Exodus brought about a complete upheaval in the world, the Torah uses four expressions of redemption in relation to it:
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, say to the Israelites: "I am the Lord. <strong>I will rescue you</strong> from beneath the burden of Egypt; <strong>I will save you</strong>
    from their enslavement; <strong>I will redeem you</strong> with an outstretched arm and great acts of judgment; and <strong>I will take you </strong>for
    Myself as a people and be your God. Thus you will know that I am the Lord your God, Who is taking you out from beneath the burden of Egypt." (Shemot 6:6-7)
</p>
<p>
    Israel's bondage in Egypt was more than just the enslavement of those 600,000 Jews. It manifested the subjugation of the spirit to the material, because
    the possibility of expressing spirituality in the world depends on the people of Israel, who were enslaved by the most materialistic of kingdoms, Egypt. In
    order to free Israel so that they could receive the Torah and illuminate and rectify the world, it was necessary to break all barriers of oppression, from
    each direction. The four expressions of redemption correspond to these.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, a fifth expression of redemption appears in the very next verse: "<strong>I will bring you</strong> to the land that I swore to give to Avraham,
    Yitzhak, and Yaakov. I will give it to you as an inheritance; I am the Lord" (<em>ibid.</em> 8). Since this verse does not address the Exodus itself, the
    Sages did not institute a corresponding fifth cup. Nonetheless, it is customary to pour a fifth cup, known as Eliyahu's Cup ("<em>Kos shel Eliyahu</em>"),
    which alludes to the complete redemption that begins with entry into the Promised Land (see section 35 below).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>
7. The Wine
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages stated (<em>Pesahim </em>108b) that in order to fulfill the mitzva of the four cups properly, one must dilute the wine with water, because
    otherwise it will be too strong and cause intoxication. Though the alcohol in such wine gives one pleasure, the mitzva is to drink the wine in the manner
    of free people, that is, like wealthy people who have control of their own time and permit themselves to drink the best wine, making sure it is diluted
    properly so that one can enjoy it without getting drunk. Today's wine is not as strong, and there is no need to dilute it. Even when it <em>is</em>
    necessary to dilute it, this is done at the winery. Therefore, there is no mitzva today to dilute the wine (MB 472:29).
</p>
<p>
    Instead, nowadays we enhance the expression of our freedom by purchasing the finest wine that is strong enough to intoxicate, because such wine causes a
    sense of joy, liberation, and freedom. However, one must be careful not to use a wine so strong that it disrupts one's ability to concentrate on the Hagada
    and to fulfill the <em>mitzvot</em> of the Seder night. One must therefore drink four cups of wine in a manner that brings joy and does not cause
    drowsiness or intoxication. If one fears that by drinking a full cup of regular wine he will be unable to concentrate properly while reading the Hagada, he
    should mix his wine with grape juice. This will allow him to drink wine that intoxicates, while properly fulfilling all the <em>mitzvot</em> of the Seder
night. One who finds it difficult to drink wine that contains even just a small amount of alcohol may fulfill the mitzva by drinking grape juice (    <em>Mikra'ei</em> <em>Kodesh </em>2:35).
</p>
<p>
    When the Sages instituted the four cups, they did not imagine that one would fulfill this mitzva with grape juice, as in their day there was no way to
    preserve the juice without it turning into vinegar. They wanted us to recite the Hagada and tell the Exodus story while drinking wine that enhances
    enjoyment. One who uses grape juice does not fulfill the mitzva in the way the Sages intended it. Even one who does not enjoy the taste of wine or who gets
    headaches from it must drink the four cups. In fact, the Gemara recounts that R. Yehuda b. Ilai had to wrap his head in a kerchief from Pesah until
    Shavu'ot due to a headache caused by drinking four cups of wine (<em>Nedarim </em>49b; SA 472:10; MB <em>ad loc</em>. 35). However, if wine will cause one
    to be ill and lie down he is exempt from this mitzva. Now that grape juice is available, even one who merely suffers from the effects of wine - for
    example, it gives him headaches - may discharge his obligation using grape juice.
</p>
<p>
Women are also commanded to drink four cups of wine, just as they are commanded to fulfill all of the <em>mitzvot</em> of the Seder night (SA 472:14).    <em>Le-khathila,</em> they too should drink wine that maximizes enjoyment. However, if a woman fears becoming intoxicated, she may use grape juice to
    dilute or even completely replace the wine if she prefers.
    <button type="button" id="1003" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 3</button>
</p>
<p>
    The Sages also stated that there is a mitzva to seek out fine red wine (<em>y. Pesahim</em> 10:1). However, <em>be-di'avad,</em> any wine is adequate, even
    cheap white wine (SA 472:11).<u></u>
</p>
<a name="8"></a><h2>
8. The Amount of Wine and Cup Size
</h2>
<p>
In order to fulfill the mitzva of the four cups, or any other mitzva that involves drinking wine (such as <em>kiddush</em>, <em>havdala</em>,    <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em>, and wedding ceremonies), there must be a significant amount of wine in the cup. The Sages determined that the cup must
    contain at least a quarter of a <em>log </em>(a "<em>revi'it</em>") of wine. Less than this is not a significant amount of wine and does not suffice to
    fulfill the obligation (<em>Pesahim</em> 108b).
</p>
<p>
    A <em>revi'it</em> is equal in volume to an egg and a half. R. Hayim Naeh calculated, based on writings of Rambam and other Rishonim, that this is 86
    milliliters. However, more precise measurements showed that it is c. 75 ml (see <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>10:11). This amount, however,
is not agreed upon by everyone. The exile gave rise to uncertainties regarding the size of olives and eggs, and some later Ashkenazic <em>poskim</em> (    <em>Noda</em> <em>Bi-Yehuda</em>, <em>Hazon</em> <em>Ish</em>) rule that today's eggs are only about half the size of eggs in the time of the Sages.
Therefore, a <em>revi'it </em>is closer to the volume of three of today's eggs, c. 150 ml. This stringent measure is known today as a "Hazon Ish    <em>shi'ur.</em>"
</p>
<p>
    In practice, the lenient opinion is the standard, and this is the practice of Sephardim. However, MB 271:68 and 486:1 states regarding the practice of
Ashkenazim that it is best to take the stringent opinion into account with regard to <em>mitzvot </em>of Torah origin like <em>kiddush </em>and    <em>havdala</em>. However, when it comes to rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em> like the four cups at the Seder or the minimum amount that must be drunk in order to
    recite a <em>berakha aharona </em>(a blessing recited after eating or drinking), we use the smaller measure, in keeping with the majority opinion. Those
    who wish to be stringent, and who enjoy drinking wine, are commendable.
</p>
<p>
    One must also take care to meet the Sages' requirements for a <em>kos</em> <em>shel</em> <em>berakha</em> (a cup of wine linked to the performance of a
    mitzva). A broken cup must not be used, and the cup, however large, must be filled with wine in honor of the mitzva.
</p>
<p>
    The cup must be clean, thoroughly rinsed inside and out, before the first cup. However, as long as it has not become dirtied, it is unnecessary to wash it
    again for subsequent cups, since all four cups are considered one continuum (MB 473:68). Nonetheless, some take care to wash the cup before drinking each
    time (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 473:1).
    <button type="button" id="1004" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 4</button>
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h2>
9. How Much Wine?
</h2>
<p>
Optimally, one should drink all of the wine in the cup, which means at least a <em>revi'it</em>. If one uses a large cup that contains more than a    <em>revi'it</em>, he should, <em>le-khathila</em>, drink all of the wine in the cup. If he does not want to, he should at least try to drink most of it. At
    the very least, one must drink most of a <em>revi'it</em> and a "<em>melo</em> <em>lugmav</em>." In other words, there are two conditions: first, he must
    drink most of the wine that is required to be in the cup, i.e., most of a <em>revi'it </em>(38 ml or 76 ml in Hazon Ish <em>shi'ur</em>). Secondly, this
    amount must fill <em>melo</em> <em>lugmav</em> - enough wine to fill the drinker's mouth with one cheek inflated. This is the amount of wine that settles
one's mind. For someone with a normal size mouth, <em>melo</em> <em>lugmav</em> a bit more than most of a <em>revi'it</em>. For one with a large mouth,    <em>melo lugmav </em>is closer to a <em>revi'it</em>. A thirteen-year-old, whose mouth is small and whose <em>melo</em> <em>lugmav</em> is less
than half a <em>revi'it</em> must drink most of a <em>revi'it</em> in order to fulfill the first condition (SA 472:9; MB <em>ad loc. </em>30; BHL    <em>ad loc. </em>s.v. "ve-yishteh").
    <button type="button" id="1005" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 5</button>
</p>
<p>
    Children who have reached the age of mitzva education are given four cups of wine (SA 472:15). The age of education is when the child understands the
    meaning of the things that are said while the cups are filled - <em>kiddush</em>, the Hagada, <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>, and <em>Hallel</em> (SAH
    472:25) - generally around age five or six. There is no need for them to drink most of a <em>revi'it</em>; <em>melo lugmav</em> suffices (MB 472:47).
</p>
<p>
    One must drink most of the wine in the cup "at once." It is obvious that if one drinks half of the necessary amount, and then, after a long pause, drinks
    the second half, he did not drink the necessary amount "at once" and thus did not fulfill drinking one of the four cups. However, leading Rishonim and
    Aharonim are divided over precisely how quickly one must drink the requisite amount of wine in order for it to be considered "at once." According to
    Rambam, since people are accustomed to drink continuously, albeit with short breaks to breathe or swallow, one is only considered to have drunk "at once"
    if he drank continuously, as one would normally drink a <em>revi'it</em>. In other words, the amount of time one takes to drink most of a<em> revi'it</em>
    must be no longer than the amount of time it normally takes to drink an entire <em>revi'it</em>. If it takes one longer to drink most of a<em> revi'it</em>
    than it normally takes people to drink a <em>revi'it</em>, he has not fulfilled the mitzva according to Rambam. Raavad, on the other hand, maintains that
    as long as it does not take longer than the time it takes to eat a half a loaf of bread ("<em>shi'ur akhilat pras</em>"), i.e., within several minutes, it
    is still considered "at once."
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, one should preferably follow the stringent ruling of Rambam and drink most of the cup continuously, taking short breaks to breathe and
    swallow. <em>Be-di'avad</em>, if one drinks most of the wine in the cup within a <em>shi'ur</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>pras</em> (6-7 minutes), he fulfills
    his obligation and need not drink the cup again, since the law of four cups is of rabbinic origin, and the <em>halakha</em> therefore follows the lenient
    position. Nonetheless, some practice stringency.

10. The Mitzva of Reclining
</h2>
<p>
    The Sages ordained that one recline while eating matza and drinking wine at the Seder, because in every generation one must give the appearance of having
just been freed from Egyptian bondage, as it is stated: <em>"</em>He rescued us from there<em>" </em>(Devarim 6:23). This reclining is called "    <em>hasava</em>," and it was instituted so that a sense of liberation would be apparent in one's behavior (MT, Laws of <em>Hametz</em> and Matza 7:6-7).
</p>
<p>
    One who is burdened with a task usually sits upright so that he will be able to rise at once when the time comes for him to carry out his work. Even though
    sitting upright requires some effort on the part of the back muscles and creates a state of constant tension, the need to be ready for action requires this
    state of alertness. However, one who has no burdens can lean back and lie on his side restfully, allowing all of his back muscles to relax. This is how we
    eat on the Seder night, in the manner of the liberated.
</p>
<p>
    In the past, people would sit on pillows and cushions, which meant that sitting erect indeed required effort. In such circumstances, <em>hasava</em> - the
    position between sitting and lying down, where the entire body reclines on a couch or on pillows and cushions - was very comfortable and demonstrated a
    sense of freedom. But today, people sit on chairs and are not accustomed to reclining on couches or eating while reclining to the side. In fact, if one
    were to eat while reclining on a couch these days, it would be more burdensome than comfortable. Therefore, according to Raavya and Raavan, two leading
    Rishonim, there is no mitzva to practice <em>hasava</em> nowadays. However, most Rishonim maintain that since the Sages mandated reclining at the Seder,
    their ordinance stands firm, and there continues to be a mitzva to eat matza and drink the four cups of wine while reclining (Rambam, Rosh, <em>Tur</em>,
    SA 472:2). Today we recline by leaning against the back left of our chairs.
</p>
<p>
The requirement of <em>hasava </em>applies when eating a <em>kezayit</em> of matza, a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>korekh</em>, a <em>kezayit</em> of    <em>afikoman</em>, and while drinking the four cups of wine. It is commendable to recline during the rest of the meal as well, but if one finds this
    uncomfortable, there is no obligation (MT, Laws of <em>Hametz </em>and Matza 7:8). One need not recline while eating the <em>maror</em> (MB 475:14, based
    on <em>Beit</em> <em>Yosef</em>). One should not recline while reciting <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em>, which must be recited with awe and reverence (SA
    183:9). Likewise, it is customary to refrain from <em>hasava</em> while reading the Hagada, so that it is recited with full concentration and seriousness
    (MB 473:81, based on <em>Shlah</em>).
</p>
<a name="11"></a><h2>
11. How to Recline
</h2>
<p>
    Nowadays, people are not used to reclining on couches while eating, and it is therefore necessary to explain how to perform <em>hasava</em> in a chair on
    the Seder night. Instead of sitting erect with one's back against the seat back, one slides his bottom forward to the middle of the seat so that he may
    lean back against the chair back, and tilts to the left. If possible, one should use an upholstered chair with armrests, or try to use a pillow to make
    sitting more comfortable. Regardless, anyone who uses a chair with a backrest fulfills his obligation by reclining against the back of the chair and
    tilting to the left, for this too is an expression of freedom. After all, an office worker, for example, must sit erect in his chair in order to carry out
    his work, but one who has no burdens can stretch out, lean back, and rest in liberated manner.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for reclining to the left is that it is easier to eat this way; with the left hand and back reclining against the chair, the right hand, which
    we generally use, remains free to hold the matza or wine. Additionally, some say that one who reclines to the right runs the risk of choking on his food
and suffocating. Because of this risk, it was ruled that even a left-handed person must recline to the left and use his right hand on the Seder night.    <em>Be-di'avad</em>, a right-handed person who mistakenly reclines to his right does not fulfill his obligation, but a left-handed person who reclines to
    the right does (SA 472:3, MB <em>ad loc. </em>10-11).
</p>
<p>
    If one is sitting in the company of his rabbi or a leading Torah sage, he must ask his permission before reclining, because <em>hasava</em> contains an
    expression of disrespect and irreverence toward the rabbi, and the mitzva to honor the Torah takes precedence over the mitzva of <em>hasava</em>. But if
    one receives permission from his rabbi, then <em>hasava</em> no longer constitutes a display of disrespect (SA 472: 5).
</p>
<a name="12"></a><h2>
12. If One Forgets to Recline
</h2>
<p>
    If one eats a <em>kezayit</em> of matza without reclining, he does not fulfill his obligation, as he has not performed the mitzva as the Sages ordained it,
    and he must eat another <em>kezayit</em> while reclining. Even if one has already recited <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em>, he must wash his hands again,
recite <em>ha-motzi</em>, and eat a second <em>kezayit</em> while reclining. In this case, however, one does not recite the <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em>    <em>matza"</em> blessing a second time, because, according to Raavya and Raavan, he already fulfilled the mitzva of eating matza with the <em>kezayit</em>
    he ate without <em>hasava</em> (SA 472:7, MB <em>ad loc. </em>22).
</p>
<p>
If one forgets to recline for <em>korekh</em>, he need not eat it a second time, since some <em>poskim</em> rule that <em>korekh</em> does not require    <em>hasava</em> because it contains <em>maror</em>. <em>Le-khathila</em>, we customarily recline for <em>korekh</em>, but if one forgets to do so, he may
rely upon those who maintain that <em>hasava</em> is not necessary. If one eats the <em>afikoman</em> without reclining and he can easily eat another    <em>kezayit</em> of <em>afikoman</em> while reclining, he should do so; but if eating another <em>kezayit</em> will be difficult for him, he may rely on
    Raavya and Raavan, who maintain that <em>hasava</em> is not necessary nowadays.
    <button type="button" id="1007" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 7</button>
</p>
<p>
    If one drinks one of the four cups without reclining, the <em>poskim</em> are divided over whether or not he must go back and drink it a second time.
    According to <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>, he must indeed drink the cup again, this time reclining. According to Rema, though, this creates a problem, because by
    drinking again one appears to be adding to the number of cups ordained by the Sages. Therefore, if one drinks the second of the four cups without
    reclining, he must drink it again with <em>hasava</em>, because the second cup precedes the meal, and since it is permissible to drink wine during the
    meal, one who drinks at this point does not appear to be adding to the required four cups. But if one forgot to recline while drinking the first, third, or
    fourth cup, he may not go back and drink it a second time, because by doing so he would appear to be adding to the mitzva. He may rely on Raavya and Raavan
    who maintain that nowadays, when even important people are not accustomed to reclining, one need not perform <em>hasava</em> on the Seder night (SA 472:7,
    MB 21 <em>ad loc.</em>).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>
's ruling that one must drink any of the four cups again with <em>hasava</em>, and Rema's similar ruling about only the second cup, are    <em>le-khathila</em>. If drinking again is difficult, one may rely on what he drank without <em>hasava</em> and need not drink again.

    Women should preferably recline while eating matza and drinking the four cups of wine, but if they forgot, they need not eat or drink again. Important
    women who accidentally eat matza without reclining should eat it again while reclining.

13. May One Drink after the First Cup?
</h2>
<p>
    Technically, one who wishes to drink after the first of the four cups may do so, but one should preferably not drink between the first and second cups so
    that he does not become intoxicated to the point of being unable to read the Hagada with proper concentration. However, it is permissible to drink
    non-alcoholic beverages such as grape juice or any other juice (SA 473:3, MB 16 <em>ad loc.</em>).
</p>
<p>
If, while reciting the blessing over the wine, one had in mind to drink other beverages, he need not recite a <em>berakha </em>over them, because the    <em>berakha </em>over wine covers all beverages. Even if he did not intend to drink other beverages, but they were on the table and there was a chance that
    he might want to drink them, he need not recite a <em>berakha</em> before drinking them, because the blessing over wine covers these too (see SHT 473:18).
    <button type="button" id="1010" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 10</button>
</p>
<p>
    A firstborn who fasted on Erev Pesah, or someone so hungry that he finds it difficult to concentrate on reciting the Hagada, may eat foods such as eggs,
    fruits, potatoes, and <em>kitniyot</em> (for those who eat <em>kitniyot</em> on Pesah) after <em>kiddush</em>. However, he should not eat too much, so that
    he saves his appetite for the matza. Furthermore, this is only permitted when there is great need. If one can restrain himself, it is best not to eat
anything before the meal, because when one eats after <em>kiddush</em>, he runs into the problem of whether he has to recite a <em>berakha</em>    <em>aharona </em>(and if one eats, he must recite a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>).
    <button type="button" id="1011" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 11</button>
</p>
<p>
    This eating and drinking is only permissible before one pours the second cup and begins reciting the Hagada. However, after beginning the Hagada, it is
    forbidden to interrupt by eating or drinking, for reciting the Hagada is like prayer, which cannot be interrupted (BHL 473:3, based on Ramban and Ran;
    however, it notes that <em>Ha-ma'or</em> and <em>Tosafot</em> permit).
</p>
<a name="14"></a><h2>
14. <em>Rahatz</em> - Washing Hands before Eating <em>Karpas</em>
</h2>
<p>
    After <em>kiddush</em> we eat the <em>karpas</em>, a vegetable. The Sages ordained eating <em>karpas</em> to create a change that will cause the children
    to ask why it is that tonight, unlike all other nights, we are eating a vegetable before the meal (Rashi and Rashbam on <em>Pesahim</em> 114a). Another
    reason given for this is that free people generally begin their meals with a vegetable appetizer, and so we do the same at the beginning of the Seder
    (Maharil).
</p>
<p>
    The Sages ordained dipping the vegetable in a liquid, because this necessitates washing the hands before eating it, which is also a departure from the
    usual order of things. Ordinarily, the hands are washed only once at the beginning of the meal before eating bread. Thereafter, a variety of other foods
    are eaten. However, even if we dip these other foods in liquids, it is not necessary to wash our hands a second time, because hand-washing for bread covers
    the whole meal. At the Seder, though, we wash once before eating the <em>karpas</em> and a second time after reciting the Hagada, before eating the matza.
The children therefore ask: "Why is this night different that, unlike all other nights, on this night we wash our hands twice?" (<em>Tur</em> and    <em>Beit</em> <em>Yosef</em> 473:6). In addition, dipping the vegetable in liquid gives expression to our freedom, because this is the best way to eat it:
    not only does it serve as an appetizer, we even pamper ourselves by dipping it in salt water or vinegar, which enhances flavor and stimulates the appetite.
</p>
<p>
    A full explanation of this law lies beyond the scope of this book, but suffice it to say that liquids conduct impurity ("<em>tum'a</em>") more effectively
    than solid foods. The Sages therefore ordained the washing of hands before eating a food that has been dipped in liquid. According to most Rishonim, this
    hand washing has the same status as hand washing before eating bread: both were instituted to avoid <em>tum'a</em>. Even though nowadays we do not
observe the laws of ritual purity and impurity, the institution remains in force. Thus, just as one must recite the <em>berakha </em>of "<em>al</em>    <em>netilat</em> <em>yadayim"</em> over the hand washing before bread, so must one recite this blessing before eating a food dipped in liquid. This is the
    opinion of Rambam and Rosh. However, according to R. Meir of Rothenburg (Maharam), <em>Itur</em>, and <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Pesahim</em> 115a), there is a
    difference between these two types of hand washing: <em>netilat</em> <em>yadayim</em> before bread was instituted for purposes of sanctity and cleanliness,
and thus even today hands should be washed for cleanliness before a meal. Consequently, this hand washing requires a <em>berakha</em>. However,    <em>netilat</em> <em>yadayim</em> before eating a food dipped in liquid is only due to <em>tum'a</em>, and since these laws are not practiced nowadays,
    there is no need to wash hands before eating a food dipped in liquid.
    <button type="button" id="1012" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 12</button>
</p>
<p>
    In practice, we wash our hands before eating <em>karpas</em>, but do not recite a blessing, in order to fulfill all opinions: on the one hand, we wash our
    hands in accordance with the <em>poskim</em> who require it, but on the other hand, we do not recite a <em>berakha</em> because there are those who
    maintain that nowadays there is no need to wash hands before eating food dipped in liquid (SA 473:6).
</p>
<p>
    If one mistakenly recites a blessing over this hand washing, he is not guilty of a <em>berakha</em> <em>le-vatala </em>(a blessing in vain), since he has
    acted in accordance with the majority of <em>poskim</em>, including <em>Levush </em>and Gra, who require a <em>berakha </em>when washing hands for a food
dipped in liquid. However, the <em>le-khathila</em> ruling is not to recite a <em>berakha</em>, because we rule leniently in cases of uncertainty about    <em>berakhot</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1013" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 13</button>
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, if one mistakenly recites a <em>berakha</em> over the first hand washing, this does not exempt him from the second hand washing, and he must
    recite a blessing over it as well. This is because people are not meticulous about keeping their hands clean between the two washings. In addition, the
    time spent reciting the Hagada constitutes an interruption between the two hand washings, and therefore the Sages ordained washing hands twice at the Seder
    (see <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 473:107; BHL 475:1; <em>Mikra'ei</em> <em>Kodesh</em> ch. 7 n. 8).
</p>
<a name="15"></a><h2>
15. <em>Karpas</em>
</h2>
<p>
    As noted, the Sages ordained eating a vegetable dipped in liquid between <em>kiddush</em> and the recitation of the Hagada in order to change routine; all
    year long, we eat vegetables during the meal, after washing hands over bread, but at the Seder we eat a bit of vegetable before reciting the Hagada and
    before washing hands for the meal. Two things are unusual about this: first, we eat a vegetable before the meal, and second, we wash our hands twice
    instead of once (Rashi and Rashbam on <em>Pesahim</em> 114a; <em>Tur</em> �473). In addition, because we eat a vegetable before reciting the Hagada, our
    Seder meal is imbued with added importance, because the finest banquets generally begin with appetizers and hors d'oeuvres, followed by a pause for a
    different part of the program, after which the main meal begins (based on <em>Bah</em>).
</p>
<p>
The word "<em>karpas</em>" appears neither in the Mishna nor in the Talmud; we are only told that a vegetable is eaten before the Hagada is recited (    <em>Pesahim</em> 114-115). But a few Rishonim (Maharil, Raavan) write that <em>karpas</em> should be used, because its Hebrew name alludes to the 600,000
men put to hard labor in Egypt (the Hebrew letters of the word <em>karpas </em>can be rearranged to spell "<em>samekh parekh</em>"; the letter    <em>samekh</em> has a numerical value of sixty or 600,000, and <em>parekh</em> means hard labor). Though not mandatory, the Aharonim say that it is good to
use <em>karpas</em> (SA 473:6, MB 19 and <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 49 <em>ad loc</em>.). However, there are differing opinions about what    <em>karpas</em> is. Some say it is celery, and this is the widespread custom among Sephardim. Others say it is parsley, which is the custom of some
    Ashkenazim. Most Ashkenazim, however, use neither celery nor parsley, because there is uncertainty about what blessing to recite over them in the
    Ashkenazic custom. They instead use boiled potatoes. Each family should continue its own tradition.
    <button type="button" id="1014" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 14</button>
</p>
<p>
    We dip the <em>karpas</em> in salt water or vinegar and recite the <em>berakha </em>of <em>"borei</em> <em>pri</em> <em>ha-adama"</em> (Who creates the
    food of the soil) with the intention that it also apply to the <em>maror</em> that will be eaten later in the meal. It is not necessary to recline while
    eating <em>karpas</em> because some <em>poskim</em> say it alludes to the suffering of enslavement in Egypt, and therefore need not be eaten as a
    demonstration of freedom.
</p>
<p>
    One must eat less than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em>. Though some Rishonim (Rambam) say that more than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em> should
    be eaten, it is best to avoid this. Eating more than a <em>kezayit</em> invites uncertainty about making a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>, since
    according to Ri, a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em> is necessary, but according to Rashbam, one should not recite a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>,
because the blessing over the <em>karpas</em> covers the <em>maror</em> we eat during the meal. Therefore, as said, it is best not to eat a    <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em>. If one eats more than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em>, he should not recite a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>,
    because we rule leniently whenever there is uncertainty about reciting a <em>berakha</em> (Maharil; SA 473:6).

</p>
<a name="16"></a><h2>
16. <em>Yahatz</em> - Breaking the Middle Matza
</h2>
<p>
    Three <em>matzot</em> are arranged on the Seder plate. After eating <em>karpas</em>, before reciting the Hagada, the Seder leader (and whoever else has
    three <em>matzot</em> in front of him), breaks the middle matza in half. One piece is saved for the <em>afikoman</em>, and the other is left between the
    two whole <em>matzot</em> (SA 463:6).
</p>
<p>
    The reason for this is that the matza alludes to our poverty and enslavement in Egypt, and is hence called "<em>lehem</em> <em>oni</em>" - "poor man's
    bread" (Devarim 16:3). Paupers often eat partial loaves of bread because they are unable to buy whole loaves. So, in order to give expression to the
    poverty, we break the matza in half. We do this before beginning the Hagada since the Hagada should be recited in the presence of the matza. This is
    because the term "<em>lehem</em> <em>oni</em>" also means "bread over which we '<em>onim</em>' - answer or say - many things," and this means that the
Hagada must be recited while the matza, in the form it will be eaten, is before us. This is why it must be broken in half before we begin the Hagada    <em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, on the Seder night<em>,</em> just like on every Shabbat and Yom Tov, there is a mitzva to recite <em>ha-motzi</em> over two whole loaves of
bread/matza ("<em>lehem mishneh</em>"). Therefore, we set the table with three <em>matzot</em>: the middle one is broken in half to give expression to    <em>lehem oni</em>, while the top and bottom <em>matzot</em> remain whole and serve as <em>lehem mishneh</em>. (Later, when reciting "<em>ha-motzi,</em>"
one should hold all three <em>matzot</em> so that there is <em>lehem mishneh</em>, and before reciting the <em>berakha </em>of <em>"al</em>    <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza,"</em> we put down the bottom matza and recite the blessing over the top and middle <em>matzot</em>, in order to highlight the
    broken matza to a greater degree.)
    <button type="button" id="1016" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 16</button>
</p>
<p>
    The larger piece of the broken matza is designated as the <em>afikoman</em>, and the custom is to wrap it in a napkin, in recollection of the verse, "The
    people took their dough before it was leavened; their kneading leftover dough was wrapped in their robes" (Shemot 12:34). Some people have a custom to
    place the <em>afikoman</em> on their shoulder for a moment, in remembrance of the Exodus, when people carried <em>matzot</em> on their shoulders (MB
    473:59).
</p>
<p>
    Afterward, we hide the <em>afikoman</em> and save it until the end of the Seder, when it is eaten in commemoration of the Paschal sacrifice (see sections
    33 and 34 below).
</p>
<p>
    In many homes, the children customarily "steal" the <em>afikoman</em> and keep it until the end of the meal, when they give it back in return for a gift.
    This helps them stay awake for the entire Seder. In my family, we give gifts to all children who remain awake until after the <em>afikoman</em> is eaten.
</p>
<a name="17"></a><h2>17. <em>Magid</em> - Beginning the Hagada
</h2>
<p>
    After breaking the middle matza, we uncover the <em>matzot</em>, and the Seder leader lifts the entire Seder plate, or at least the <em>matzot</em>, for
    all of the participants to see. While doing so, he recites the paragraph <em>"Ha</em> <em>Lahma</em> <em>Anya"</em> and explains the meaning of the words
    to the participants. Upon completing <em>Ha</em> <em>Lahma</em> <em>Anya</em>, the Seder leader places the Seder plate or <em>matzot</em> back on the table
    (SA 473:6).
</p>
<p>
At this point, the Seder plate is removed, making it appear as if the Seder is over. This is done so that the children become surprised and ask why the    <em>matzot</em> and Seder plate are being taken away before we have even begun eating. Consequently, they ask <em>"Ma</em> <em>nishtana</em>?<em>"</em> (SA
    473:6).
</p>
<p>
    After removing the Seder plate, and even before reciting <em>"Ma</em> <em>nishtana</em>,<em>"</em> we pour the second cup. This also surprises the
    children, because we do not usually pour two cups of wine before a meal. Another reason we do this is that we want the whole Hagada, including the
    questions that precede it, to be said over a cup of wine.
</p>
<p>
    It is best not to pour wine into the cups of the young children at this point, because they will have a hard time making it through the long Hagada without
    spilling the cup, and wine spilled on the table can cause aggravation and demonstrates disrespect for Yom Tov, which should be honored with a clean
    tablecloth and a beautifully set table. Therefore, it is best to pour wine for the children near the end of the Hagada, shortly before drinking the second
    cup.
</p>
<p>
    After the second cup has been poured, the children ask <em>"Ma</em> <em>nishtana</em>?<em>"</em> Following this, the Seder plate is returned so that the
    Hagada can be recited in the presence of matza and <em>maror</em>, and we begin answering the children with the story of the Exodus. We have already seen
    (ch. 15) that the purpose of the Seder night is to fulfill the mitzva of narrating the Exodus, and that the essence of this mitzva is to tell this story to
    the children. We also saw that there is a Torah commandment to tell the story of the Exodus even when no children are present (above 15:1) and that there
    is a mitzva to begin the story with a question (<em>ibid</em>. 3-4). We also learned that the story must be tailored to the ability and understanding of
    each child (<em>ibid</em>. 5), and that when telling the story, one must begin with indignity and end with praise (<em>ibid</em>. 7). We also saw that the
    purpose of the Seder is that the children learn, by means of the Exodus story, about the mission of the Jewish people in this world: to adhere to God,
    uphold His <em>mitzvot</em>, live in the land that He swore to give to our ancestors and to us, to enumerate His praises among the nations, and to earn
    divine blessing and goodness (<em>ibid</em>. 6).
</p>
<p>
    The Sages introduced a fixed text for the Hagada so people would relate the story of the Exodus with precision and without omitting any important elements.
    Additionally, it is commendable to continue telling the story after the Seder ends. However, during the recitation of the Hagada one must take care not to
    make things too tiresome and long-winded for the children and other participants. Reciting the text is sufficient to fulfill the mitzva in the optimal
    manner.
</p>
<a name="18"></a><h2>18. Laws of Reciting the Hagada
</h2>
<p>
    One who merely contemplates the Hagada does not fulfill the obligation to tell the Exodus story, as it is stated, <em>"</em>Tell your child<em>" </em>
    (Shemot 13:8), i.e., express the story verbally. However, it is not necessary for all participants to recite the Hagada; the main thing is that the Seder
    leader or someone else recites it aloud, and the others hear it. Indeed, it was customary for the oldest participant to read and explain the Hagada while
    everyone else listened. This is, in fact, the way stories are usually told (see <em>Pesahim</em> 116b).
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays, in order to include everyone in the recitation of the Hagada, it is customary for the Seder leader to read it aloud while everyone else quietly
    reads along with him. Others have participants take turns reading paragraphs from the Hagada, but it is important to note that only a reader who has
    reached halakhic adulthood (i.e., is a bar or bat mitzva) can fulfill this obligation on another's behalf.
</p>
<p>
    When several sets of parents and children have the Seder together, it is not necessary for each father to tell the story to his child separately; it is
    sufficient for the Seder leader or another participant to read the Hagada out loud, because as long as the father makes sure that his child hears the story
    of the Exodus, he has fulfilled the mitzva to <em>"</em>tell your child<em>." </em>One who wishes to enhance the mitzva can further explain the Exodus to
    his child.
</p>
<p>
In order to fulfill the mitzva of telling the Exodus story, one must at the very least explain or hear an explanation of the Paschal sacrifice, matza, and    <em>maror.</em> This makes clear that we were slaves in Egypt and that God redeemed us. Therefore, if parents see that their children are tired and are
    unable to complete the Hagada, they must tell them about the <em>korban Pesah</em>, matza, and <em>maror</em>, and explain their meaning. The same
    principle applies to a participant who is unable to complete the Hagada due to illness or military duty (see above 15:9).
</p>
<a name="19"></a><h2>19. Customs Regarding the Recitation of the Hagada</h2>
<p>
    As stated, the custom is to refrain from reclining while reciting the Hagada, because it must be recited with seriousness and reverence (MB 473:71, based
    on <em>Shlah</em>). However, this seriousness incorporates joy and elation at the fact that God chose us from among all the nations and gave us the Torah
    (see <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 473:152).
</p>
<p>
We have already seen that the matza must be kept uncovered while we recite the Hagada, in keeping with the words of the Sages: "'<em>lehem</em>    <em>oni</em>' - bread over which we '<em>onim</em>' - answer or say - many things" (<em>Pesahim</em> 115b). Giving concrete expression to the Exodus story
    is the foundation of the mitzva to eat matza on the Seder night.
</p>
<p>
However, when we raise the wine glasses to recite the paragraphs of <em>"Ve-hi</em> <em>she</em>-<em>amdah"</em> ("And this [promise] has stood") and "<em>Lefikhakh</em> <em>anahnu</em> <em>hayavim</em>" ("Therefore it is our duty"), as well as when reciting the long <em>berakha </em>on redemption     ("<em>Birkat Ha-ge'ula</em>") just before drinking the second cup, the matza should be covered. The matza is more significant than the wine, and
    therefore, whenever we hold up the cup of wine and show it preference, the matza must be covered (SA 473:7, MB <em>ad loc. </em>73). It is for the same
    reason that we cover the bread when reciting <em>kiddush</em> every Shabbat and Yom Tov.
</p>
<p>
    When reciting the paragraph <em>"Matza</em> <em>zo</em> <em>she</em>-<em>anu</em> <em>okhlim" </em>("This matza that we eat"), the Seder leader holds up
the matza for all of the participants to see, in order to endear the mitzva to them. And when <em>"Maror</em> <em>zeh..."</em> ("This    <em>maror...</em>") is said, the <em>maror</em> is held up. However, when <em>"Pesah</em> <em>zeh..."</em> is said, the <em>zero'a</em> is not held
    up, because it is not the actual meat of the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em>, but merely a commemoration of it. Thus, one who holds it up is like one who
    offers sacrifices outside the Temple precincts (<em>Pesahim</em> 116b; SA 473:7).
</p>
<p>
    It is customary to spill out a bit of wine from the cup when enumerating <em>"dam</em>, <em>va</em>-<em>esh</em>, <em>ve-timrot</em> <em>ashan" </em>
    ("blood, fire, and pillars of smoke" - Yoel 3:3), while reciting <em>"detzah</em>, <em>adash</em>, and <em>be'ahav" </em>(R. Yehuda's mnemonic device for
    remembering the Ten Plagues), and while enumerating the Ten Plagues. This comes to sixteen times. Some have a custom to drip the wine with the index
finger, and others have a custom to pour out a little bit into a broken vessel (Rema 473:7; SHT 81 and<em> Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 163-4<em>ad loc.</em>). Rav Kook rules that one should not spill out <em>Shemitta</em> wine (produced from grapes grown on the Torah's Sabbatical year; some    <em>poskim</em> say that there is a mitzva to drink <em>Shemitta</em> wine, and therefore one should not refrain from using it for the four cups).
</p>
<a name="20"></a><h2>20. The Mitzva to Recite <em>Hallel</em> on the Seder Night</h2>
<p>
    When the Temple stood, people would recite <em>Hallel</em> while offering the <em>korban Pesah</em>, and again while eating it (<em>Pesahim</em> 95a). The
    main reason for reciting <em>Hallel</em> on the first night of Pesah is to sing God's praises; every Jew must see himself, on Pesah night, as though he
    left Egypt personally, and it is only natural to sing praises to God for redeeming us. In fact, this recitation of <em>Hallel </em>is unique: on all other
    holidays we recite <em>Hallel</em> as an expression of praise and thanksgiving to God, but on the night of Pesah we proclaim it as a song (<em>ibid</em>.
    95b).
</p>
<p>
The Sages ordained reciting half of <em>Hallel</em> before the meal and half of it after the meal, so that it encompasses the eating of the <em>korban</em><em>Pesah</em>. Although we no longer have the privilege of eating the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em> nowadays, we eat matza instead (Maharal,<em>Gevurot Hashem</em>, end of ch. 62). In addition, the first half of <em>Hallel</em> contains Psalm 114, "When Israel left Egypt" ("    <em>Be-tzeit Yisrael Mi-Mitzrayim</em>"), which is a continuation of the Hagada's story. This is why, at its conclusion, we recite the blessing
    over the redemption from Egypt ("<em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-ge'ula</em>"). The second half of <em>Hallel</em>, recited after the meal, is a more general song
    of thanks for all redemptions, past and future (<em>Levush</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Another reason for dividing <em>Hallel</em> is that this enables us to drink all four cups over song. We drink the first cup over <em>kiddush</em>, the
second over the first half of <em>Hallel</em>, the third over <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em>, and the fourth over the second half of <em>Hallel</em> (    <em>Manhig</em> �90).
    <button type="button" id="1017" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 17</button>
</p>
<p>
    The Rishonim are divided over whether or not a <em>berakha</em> should be recited over <em>Hallel</em> on Pesah night. Some say two <em>berakhot</em>
    should be recited, one over each half of <em>Hallel</em>. Others say one <em>berakha</em> should be recited. There are differing opinions over the wording
of the <em>berakha</em> as well: some say it should be <em>"likro</em> <em>et</em> <em>ha-Hallel" </em>("to recite <em>Hallel</em>") and others say    <em>"ligmor</em> <em>et</em> <em>ha-Hallel" </em>("to complete the <em>Hallel</em>"). Another group of authorities maintains that no blessing at all should
    be pronounced over <em>Hallel</em> on the Seder night, either because it is divided into two parts (Rosh), because a <em>berakha </em>was already
    pronounced over the <em>Hallel</em> that was recited in the synagogue during the <em>Ma'ariv</em> prayer (Rashba), or because this <em>Hallel</em> is like
    a song and therefore requires no <em>berakha</em> (R. Hai Gaon). Some maintain that <em>Birkat Ha-ge'ula</em> covers <em>Hallel </em>as well. In practice,
    the custom is to refrain from making a <em>berakha</em> over the <em>Hallel</em> we recite at the Seder.
</p>
<p>
    During the rest of the year, we stand while reciting <em>Hallel</em>, because it is like attesting to God's greatness, and testimony must be given while
standing. But the Sages did not wish to burden us on the Seder night, because all of our actions on this night must demonstrate freedom (<em>Beit</em>    <em>Yosef</em> OH 422:7). Nevertheless, as we have learned, the Hagada should not be read while reclining, but with an air of solemnity (<em>Shlah</em>).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hallel </em>
    is customarily read aloud and with sweet singing (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 480:3).
</p>
<a name="21"></a><h2>21. The Laws of the Second and Fourth Cups</h2>
<p>
    The only significant practical difference between communal customs regarding the laws of the Seder pertains to the <em>berakha </em>over the second and
    fourth cups.
</p>
<p>
    Many Rishonim maintain that <em>"borei</em> <em>pri</em> <em>ha-gefen"</em> must be recited over each of the four cups, even though our attention is not
    diverted from one cup to the next, because each cup is a mitzva in its own right. This is the opinion of R. Natronai Gaon, R. Amram Gaon, Rif<em>,</em>
    Rambam, Maharitz (a leading Yemeni authority), and Rema, and it is the practice of Ashkenazim and of Yemeni Jews who follow Rambam.
</p>
<p>
    However, Rosh maintains that <em>"ha-gefen"</em> must only be recited before the first and third cups. The <em>berakha</em> over the first cup covers the
second cup because there is nothing between them to divert our attention. We recite a <em>berakha</em> over the third cup because it follows<em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em> and a <em>berakha</em> is always recited over wine we drink after <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em>, even if    <em>"ha-gefen"</em> was recited earlier in the meal, because <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em> serves as a <em>berakha aharona</em> for the wine one drinks
    during the meal. The <em>berakha</em> over the third cup covers the fourth cup as well. R. Yona and Rashba also maintain that <em>"ha-gefen"</em> is
    recited over the first and third cups only. SA rules accordingly, and this is the Sephardic custom.
</p>
<p>
    There are also differing opinions among Rishonim regarding the <em>berakha aharona</em> over the wine. In practice, however, there is a consensus not to
recite a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona </em>after each cup of wine. Rather, <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em> covers the first two cups, and the    <em>berakha aharona </em>("<em>al ha-gefen</em>") recited after the fourth cup covers both the third and fourth cups.

</p>
<p><strong>The Mitzva to Eat Matza and <em>Maror</em></strong></p>
<a name="22"></a><h2>22. The Mitzva to Eat Matza</h2>
<p>
    There is a Torah commandment to eat matza on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, as it states: "In the evening, you shall eat <em>matzot</em>" (Shemot
12:18). This matza must have been guarded (<em>shmura</em>), as it states: "And you shall observe (<em>u-shemartem</em>) the <em>matzot</em>" (    <em>ibid. </em>17), and some <em>poskim</em> say it must be made by hand, with the specific intention of fulfilling this mitzva (see above 12:4). One who
    eats stolen matza does not fulfill his obligation (SA 454:4). Therefore, it is good to pay for the matza before Pesah, or at least obtain the explicit
    consent of the storeowner to grant the buyer ownership of the matza even if it has not yet been paid for, because if the storeowner does not agree to give
    the matza on credit, one cannot fulfill his obligation with it (MB 454:15).
    <button type="button" id="1019" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 19</button>
    As soon as one eats a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>shmura </em>matza he has fulfilled the Torah commandment, because all eating-related commandments in the
    Torah require the consumption of at least a <em>kezayit</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the Torah obligation, the Sages ordained three more <em>kezeytim </em>of matza to be eaten at the Seder, making a total of four. After
reciting the <em>berakhot </em>of <em>"ha-motzi"</em> and <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat matza</em>,<em>"</em> we eat, <em>le-khathila</em>, two<em>kezeytim</em>: one from the top matza<em>,</em> for <em>"ha-motzi</em>,<em>"</em> and one from the broken middle matza for <em>"al</em>    <em>akhilat matza</em>.<em>"</em> Later, we eat another <em>kezayit</em> with <em>maror</em>, for <em>korekh</em>, and at the end of the meal we eat one
    more <em>kezayit</em> as the <em>afikoman</em> (some say it is preferable to eat two <em>kezeytim </em>for the <em>afikoman</em>).
</p>
<p>
Before getting into the specifics of the size of a <em>kezayit</em>, let us clarify the practical <em>halakha</em>: there is a consensus that a<em>kezayit</em> is about a third of a piece of machine-made matza, and about the same-sized piece of a handmade matza. Thus, right after reciting    <em>"ha-motzi"</em> and <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza</em>,<em>"</em> two-thirds of a machine matza must be eaten. Another third should be eaten
    for <em>korekh</em> and one more for the <em>afikoman </em>(for those who are stringent about eating two <em>kezeytim</em> for the <em>afikoman</em>, one
    half of a matza suffices for this purpose).
</p>
<p>
The <em>kezayit</em> of matza must be eaten continuously. If one pauses while eating, and as a result takes longer than a <em>shi'ur</em> <em>akhilat</em><em>pras</em> to eat a <em>kezayit</em>, he does not fulfill the mitzva. We shall soon discuss exactly how much time a <em>shi'ur</em> <em>akhilat</em>    <em>pras</em> is, but for now, it is enough to say that whoever eats a <em>kezayit</em> of matza continuously fulfills the mitzva without question and need
    not look at the clock, because the only way it is possible to take longer than <em>akhilat</em> <em>pras</em> is if one stops eating for a few minutes.
</p>
<a name="23"></a><h2>23. Calculating the Size of a <em>Kezayit</em> for Torah Commandments</h2>
<p>
    The long exile gave rise to uncertainty regarding the size of a <em>kezayit</em>. According to Rambam, a <em>kezayit</em> is slightly less than a third of
    the volume of an egg; according to <em>Tosafot</em>, it is about the volume of half an egg. In practice, due to this uncertainty, the custom is to follow
    the stricter ruling of <em>Tosafot</em>. The equivalent of half an egg was calculated as being a third of a piece of machine matza and as a similar-sized
    piece of hard handmade matza, whose thickness is similar to that of a machine matza.
</p>
<p>
    This is the consensus of all Sephardic and most Ashkenazic authorities. However, one of the most prominent Ashkenazic Aharonim, R. Yehezkel Landau (also
    known as "Noda Bi-Yehuda"), reached the conclusion, based on his own calculations, that our eggs are half the volume of the eggs that existed at the time
    of the Sages. It follows that a <em>kezayit</em> is not half the size of one of our eggs, but is the size of a whole contemporary egg. R. Avraham Yeshaya
    Karelitz ("Hazon Ish") concurred with Noda Bi-Yehuda's calculations. Thus, in order to fulfill the Torah commandment using the "Hazon Ish <em>shi'ur,</em>"
one must eat an egg's bulk of matza. Although the <em>halakha</em> usually follows the standard <em>shi'ur </em>and does not take Hazon Ish's    <em>shi'ur </em>into consideration, when it comes to the Torah commandment of eating matza, it is proper <em>le-khathila</em> to satisfy all opinions.
    Ideally, then, one should eat a Hazon Ish <em>kezayit </em>of matza, or approximately two-thirds of a matza.
</p>
<p>
    This, however, is not really much of a stringency, since anyway our custom is to eat two <em>kezeytim </em>initially - one for <em>"ha-motzi"</em> and
    another for <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza"</em> (SA 475:1). Since these two <em>kezeytim</em> contain a single Hazon Ish <em>kezayit</em>, we
    fulfill the Torah commandment according to all opinions.
</p>
<p>
    One who finds it difficult to eat two-thirds of a piece of machine matza can eat one third, because according to the standard calculation, a third of a
    matza contains a <em>kezayit</em>. One even recites the <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza"</em> blessing before eating this amount, for the standard
    measure is so well founded that it is not considered the sort of uncertainty that causes the <em>berakha </em>to be canceled.
    <button type="button" id="1020" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 20</button>
</p>
<a name="24"></a><h2>24. The Sephardic Custom Regarding a <em>Kezayit</em></h2>
<p>
    Sephardic Jews customarily do not give any consideration to the Noda Bi-Yehuda/Hazon Ish position, because their own tradition about these measurements was
    handed down in an orderly manner from generation to generation, without change. Even with regard to Torah commandments, they are not concerned about the
Hazon Ish <em>shi'ur. </em>It follows that the volume of a <em>kezayit</em> does not exceed one third of a piece of machine matza (based on the position of    <em>Tosafot</em> that a <em>kezayit</em> is about half an egg).
</p>
<p>
    The above applies when one measures according to volume; however, most Sephardim actually have a custom to base the <em>shi'ur </em>on weight, as it is
    difficult to calculate the volume of each food independently to determine whether one must recite a <em>berakha aharona</em> after eating it. After all,
    foods come in all sorts of shapes and sizes: long and thin, round and square, etc. Some foods contain hollow spaces that are not factored into the volume.
    Thus, in order to make it easier to calculate <em>shi'urim</em>, the practice of measuring by water weight was adopted. It was thus determined
    that a <em>kezayit</em>, or half an egg, is equal to 29 grams (a more recent adjustment puts it at 25 grams). In order to eat this amount of matza, one
    must eat nearly a whole piece of machine matza. In other words, if we calculate a <em>kezayit</em> of matza by weight, it comes out almost three times more
    than if measured by volume.
</p>
<p>
    This means that one must eat four machine <em>matzot</em> on the Seder night: two after the initial <em>berakhot</em>, one for <em>korekh</em>, and one
    more for the <em>afikoman</em> (and for those who are stringent - two more for the <em>afikoman</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Yet is it clear that in principle all measurements are by volume, not weight, as several leading Sephardic <em>poskim -</em> R. Ben-Zion Abba Shaul and R.
    Shalom Messas - have ruled. Since the stringency of measuring matza by weight raises justifiable difficulties and consternation among many participants, we
    may instruct all Jews, Sephardic and Ashkenazic alike, that a <em>kezayit</em> is a third of a machine matza.
    <button type="button" id="1021" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 21</button>
</p>
<a name="25"></a><h2>25. How Much Is a <em>Shi'ur Akhilat Pras</em>?</h2>
<p>
We have now seen that in order to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza, as well as any other Torah commandment governing eating, one must eat at least a    <em>kezayit</em>. One condition must now be added: it is only considered a single act of eating if it is completed within the amount of time it takes to
eat half a loaf of bread, or a <em>shi'ur akhilat pras</em>. If one eats half a <em>kezayit</em>, waits ten minutes, and then eats another half a    <em>kezayit</em>, it is as if he has only eaten half a <em>kezayit</em>, and hence he has not fulfilled the mitzva (SA 475:6).
</p>
<p>
    In the past, people would bake loaves of bread that would feed one person for a day - half a loaf (a <em>pras</em>) at each of the two main meals.
</p>
<p>
    Once again, our long exile has caused disagreement among <em>poskim</em> over the precise size of a <em>pras</em>: according to Rambam, it is the volume of
    three eggs, and according to Rashi, four eggs. Several leading Aharonim tried to measure how long it takes to eat a <em>pras</em>, and many opinions have
    been offered: nine minutes (<em>Hatam</em> <em>Sofer</em>), seven and a half minutes (<em>Arukh</em> <em>La-ner</em>), seven minutes, six minutes, five
    minutes, and four minutes (R. Hayim Naeh and <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em>).
</p>
<p>
    However, all these opinions relate only to a <em>be-di'avad</em> situation, because <em>le-khathila</em> one should eat the matza continuously, and whoever
    does so certainly fulfills his obligation. In addition, there is no need to look at the clock while eating the matza, because any ordinary person who eats
    casually but without interruption will certainly finish eating in time. Even a slow eater, if he does not stop to do other things, will assuredly finish
    eating a <em>kezayit</em> within a <em>shi'ur akhilat</em> <em>pras</em>, because a <em>pras</em> is eight or nine times the size of a <em>kezayit</em>,
    and it is inconceivable that one who eats a <em>kezayit</em> without stopping will not finish in the time it takes to eat eight or nine times that amount.
    <button type="button" id="1022" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 22</button>
</p>
<a name="26"></a><h2>26. How the Matza Is Eaten</h2>
<p>
    Hands are now washed with a <em>berakha</em>, and the Seder leader holds up the three <em>matzot</em> and recites the <em>berakha</em> of "Who brings forth
    bread from the earth" ("<em>ha-motzi lehem min ha-aretz</em>"). The top and bottom <em>matzot</em>, which are whole, constitute <em>lehem mishneh</em>.
After this <em>berakha</em>, he puts down the bottom matza so that he is left with the whole top matza and the broken middle matza (which represents "    <em>lehem oni" - </em>the "bread of poverty") and recites the <em>berakha </em>"Who sanctified us with His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us concerning
eating matza" ("<em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu al akhilat matza</em>"). Then he takes a <em>kezayit</em> from the upper, whole matza, and a    <em>kezayit</em> from the middle matza, and eats them together.
</p>
<p>
    If there are many participants, it makes sense to add more <em>matzot</em> to the bottom matza, so that portions can be given to everybody. Once the Seder
    leader has finished distributing from the middle, broken matza, he no longer needs to give two <em>kezeytim</em> to the remaining participants, only one.
    Only when one distributes portions from the middle matza is it necessary to give a <em>kezayit</em> from the broken matza and a <em>kezayit</em> from the
    whole matza, but when the broken matza is finished, one gives only a <em>kezayit</em> to each person. However, as we have seen, in order to satisfy the
    opinion that today's eggs are smaller than those of the Sages' time, it is better to give each participant the equivalent of two-thirds of a machine-made
    matza. It makes no difference whether this is given from one matza or from parts of two <em>matzot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The Seder leader should taste a little bit of the matza before distributing portions, in order to avoid an interruption between the <em>berakha</em> and
    the eating. After distributing matza to everybody, he reclines and eats two <em>kezeytim</em> with the intention of fulfilling the mitzva.
</p>
<p>
    According to Sephardic custom, the Seder leader dips the matza in salt before distributing it to the participants, just as he does throughout the year. The
    custom of Ashkenazic Jews, on the other hand, is not to dip the matza in salt, because without salt it appears much more like <em>lehem oni</em> (SA
    475:1).
</p>
<p>
Some people have a custom of giving each participant three <em>matzot</em>, so that everyone can have a <em>kezayit</em> from a whole matza and a    <em>kezayit</em> of a broken matza, and neither the leader nor the participants have to wait to receive matza after the <em>berakha</em>. But the
widespread custom is that the Seder leader distributes matza to everybody, and the fact that everyone eats together and that the Seder leader recited the    <em>berakhot </em>on everyone's behalf enhances the mitzva. Others have a custom to put out three <em>matzot</em> before the head of each household, who
    distributes portions to his family members. Even though each of these practices is fine, it is best for the head of each household to distribute matza to
    his family members.
</p>
<p>
The matza is eaten while reclining. One should have in mind to fulfill the Torah commandment, remembering that it is eaten in commemoration of the    <em>matzot</em> our forefathers ate when they left Egypt for freedom.
</p>
<a name="27"></a><h2>27. The Mitzva to Eat <em>Maror</em>
</h2>
<p>
    The Torah commandment to eat <em>maror</em> on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan is contingent upon the eating of the Paschal sacrifice, as it states:
    "They shall eat it with <em>matzot</em> and <em>merorim</em> [plural of <em>maror</em>]" (Bamidbar 9:11). Since we are unable to offer the Paschal
    sacrifice today, the mitzva to eat <em>maror</em> is now rabbinic (<em>Pesahim</em> 120a). We dip the <em>maror</em> in <em>haroset</em> in order to
counteract its bitterness, and then we shake off all the <em>haroset</em> that sticks to it, because <em>haroset</em> should not be eaten with the    <em>maror</em> (SA 475:1, MB 13 and <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 23 <em>ad loc.</em>). After this we recite the <em>berakha </em>"Who sanctified us with
His <em>mitzvot</em> and commanded us concerning eating <em>maror</em>" ("<em>asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu al akhilat maror</em>"), and eat a    <em>kezayit</em> of <em>maror</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The Sages enumerate five types of <em>maror</em>: <em>hazeret</em>, <em>tamha</em>, <em>harhavina</em>, <em>ulshin</em>, and <em>maror</em>. Today we are
only familiar with two of these: <em>hazeret</em>, which is lettuce, and <em>tamha</em>, which is horseradish. The Sages stated that the choicest type of    <em>maror</em> is lettuce, and its Hebrew name ("<em>hasa</em>") even alludes to the fact that God has mercy ("<em>has</em>") upon us. They also tell us
    that the Egyptian enslavement was like <em>maror</em>: just as <em>maror</em> begins soft and ends hard - the stalk starts off soft and later hardens - so
    too the enslavement began "softly" and became harder and bitterer with time (<em>Pesahim</em> 39a).
</p>
<p>
Several Aharonim questioned whether we fulfill the obligation of <em>maror</em> with today's lettuce, which is not bitter at all. Indeed, according to    <em>Hazon</em> <em>Ish</em>, one may fulfill one's obligation only with lettuce that has become somewhat bitter. In practice, though, the <em>poskim</em>
    concur that one may fulfill one's obligation with lettuce even if it is not bitter, because this was the nature of the bondage: initially the Egyptians
enslaved us with gentle words and paid us for our labor, while gradually intensifying the work until it was bitter as gall. The Yerushalmi (    <em>Pesahim </em>2:5) likewise tells us that lettuce starts out sweet and then becomes bitter. Thus, it is the custom of all Jews to optimize this mitzva
    by using lettuce for <em>maror</em>, because <em>maror</em> need not be bitter when it is eaten; rather, it must be of a species that eventually becomes
    bitter. Some people add a bit of horseradish to their lettuce so that they taste some bitterness.

    Since lettuce often contains bugs, it should be cleaned and checked thoroughly on Erev Pesah. Nowadays there are ways to grow bug-free lettuce, and it is
    best to use such lettuce in order to avoid potentially violating the prohibition against eating bugs.
</p>
<p>
    One must eat a <em>kezayit</em> (half an egg's volume) of <em>maror</em>, and one may estimate this size by sight. As we have learned, some customarily
calculate a <em>kezayit</em> by weight, which is about 29 grams. However, with lettuce there is very little difference between a weight- and volume-based    <em>kezayit</em>.
</p>
<a name="28"></a><h2>28. <em>Korekh</em></h2>
<p>
    After eating the <em>maror</em>, we make a sandwich from a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>maror</em> in a <em>kezayit</em> of matza and dip it in <em>haroset</em>
    . Some people also shake off any <em>haroset</em> that sticks to the <em>maror</em>, as with the eating of <em>maror</em> (MB 475:19). Others do not remove
the <em>haroset</em> from the <em>maror</em> in the case of <em>korekh</em> (<em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 457:32). We then say <em>"zekher</em>    <em>le-Mikdash</em> <em>ke-Hillel"</em> ("in commemoration of the Temple, according to Hillel"), and eat the <em>korekh </em>while reclining (SA 475:1). As
    we learned, a <em>kezayit</em> is about a third of a machine matza.
</p>
<p>
    According to Hillel the Elder, in Temple times the mitzva was fulfilled by eating matza and <em>maror </em>together, as it is stated: "They shall eat it
    with <em>matzot</em> and <em>merorim</em>" (Bamidbar 9:11). According to the other Sages, people would eat the matza and <em>maror</em> separately. Since
    no final decision was reached regarding this matter, we follow both practices.
</p>
<p>
    However, even Hillel would concur that today it is impossible to fulfill one's obligation by eating matza with <em>maror</em>. This is because without the
Paschal sacrifice the mitzva to eat matza remains Torah-based, while eating <em>maror</em> is of rabbinic origin. If they are eaten together, the    <em>maror</em>, which is rabbinic, will detract from the matza, which is from the Torah. Therefore, one must first eat a <em>kezayit</em> of matza. After
this, one eats a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>maror</em> without matza, because the matza obligation has already been fulfilled, and if one eats matza with    <em>maror</em> at this point, the taste of the matza, which is no longer a mitzva, will overshadow the taste of the <em>maror</em>, which is a rabbinic
    mitzva. After fulfilling both <em>mitzvot </em>separately, we put matza and <em>maror </em>together like a sandwich and eat them in commemoration of
    Hillel's practice (<em>Pesahim</em> 115a and <em>Tosafot</em> s.v. <em>"</em>ella<em>"</em>; MB 475:16). And some say that while it is clear that today,
    according to Hillel, the matza must be eaten separately, nonetheless, in order to fulfill the rabbinic mitzva to eat <em>maror</em>, it must be eaten with
    matza. According to this opinion, when we eat the <em>korekh</em>, we are fulfilling the mitzva to eat <em>maror</em> (<em>Pri</em> <em>Hadash</em>).
</p>
<p>
    In any event, according to all opinions one should be careful not to talk until he has finished eating <em>korekh</em>. Indeed, it is customary to refrain
    from talking between the blessing over the matza and that of the <em>maror</em>, until we have finished eating the <em>korekh</em>. It is only permissible
    to talk about matters related to fulfilling the mitzva.

<a name="29"></a><h2>29. Those Who Have Difficulty Eating Matza</h2>
<p>
    As we have learned, a <em>kezayit</em> of matza is about a third of a machine matza, and on the Seder night we must eat four or five pieces of this size.
After the <em>berakhot </em>of <em>"ha-motzi"</em> and <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza,"</em> we eat two <em>kezeytim</em>: one for    <em>"ha-motzi"</em> and one for <em>"akhilat</em> <em>matza</em>,<em>"</em> and in order to fulfill the stringent opinion (<em>Hazon</em> <em>Ish</em>),
which maintains that a <em>kezayit</em> is twice the accepted size. We eat another <em>kezayit</em> for <em>korekh</em>, and one more for the<em>afikoman</em>, though some practice the stringency of eating two <em>kezeytim</em> for the <em>afikoman</em>: one in memory of the Paschal sacrifice     itself, and one in commemoration of the matza that would be eaten with it.
</p>
<p>
If one finds it difficult to eat a matza and a third (or two-thirds), he should do his best to eat the initial two-thirds of a matza as    <em>matzat mitzva</em>, in order to fulfill the mitzva in accordance with all of the different opinions. After this, it is sufficient to eat a
fifth of a matza for <em>korekh</em> and another fifth for the <em>afikoman</em>. If even this is difficult, one can eat a third of a matza - a    <em>kezayit </em>according to the standard measure - to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza, and recite a <em>berakha</em> over it. In other words, during
    the entire Seder, he would eat one third of a matza followed by an additional two-fifths.
    <button type="button" id="1025" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 25</button>
</p>
<p>
    If one has difficulty chewing the matza - for example, one who has no teeth - he may crumble it up and eat the crumbs (BHL 461:4). If even this is too
    difficult, he may soak the matza in water before eating it. However, if one boils the matza or soaks it until it dissolves, he does not fulfill the mitzva
    with it, because it no longer has the taste of matza (SA 461:4, MB 19, 20).
</p>
<p>
    It is forbidden, however, to soak the matza in wine, soup, or any other beverage that has a taste, because some believe that this weakens the taste of the
    matza. Some maintain that even dipping the matza in such liquids is improper. Nevertheless, a sick or elderly person who cannot eat the matza even if it
    were soaked in water may soak it in another liquid if it would help, recite a <em>berakha</em> over it, and eat it. But if a normal healthy person eats
matza that has been soaked in a liquid, he must eat another <em>kezayit</em> of matza (MB 461:18, SHT 32 and <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 47-48    <em>ad loc.</em>).
    <button type="button" id="1026" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 26</button>
</p>
<a name="30"></a><h2>30. Those Exempt from Matza and <em>Maror</em></h2>
<p>
    One who is incapable of eating a <em>kezayit</em> of matza (one third of a matza) should at least try to eat a portion of matza equivalent to a modern-day
olive, because some <em>poskim</em> maintain that this is the true size of a <em>kezayit</em>. However, one may not recite the <em>berakha </em>of    <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza"</em> over this amount of matza, because most <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is insufficient for fulfilling the
    mitzva to eat matza. If one cannot eat even the volume of a modern-day olive, it is still good to eat as much matza as possible, even a small amount.
    <button type="button" id="1027" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 27</button>
</p>
<p>
Regarding one who knows that eating matza will cause him to become ill or intensify an existing illness but will certainly not threaten his life, the<em>poskim</em> disagree over whether he is obligated to eat matza: according to R. Shlomo of Vilna, such a person is exempt from eating matza on Pesah (    <em>Binyan</em> <em>Shlomo</em> �47), whereas according to Maharam Schick, a sick person is only exempt from eating matza where there is mortal danger (OH
�260). The custom is to rule in accordance with the lenient opinion. (Regarding <em>maror</em> and the four cups of wine, which are rabbinic    <em>mitzvot</em>, there is a consensus that one who will be consigned to bed if he eats them is exempt, as explained in section 7.)
</p>
<p>
    According to this, most people who suffer from celiac disease must eat a <em>kezayit</em> of matza on the Seder night, because a <em>kezayit</em> of matza
    will not cause them to become sick. Even if it will cause one to suffer somewhat, this is not considered sickness. However, people who suffer from severe
celiac disease, and who know that they are liable to have a strong reaction to matza, are exempt from the mitzva of eating matza. Nowadays one can find    <em>matzot</em> made from oatmeal and spelt flour, which are better than wheat matza for people with celiac disease.

</p>
<a name="31"></a><h2>31. The Time for Eating the Matza, <em>Maror</em>, and <em>Afikoman</em></h2>
<p>
    The matza and <em>maror</em> must be eaten by midnight (the midpoint of the night, regardless of the time on the clock), but if one was unable to eat them
    before midnight, he should eat them after midnight without a <em>berakha</em>. <em>Le-khathila</em>, even the <em>afikoman</em> should be eaten before
    midnight.
</p>
<p>
    The basis for this law lies in a dispute between two Sages of the Mishna, R. Elazar b. Azarya and R. Akiva. According to R. Elazar b. Azarya, the Paschal
    sacrifice could be eaten only until midnight, and no later, because it was at midnight that the firstborns of Egypt were struck down, and the Egyptians
    began frantically trying to send the Israelites out of Egypt. According to R. Akiva, the matza may be eaten all night, until dawn, because it was at this
    time that the Israelites hurried to leave Egypt (<em>Pesahim</em> 120b).
</p>
<p>
    From a spiritual perspective, we must explain that the offering and eating of the Paschal sacrifice revealed the unique quality of Israel, and this
    therefore constituted a preparation for the redemption. Accordingly, the meat of the <em>korban Pesah </em>is eaten each year until the time of the
    redemption's onset. The question is: which phase of redemption determines the time to stop eating the Paschal sacrifice? According to R. Elazar b. Azarya,
    the redemption started at midnight, when the firstborns of Egypt were struck down, for it was then that Egyptians' power was broken and they could no
    longer enslave us. Therefore, the Paschal sacrifice is eaten until midnight. However, according to R. Akiva, the complete redemption did not arrive until
morning, when we went forth to freedom. Therefore, the entire night is a preparation for redemption, and it follows that one may eat the meat of the    <em>korban Pesah</em> all night.
</p>
<p>
    Let us now return to the <em>halakha</em>. The time for eating the Paschal sacrifice also determines the time for eating matza and <em>maror</em>, because
    matza and <em>maror</em> were eaten together with the Paschal sacrifice, as it is stated, "They shall eat it with <em>matzot</em> and <em>merorim</em>"
    (Bamidbar 9:11). It follows that the time for eating matza is the same as the time for eating the Paschal sacrifice. The <em>afikoman</em>, which is eaten
    in commemoration of the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em>, must also be eaten at a time that is appropriate for eating the Paschal sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
    Leading Rishonim disagree about which opinion to follow in practice. According to Rambam and <em>Itur</em>, the <em>halakha </em>follows R. Akiva, because,
    as a rule, we follow R. Akiva whenever he takes issue with one of his contemporaries. Thus, the <em>korban Pesah </em>may be eaten throughout the entire
    night, and by extension so can matza, <em>maror</em>, and the <em>afikoman</em>. On the other hand, Rabbeinu Hananel and Rosh maintain that because the
    Mishna<em>,</em> in several places, states without dissent that the time for eating the <em>korban Pesah</em> is until midnight, we may conclude that R.
    Yehuda Ha-Nasi, who compiled the Mishna, rules that on this issue the <em>halakha</em> follows R. Elazar b. Azarya.
</p>
<p>
    Since this issue is subject to dispute, a <em>kezayit</em> of matza must be eaten before midnight, because according to those who maintain that the Paschal
    sacrifice may be eaten until midnight, eating it after midnight fails to fulfill the Torah commandment. Since the destruction of the Temple, <em>maror</em>
    has been a rabbinic enactment, and although we generally follow the lenient opinion with regard to rabbinic laws, <em>maror</em> must nevertheless be eaten
    before midnight since we recite a <em>berakha </em>over it. If circumstances prevented one from eating the matza and <em>maror</em> before midnight, he
should eat them after midnight, in order to fulfill the mitzva according to R. Akiva's opinion. However, he should not recite the <em>berakhot </em>of<em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>matza"</em> and <em>"al</em> <em>akhilat</em> <em>maror</em>," so as to avoid reciting a <em>berakha </em>in vain ("    <em>le-vatala</em>") according to the opinion of R. Elazar b. Azarya (MB 477:6; <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 10 <em>ad loc</em>.).
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the <em>afikoman</em>, SA rules (477:1) that one must, <em>le-khathila,</em> eat it before midnight, in order to fulfill the mitzva according to
    all <em>poskim</em>. Similarly, <em>Hallel</em> should also be completed before midnight <em>le-khathila</em>, because it is connected to the telling of
    the Exodus story, which must be told at a time appropriate for eating matza.
</p>
<p>
    There were Torah scholars who, <em>le-khathila</em>, ate the <em>afikoman</em> after midnight, reasoning that the <em>afikoman</em> is a rabbinic
    enactment and we may thus rely upon the lenient opinion that it may be eaten after midnight. However, with regard to the initial <em>kezayit</em> of matza,
    which is a Torah commandment, and the <em>maror</em>, over which we recite a <em>berakha</em>, one may not adopt the lenient position and eat them before
    midnight.

</p>
<a name="32"></a><h2>32. Meal Customs: Roasted Foods, Eggs</h2>
<p>
    During the time of the Mishna, some communities had a custom to refrain from eating roast meat on Pesah night, since it would look like they were eating
    the meat of the Paschal sacrifice - which must be roasted - outside the precincts of Jerusalem. Elsewhere, people did eat roast meat on Pesah but did not
    roast a whole lamb, which would really look like offering the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em> outside the Temple. The Sages stated that each custom is
    valid: where the custom is to refrain from roasted meat, one should not eat it, and where the custom is to eat it, one may (<em>Pesahim</em> 53a). In
practice, Yemeni Jews customarily eat roasted meat on Pesah night, but all Ashkenazim and most Sephardim customarily prohibit roasted meat on Pesah night (    <em>Ben</em> <em>Ish</em> <em>Hai</em>, Year One, Tzav 30; <em>Hazon</em> <em>Ovadia</em> p. 175). We shall now specify the details of this prohibition:
</p>
<p>
    The prohibition against roasted meat applies to all types of meat, even from species that could not be used as the <em>korban Pesah</em>, such as beef and
    fowl<em>.</em> However, one may roast foods that do not require ritual slaughtering, such as fish and eggs (SA 476:2). Though the meat of the Paschal
    sacrifice was roasted over the fire and not in a pot, pot roast is nevertheless forbidden, because it looks like meat roasted over fire. It is likewise
    forbidden to eat meat that was first cooked and then roasted, because it looks roasted. However, meat that was first roasted may be cooked and eaten on the
    Seder night, because it looks cooked (MB 476:1; <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 4 <em>ad loc.</em>).
    <button type="button" id="1030" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 30</button>
</p>
<p>
    Some have a custom to eat eggs during the Seder meal in order to recall the destruction of the Temple, as eggs are a sign of mourning, and because the
    first day of Pesah always falls on the same day of the week as Tisha Be-Av (Rema 476:2). The Vilna Gaon explains that eggs commemorate the pilgrimage
    sacrifice (<em>korban</em> <em>hagiga</em>) that was eaten on the Seder night before the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em>. Therefore, the custom is to eat
the egg from the Seder plate during the meal, as it is placed there to commemorate the <em>korban</em> <em>hagiga</em> (MB 476:11; <em>Kaf</em>    <em>Ha-hayim</em> 25-26 <em>ad loc</em>.). Some people refrain from eating the egg from the Seder plate in order to keep the plate intact; they eat it on
    the following day (<em>Ma'amar</em> <em>Mordechai</em> 473:1). However, the widespread custom is to eat the egg from the Seder plate at the Seder.
</p>
<p>
    As on any other Yom Tov, a distinguished feast should be prepared for the Seder night, with fine utensils and festive delicacies. One may drink wine during
    the meal; this is not considered adding to the four cups. However, one must be careful not to eat and drink too much, because the <em>afikoman</em> must be
    eaten with an appetite at the end of the meal (see below, section 33), and because one must be able to continue reciting the <em>Hallel</em> and the
    concluding songs without becoming too tired.
</p>
<a name="33"></a><h2>33. <em>Tzafun</em> - the <em>Afikoman</em></h2>
<p>
    After the Seder meal, we eat a <em>kezayit</em> (about a third of a machine matza) of the broken matza that was set aside at the beginning of the Seder.
    This matza is called the <em>afikoman</em>. After eating the <em>afikoman</em>, we do not eat anything else until we go to sleep, so that the taste of the
matza lingers in our mouths (SA 477:1, 478:1). If the <em>afikoman</em> set aside at the beginning is not big enough to give each participant a    <em>kezayit</em>, the Seder leader gives each participant a small piece of the <em>afikoman</em> together with additional <em>shmura </em>matza to
constitute a <em>kezayit</em>. If there is not enough <em>afikoman</em> to give even a small piece to each participant, the leader may give out    <em>shmura </em>matza to be eaten as the <em>afikoman</em>. Likewise, if the <em>afikoman</em> was lost, one may use a different piece of <em>shmura </em>
    matza instead (Rema 477:2).
</p>
<p>
    One may drink water after eating the <em>afikoman</em>. After all, eating after the <em>afikoman</em> is prohibited only so its taste stays in our mouths,
    and water has no taste (SA 478:1, MB 2 <em>ad loc.</em>).
</p>
<p>
    The word "<em>afikoman</em>" originally meant "dessert." On the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, the last thing one eats must be the meat of the Paschal
sacrifice, so that its taste lingers with us, as the Mishna states: "after the Paschal sacrifice, we do not conclude with dessert (<em>afikoman</em>)" (    <em>Pesahim </em>119b).
</p>
<p>
    Since we can no longer offer the <em>korban Pesah</em>, the Sages ordained eating matza at the end of the Seder to commemorate the <em>korban Pesah</em>.
    So that the taste of this matza remains in our mouths, nothing may be eaten after it. Since this matza is the final course of the Seder, it is in essence
    dessert. Therefore we call it "<em>afikoman.</em>"
</p>
<p>
    SA 477:1 explains that the <em>afikoman</em> commemorates the <em>korban</em> <em>Pesah</em>, and just as the Paschal sacrifice was eaten "while satisfied"
    ("<em>al ha-sova</em>"), so too the <em>afikoman</em> must be eaten while satisfied. "<em>Al ha-sova</em>" means that one is already satiated but still
    wants to eat more. However, if one is so full that his appetite is gone, he does not fulfill the mitzva in the ideal manner, since he would prefer not to
eat any more. If one is so stuffed that food is repugnant to him, but he nonetheless forces himself to eat the <em>afikoman</em>, this is called<em>akhila</em> <em>gasa</em> (gross overconsumption), which is not considered eating at all. One who does so does not fulfill the mitzva of eating the    <em>afikoman</em> (MB 476:6, <em>Kaf</em> <em>Ha-hayim</em> 17 <em>ad loc.</em>).
</p>
<p>
    The <em>afikoman</em> must be eaten in one place, because it commemorates the Paschal sacrifice, which had to be eaten in one place, as it is stated
    (Shemot 12:46): "It should be eaten in one house" (Rema 478:1, MB 4 <em>ad loc.</em>).
</p>
<a name="34"></a><h2>34. The <em>Afikoman</em>: Two Reasons, Two <em>Kezeytim</em></h2>
<p>
As we have seen, according to most authorities the <em>afikoman</em> commemorates the Paschal sacrifice, which was eaten at the end of the meal (    <em>Ha-ma'or</em>, Ramban, <em>Or Zaru'a</em>, Rosh, etc.). However, according to several major Rishonim (Rashi, Rashbam), the <em>afikoman</em> is
actually the fulfillment of the fundamental mitzva of eating matza, which, they explain, must be eaten at the end of the meal along with the    <em>korban Pesah</em>. Since the Paschal sacrifice had to be eaten while satisfied, so must the matza. And even though we recite the <em>berakha</em> over
the matza at the beginning of the meal, in their opinion the basic intention to fulfill the mitzva to eat matza must be at the end of the meal, when the    <em>afikoman</em> is eaten.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Le-khathila</em>
, it is good to have both of these reasons - to commemorate the <em>korban Pesah </em>and to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza - in mind while eating the    <em>afikoman</em>. According to both opinions, the <em>afikoman</em> must be eaten while reclining to the left. However, if one forgets to recline, there
is a difference between them: according to the opinion that the <em>afikoman</em> commemorates the <em>korban Pesah</em>, one need not eat another<em>afikoman</em> while reclining. According to the opinion that the <em>afikoman</em> fulfills the mitzva of eating matza, reclining is a    <em>sine qua non</em>. Therefore, if one forgot to recline while eating the <em>afikoman</em>, he should preferably eat a second one while reclining.
    However, if one is full and will have a hard time eating another <em>kezayit</em> of matza, he need not eat the <em>afikoman</em> a second time; he may
    rely on the mainstream opinion that the <em>afikoman</em> commemorates the <em>korban Pesah</em>. Moreover, even according to Rashbam, since one intended
    to fulfill the mitzva of eating matza at the beginning of the meal, he has fulfilled his obligation even though, for Rashbam, that was not the proper time
    to have such intention. Therefore, failing to recline while eating the <em>afikoman</em> no longer prevents the fulfillment of the mitzva.
</p>
<p>
    Some have a custom to eat two <em>kezeytim</em> of the <em>afikoman</em>, either because they want to show how desirable the matza is and thus eat a
    sizable portion to become fully satiated (Maharil), or because they want to allude to both reasons for eating the <em>afikoman</em>: one <em>kezayit</em>
    commemorates the <em>korban Pesah</em> and another fulfills the mitzva to eat matza (<em>Bah</em>). However, this is not obligatory, and if one does not
    want to eat two <em>kezeytim</em>, he may eat just one and still keep both reasons in mind.
</p>
<p>
    We have seen that, simply stated, a <em>kezayit</em> is about a third of a machine-made matza, and two <em>kezeytim</em> are about two-thirds. This is
    based on <em>Tosafot</em>'s stringent opinion about the size of a <em>kezayit</em>. In light of the fact that the <em>afikoman</em> is a rabbinic mitzva
and that consumption of two <em>kezeytim</em> is subject to disagreement, one may certainly fulfill the mitzva of <em>afikoman </em>with a single    <em>kezayit</em> of one third of a matza and, if necessary, with one fifth of a matza (based on Rambam's smaller <em>kezayit</em>). And we have already
    learned that whoever eats the matza without interruption will certainly finish it within a <em>shi'ur akhilat pras</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1031" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 31</button>
</p>
<a name="35"></a><h2>35. <em>Hallel</em> the Great <em>Hallel</em>, and the Concluding <em>Berakha</em></h2>
<p>
After <em>Birkat</em> <em>Ha-mazon</em>, we drink the third cup of wine and then pour the fourth cup, over which we recite <em>Hallel</em> and "the Great"    <em>Hallel</em> ("<em>Hallel Ha-gadol</em>"). Before <em>Hallel</em> we recite the paragraph "<em>Shefokh</em> <em>Hamatkha</em>" ("Pour Your
    Wrath"). Some customarily open the door at this point to demonstrate that, on this night, we are protected against destructive forces and not afraid of our
    enemies. By virtue of this faith, the <em>Mashi'ah</em> (Messiah) will come and pour out his wrath upon the wicked enemies of Israel (Rema 480:1). Some
have a custom to stand while reciting <em>Shefokh</em> <em>Hamatkha</em> (AHS <em>ad loc</em>., and this was the practice of Rav Kook). After reciting    <em>Shefokh</em> <em>Hamatkha</em>, we close the door.
</p>
<p>
    We then continue with the second part of <em>Hallel</em> (see above, section 20). There is a mitzva to recite verses 1-4 and 24-25 of Tehilim 118
    responsively, led by the eldest member of the household. There is a mitzva to ensure that three adults are present in order to recite the verses in this
    manner, with one leader and multiple respondents (Rema 479:1). This is all <em>le-khathila</em>; of course, an individual fulfills the mitzva even by
    reciting <em>Hallel</em> alone. If only two people are present, they should recite the verses together (MB 479:10-11).<u></u>
</p>
<p>
After this, we recite the Great <em>Hallel </em>(chapter 136 of Tehilim) followed by <em>Nishmat Kol Hai </em>("The Soul of All Life") and the concluding<em>berakha</em>. There are different opinions regarding the formula of the concluding <em>berakha</em>: Sephardim close with the paragraph "    <em>Yehallelukha</em>," which concludes the normal recitation of <em>Hallel</em>. Ashkenazim close with "<em>Yishtabah</em>," which concludes the psalms of
    praise recited at <em>Shaharit </em>(see section 31 above, where we learned that it is better to complete this <em>berakha</em> by midnight). Following
    this, we sing various songs composed in the period of the Rishonim.
</p>
<p>
    Logic dictates that the fourth cup should be drunk right after the concluding <em>berakha </em>of <em>Hallel</em>, which also concludes the Seder that was
    instituted by the Sages in the times of the Mishna. The songs and poems that follow are merely a custom. Nevertheless, some drink the fourth cup after
    singing a few of these additional songs, so that they too are sung over a cup of wine and are thus included in the Seder (see MB 480:6). Each family should
    continue its own tradition.
</p>
<p>
    The Sephardic custom is not to recite "<em>ha-gefen</em>" before the fourth cup, whereas the Ashkenazic custom is to recite it (see section 21
    above). After the fourth cup, the <em>berakha aharona </em>of <em>"Al</em> <em>Ha-gefen</em>" is said.
</p>
<a name="36"></a><h2>36. The Fifth Cup - Eliyahu's Cup</h2>
<p>
    A significant halakhic uncertainty arose concerning the fifth cup. Some say that there is an extra special mitzva to drink a fifth cup;
    the fourth cup should be drunk at the end of the <em>Hallel</em> and the fifth cup after the concluding <em>berakha.</em> Others say that the fifth cup is
    merely the Sages' recommendation for one who wishes to continue drinking after the fourth cup. Still others say it is forbidden to drink a fifth cup.
    <button type="button" id="1032" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 32</button>
</p>
<p>
    The customary practice is not to drink a fifth cup, though we do pour one, called Eliyahu's Cup. The Vilna Gaon explains how it got this name: when there
    is an uncertainty that cannot be resolved, we believe that when the prophet Eliyahu returns as a harbinger of the messianic era, he will resolve it. Thus,
    we pour a fifth cup in his honor, and when he arrives he will tell us if we should drink it.
</p>
<p>
    We can interpret this issue in a deeper way as well. The Sages instituted the four cups to signify the four expressions of redemption used in reference to
    the Exodus from Egypt: "I will rescue you... I will save you... I will redeem you... I will take you..." (Shemot 6:6-7). An additional expression of redemption is
    mentioned there: "<strong>I will bring you</strong> to the land" (<em>ibid. </em>8). However, since this does not relate to the Exodus itself, the Sages do
    not obligate us to drink a corresponding fifth cup. They tell us, however, that there is a mitzva to drink a fifth cup in order to allude to the complete
    redemption, which begins with our entry into Eretz Yisrael.
</p>
<p>
    It could also be that the uncertainty about the fifth cup stems from the question as to whether it is proper to drink a fifth cup after the destruction of
    the Temple and during the long exile. Perhaps after the Temple's destruction we can only celebrate with those cups that allude to our Exodus from the
    Egyptian bondage, since this will forever distinguish us. Even if the nations of the world subjugate our bodies, our souls remain eternally free; ever
    since the Exodus, it has been clear that we are God's uniquely chosen people, that we received the Torah, and that all the hardships that have come upon us
    have not broken our faith in God, our Redeemer. Therefore, we drink four cups of wine corresponding to the four expressions of redemption from Egypt. The
    fifth cup, though, does not correspond to our emancipation alone; rather, it alludes to the complete redemption, which depends on our entry into Eretz
    Yisrael, where the word of God is revealed in all spheres of life, through the Torah and prophecy, and through God's blessing, which inheres in the
    building of the nation and the land. This notion of the Temple is that it joins heaven and earth and reveals the divine unity that nourishes everything.
    Indeed, the number five alludes to the inner, unifying point at the center of the four compass directions. And so perhaps at the source of the uncertainty
    about the fifth cup lies the question: is it fitting, in light of the Temple's destruction, to drink the fifth cup, which alludes to the complete
    redemption?
</p>
<p>
    The solution is to pour a fifth cup but not drink it as part of the Seder until Eliyahu appears. His very appearance will show us that the time has come to
    drink the fifth cup, celebrating our complete redemption.
</p>
<p>
    The custom is to pour Eliyahu's Cup after drinking the third cup; when we pour the fourth cup for everybody, we pour a cup for Eliyahu as well. The custom
    is to leave Eliyahu's Cup covered until morning, when we pour the wine back into the bottle and then use it for the morning <em>kiddush</em>.

<a name="37"></a><h2>37. Drinking Coffee or Juice after the Seder</h2>
<p>
    We have learned that the Sages ordained the <em>afikoman</em> at the end of the Seder to commemorate the <em>korban Pesah</em>, which was eaten "while
    satisfied." Just as it was forbidden to eat any other food after the Paschal sacrifice, so that its taste lingered, so too the Sages forbade eating after
    the <em>afikoman</em>.
    <button type="button" id="1034" onclick="ok.performClick(id);">note 34</button>
</p>
<p>
    It is also forbidden to drink wine after the <em>afikoman</em>, for several reasons. If one has not yet finished reciting the Hagada, he might become
    intoxicated and be unable to finish reciting <em>Hallel</em> properly; furthermore, by drinking an additional cup of wine, one will appear to be adding to
    the number of cups instituted by the Sages.
</p>
<p>
    It is even forbidden to drink wine after the Seder, because there is a mitzva to delve into the laws of Pesah and the Exodus story until one is overcome
    with sleep, and if one drinks wine or some other intoxicating beverage, he will not be able to do so (Rabbeinu Yona, Rosh). Furthermore, even though the
    Seder is over, if one drinks additional cups of wine he may still appear to be adding to the cups instituted by the Sages, or starting a new series of cups
    (Ramban, Ran).
</p>
<p>
    Some <em>poskim</em> maintain that it is even forbidden to drink coffee or juice after the <em>afikoman</em> until one goes to sleep, because any flavored
    food or drink weakens the taste of the <em>afikoman</em> in one's mouth, so just as it is forbidden to eat after the <em>afikoman</em>, so is it forbidden
    to drink anything flavored. To be sure, we drink two more cups of wine after the <em>afikoman</em>, but since these are part of the mitzva, they are not
    seen as weakening the taste of the mitzva. According to this, only water may be drunk after the Seder.
</p>
<p>
    However, in contrast to these <em>poskim</em>, many other <em>poskim</em> permit drinking coffee or juice. They maintain that beverages are not included in
    the prohibition, because only food is seen as weakening the taste of the <em>afikoman</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, if one wishes to drink coffee or juice after the Seder, he may, as this is the opinion of most <em>poskim</em>. But preferably one should be
    stringent and avoid drinking anything except water. If one wishes to drink coffee so that he will be able to continue delving into the laws of Pesah and
    the Exodus story, he may, even <em>le-khathila</em>.

</p>
<a name="38"></a><h2>38. Recounting the Exodus and Studying the Laws of Pesah All Night</h2>
<p>
    Some have a custom to read Shir Ha-shirim (the Song of Songs) upon completing the Hagada, as it alludes to the love between God and Israel.
</p>
<p>
    Though we have fulfilled our obligation to tell the story of the Exodus by reading the Hagada, there is a mitzva to continue embellishing the story and
    telling of the miracles and wonders that God did for our ancestors throughout the night of the fifteenth, until one is overcome with sleep. This mitzva
    includes studying the laws of Pesah (SA 481:2; <em>Gevurot Hashem</em> ch. 2), but it does not include "<em>pilpul</em>" (talmudic
    casuistry) (<em>Derashot</em> <em>Hatam</em> <em>Sofer</em> p. 265).
</p>
<p>
    It is best not to spend a lot of time on the portion of the Hagada that precedes the meal, because we want the children and all of the participants to
    remain alert until the fourth cup. But after finishing the Hagada, there is a mitzva to continue discussing the Exodus as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
If one fears that by staying up late he will be unable to pray <em>Shaharit</em> properly, it is better that he goes to bed earlier (<em>Sidur</em>    <em>Yaavetz</em>). An effort should nonetheless be made to continue relating the story of the Exodus until after midnight (<em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 481:11).
</p>
<p>
    Before going to sleep on Pesah night, it is customary to recite <em>Shema </em>and the <em>berakha </em>of <em>Ha-mapil</em>, but not to read the other
    verses that are read on all other nights. These verses are recited as a protective remedy against harmful forces, but this night is safeguarded against
    such forces and opportune for redemption (Rema 481:2; and see <em>Ben</em> <em>Ish</em> <em>Hai</em>, Tzav 38).
</p>
<p>
    May it be God's will that just as we have merited to study the <em>halakhot </em>of the Seder, so may we merit to fulfill them.

            . <em>Kiddush </em>on Shabbat is clearly a Torah precept, as it states: "Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it." According to Rambam and
            the majority of <em>poskim, </em>one fulfills his Torah obligation to remember Shabbat by reciting the Friday night prayers. The Sages,
            however, instituted that <em>kiddush </em>be recited over wine. According to some Rishonim, the biblical mitzva is to sanctify the Shabbat over a
            cup of wine.

            With regard to <em>kiddush </em>on Yom Tov, the <em>poskim</em> disagree whether it is from the Torah or of rabbinic origin. <em>Magid Mishneh</em>
            on MT Laws of Shabbat 29:18 states that <em>kiddush </em>on Yom Tov is rabbinic, and this is also the opinion of MA 271:1 and
most Aharonim. Conversely, many Rishonim -<em> She'iltot</em>, <em>Behag, </em>Raavya, and Maharam of Rothenburg - maintain that<em>kiddush </em>on Yom Tov is from the Torah, as it states: "These are the festivals of God, that you shall call holy."

            . In the past, it was only possible to obtain grape juice during the grape harvest. Since last season's wine would have already been used up and it
            would take another forty days to prepare wine from the new crop, the Sages permitted making <em>kiddush </em>on grape juice (BB 97b; SA
            272:2). This is <em>be-di'avad</em>, especially when it comes to the Seder, where reciting the Hagada joyfully is an integral part of the
            institution. This argument is also advanced in <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> 2:35, although in the notes on p. 130 the author advocates that women may
fulfill the mitzva using grape juice. He argues that the reason for using intoxicating wine is to fulfill the mitzva of rejoicing on Yom Tov.            <em>Pesahim</em> 109a states: "Every person must rejoice during the festival... men with what is appropriate for them - with wine, and
            women... in Babylonia with dyed clothing and in Eretz Yisrael with pressed linen clothing." SA 529:2 and BHL<em> ad loc.</em> rule that, indeed, the
            joy of wine relates primarily to men.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Nevertheless, the most straightforward understanding of this mitzva requires women to drink the four cups of wine just like men, as "they too
            participated in that miracle" (<em>Pesahim </em>108b). Until recent generations, this was the common practice of women. Nevertheless, intoxication
            is more disgraceful for women than for men (<em>Ketubot</em> 65a), so women concerned about intoxication may mix more grape juice into their wine.

            . <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim</em> 472:1 states, based on <em>Zohar,</em> that one should rinse the cup again before <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>. Some
            had the custom of preparing a basin of water and immersing the cups in it between each drinking. Nowadays, this practice is not as nice, since the
water in the bowl becomes dirty; we would not consider such cups clean. One who wants to be strict should rinse his glass in the sink. Most            <em>poskim</em> maintain that one need not rinse out the cups in the middle of the Seder.

            . According to Ramban<em>,</em> cited as an alternative opinion in SA 472:9, one must drink the majority of the cup, no matter how large. However,
most <em>poskim</em> maintain that although it is preferable to follow Ramban, one fulfills the obligation without meeting that condition (MB            <em>ad loc. </em>33). Although the accepted opinion is the primary one, in this context I stressed that following the Hazon Ish <em>shi'ur </em>
enhances the mitzva, since more wine adds to the mitzva of rejoicing and those who want to enhance the mitzva always drank more than the minimum            <em>revi'it</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
Thus, to satisfy unquestionably all opinions one should preferably use a cup that contains 150 ml and drink most of it. This satisfies the higher<em>melo lugmav</em> requirement as well as Ramban<em>'s</em> condition. However, if it is difficult for him to drink an entire 150 ml "Hazon Ish            <em>shi'ur</em>" cup, he ends up losing the enhancement of drinking an entire cup. Although we have stated that one may fulfill his
            obligation <em>le-khathila </em>by using the standard <em>shi'ur</em>, one who wishes to enhance the mitzva should first satisfy all
            opinions, including the Hazon Ish <em>shi'ur</em>, and only then undertake to drink an entire cup. If he enjoys drinking wine, the greatest
            enhancement is to drink a full 150 ml cup; if he is worried that he might become intoxicated, he may mix grape juice into the wine.

            . More broadly, <em>"shi'ur akhilat pras"</em> is a unit of time within which all eating is treated as a single act. There is a dispute as to
            whether or not this time period applies to drinking as well. According to Rambam, since one drinks faster than he eats, the measurement of time for
            drinking is different than that of eating, and only uninterrupted drinking is considered as one unit. According to Raavad, the measurement of time
            for drinking is the same as for eating, and as long as one drank within a "<em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras,"</em> it is considered a single act.
            See section 25 below for a more precise definition of a "<em>pras.</em>"
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Optimally, one must drink uninterruptedly, as per Rambam, and if he drank the minimum amount within the time of <em>akhilat pras</em>, he has not
            fulfilled his obligation according to Rambam, only Raavad. But since we rule leniently when there is uncertainty pertaining to rabbinic law, one
would not have to drink again. This is what AHS 472:13 and <em>Hazon Ovadia </em>�12 state. Moreover, according to            <em>Knesset Ha-gedola, </em>SAH, and<em> Hatam Sofer, </em>Rambam only stated his opinion with regard to a forbidden drink, where one incurs lashes
if he drinks continuously. But regarding <em>berakhot </em>over consumption of food or drink, Rambam would concur that <em>shi'ur </em>            <em>akhilat pras</em> is the relevant time frame, since the determining factor of <em>berakhot</em> is enjoyment, and he certainly derives pleasure
            even if he only completes his drink during a <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em>. Accordingly, perhaps Rambam would concur that one who drinks a
            cup of wine within a <em>shi'ur</em> <em>akhilat pras</em> would fulfill his obligation. Nevertheless, some <em>poskim</em> say that where it is
            easy to fulfill one's obligation according to all opinions, one should be stringent even with regard to a disputed rabbinic law. Therefore, MA and
            SAH 472:20 and MB 472:34 state that if one drank the second cup only within the time of <em>akhilat pras</em>, he should drink it again. If it was
            the third or fourth cup, though, he should not drink again, since it would look like he was adding to the four cups. Rather, in this case he should
            rely on the opinion of Raavad that he has fulfilled his obligation (see MB 472:21 regarding the first cup). According to those who follow
            SA that one may drink after the third and fourth cups, one should re-drink any of the four cups in question, as <em>Ben Ish Hai</em> (Tzav
            29) states. This is why I wrote that some are stringent in this matter, despite the fact that this is a double uncertainty about a rabbinic law:
            according to Raavad, the obligation has certainly been fulfilled, and possibly even according to Rambam as well.

            See section 25 below and the notes <em>ad loc. </em>for the differing opinions regarding the length of <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em>. The

            lenient. Eating a <em>kezayit</em> of matza is a Torah obligation, and although reclining while eating is a rabbinic obligation, since it pertains
to a Torah obligation we are stringent, and if one ate without reclining he must eat again and recline. Conversely, eating <em>korekh</em> and            <em>afikoman</em> are rabbinic injunctions, and since according to Raavya and Raavan reclining while eating them is unnecessary, if one
            ate them without reclining, he would not have to eat again. However, since according to the overwhelming majority of <em>poskim</em> reclining is
            necessary when eating <em>korekh</em> and <em>afikoman</em> (and this is the <em>halakha</em>), and since it is an easy mitzva to redo, one should
            redo the mitzva.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Regarding <em>korekh</em>, <em>Rokei'ah</em> and <em>Shibolei Ha-leket</em> maintain that one need not recline while eating <em>korekh</em> since
            it contains <em>maror</em>. <em>Manhig</em>, though, says one should recline during <em>korekh</em>, and this is the view of most Rishonim as well
            as SA 475:1. However, if one ate <em>korekh</em> without reclining he still fulfills his obligation (<em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim </em>475:36 in the
            name of <em>Pri Hadash</em> and SAH).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
Regarding the <em>afikoman</em><strong>,</strong> SA 477:1 states that one must recline while eating the <em>afikoman</em>. <em>P</em>            <em>ri Hadash</em>, on the other hand, notes that Rambam and the Yerushalmi seem to imply that reclining while eating the <em>afikoman</em> is
            unnecessary. Based on this, MB 477:4 states that if one forgot to recline and eating another <em>kezayit </em>of <em>afikoman</em> would be
            difficult for him, he need not eat another <em>afikoman</em>. This is also the opinion of <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim </em>472:45 and 477:7.
According to <em>Hayei Adam</em> 130:13, though, even if one was able to eat another <em>afikoman, </em>it is forbidden to eat the            <em>afikoman</em> twice. MB 472:22 quotes this, which seemingly contradicts what he states in 477:4. Perhaps this can be reconciled: if one
            remembered immediately that he neglected to recline, he should continue eating another <em>kezayit</em> while reclining, but if he already finished
eating, he should not go back and eat more, since this would be considered eating the <em>afikoman</em> twice. So states            <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 22:5.

            . <em>Pesahim</em> 108a expresses uncertainty about which of the four cups require reclining - the first two or the last two -
            and concludes that one must recline while drinking all four cups. Some Rishonim ask why the Gemara rules stringently, to recline during all cups,
if the mitzva to drink the four cups is only rabbinic in origin, which should indicate a lenient ruling. Maharam Halawa, <em>Tashbetz</em>            <em>,</em> and others answer that indeed the Gemara should have been lenient, but since there is no difficulty involved in reclining, it is best to
            recline while drinking all four cups. According to this answer, if one drank the cups without reclining, he need not drink again, since, in
            principle, the Gemara would have ruled leniently were this not such an easy mitzva. In contrast, Rosh says that if one drank any of the cups
            without reclining, he must drink again. This leads us to the conclusion that the reason we recline during all four cups is not because we are in
            doubt, but because the Sages in fact decreed that this should be so. This is the opinion of SA 742:7. In practice, since Raavya 
            and Raavan maintain that there is no need to recline nowadays, and we are uncertain about whether or not one is required to drink again, one may be
            lenient. This is the opinion of <em>Birkei Yosef</em> 472:8 and <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim </em>472:42. <em>Hazon Ovadia </em>(�13), however, rules
            in accordance with SA that the leniency to not have to drink again only applies to someone who has difficulty doing so. In sum, Sephardim
            preferably follow SA that if one drank any of the cups without reclining, he has to drink again, and Ashkenazim follow Rema and only re-drink the
            second cup. However, if someone, whether Sephardic or Ashkenazic, wishes to be lenient, he may do so, since this is an uncertainty - and possibly a
            double uncertainty (<em>sfek sfeika</em>) regarding a rabbinic law.

            . <em>Pesahim</em> 108a states that a woman need not recline if she is in her husband's presence, with the exception of an important woman
            ("<em>isha hashuva</em>"). SA 472:4 rules accordingly. (The rationale is that if reclining in the manner of free people does not reflect an inner
            sense of freedom, it has no purpose. This is similar to the logic behind a disciple not reclining in the presence of his rabbi.) There are
            different opinions about what defines an <em>isha hashuva - </em>that she is not subservient to her husband, that she is wealthy, that she is
            pedigreed, or that her husband does not mind if she reclines. Rema states that all women nowadays are considered <em>hashuvot</em>, but the custom
            is nevertheless that they do not recline, as per Raavya, who says that there is no longer a mitzva to recline. In practice, all women from all
            communities should try to recline, as <em>Knesset Ha-gedola</em> and <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> (<em>ad loc. </em>28) state. Many Ashkenazic women in
            fact do so. But if a woman forgot to recline, she need not eat or drink again, since the mitzva of reclining is rabbinic, and there are
            several <em>poskim</em> who maintain that women are exempt, either because they are not <em>hashuvot</em> or because the view of Raavya is correct.
            Nonetheless, it seems that women who see themselves as important should recline while eating the Torah-mandated <em>kezayit </em>of matza and
            refrain from relying on the opinion of Raavya.

            . According to SAH 473:13 and MB 479:5, if one wants to drink "<em>hamar medina</em>" (the alcoholic non-wine beverage locally considered
significant), if it requires a new <em>berakha</em>, the beverage is prohibited, since <em>be-di'avad</em> one can fulfill the mitzva by drinking<em>hamar medina </em>for all four cups. This is the proper custom. (<em>Hemed Moshe</em> forbids even other drinks if one must make a            <em>berakha </em>on them. See <em>Kaf Ha-hayim </em>473:40. It remains unclear whether this stringency applies to the Sephardic custom, according
            to which a <em>berakha</em> is not recited before every cup.)

            . One would presumably need to recite a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>. Since the food one eats before a meal is not considered part of the
meal, he must recite a <em>berakha</em> after finishing the food before beginning the meal. This is the opinion of <em>Ben Ish Hai </em>(Naso 4),<em> Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 177:7, and <em>Or Le-Tziyon</em> 12:7. In principle, MB 176:2 also rules this way, but states that according to several            <em>poskim</em>, if the food is of a type that is not covered by the <em>berakha</em> of <em>ha-motzi</em>, such as fruit, and the person intends
            to continue eating fruit during the meal, he should not make a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>, since the <em>berakha</em> that he made on the
            fruit will include the fruit he eats during the meal. Also, since <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> covers the fruit that he ate during the meal, it will
also cover the fruit he ate before the meal. Consequently, an uncertain situation arises, since according to Rashbam the <em>berakha</em> on the<em>karpas</em> is also supposed to cover the <em>maror</em>. Therefore, SA states that one should specifically eat less than a <em>kezayit</em> of            <em>karpas</em> so that he will not have to recite a <em>berakha</em> <em>aharona</em>. If one recited a <em>berakha aharona </em>over the food he
ate after <em>kiddush</em>, that <em>berakha</em> would cover the <em>karpas</em>, and he would be required to make a new<em> berakha</em> on the            <em>maror</em>. Perhaps he can have in mind to cover everything except the <em>karpas</em> with his <em>berakha aharona</em>, but this demands
further investigation. Perhaps we may say that since he is eating after <em>kiddush</em>, the food is considered part of the meal and is covered by            <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>. The only problem is that according to many <em>poskim</em>, including <em>Ben Ish Hai </em>and <em>Kaf Ha-hayim </em>
cited above, <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> does not cover anything eaten before the meal. Moreover, even those who generally maintain that            <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> covers food eaten before the meal, at the Seder there is a large break between the food eaten after <em>kiddush</em> and
the meal, so it would seem that everyone would agree that in this case <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> does not cover anything eaten before the meal (            <em>Yehaveh Da'at </em>1:2). Indeed, <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> covers the wine that one drinks for the first cup, but this wine is different,
            because it is certainly connected to the meal, since the recitation of <em>kiddush</em> over this wine specifically allows one to partake in the
meal. On the other hand, food that is eaten after <em>kiddush</em> might not be connected to the meal. In practice, one who eats after<em>kiddush </em>must recite a <em>berakha aharona</em> ("<em>borei nefashot</em>"), but should not recite a <em>borei pri ha-adama </em>on the            <em>maror</em>. See R. Harari's <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh </em>ch. 4, nn. 141 and 142.

            . The laws of year-round foods dipped in liquid are discussed in SA 158:4, which rules that one must wash his hands without a <em>berakha</em>
            before eating them. However, MA cites <em>Lehem Hamudot</em> that many do not wash their hands before eating foods dipped in liquid, and that they
            may rely on the minority of Rishonim who maintain that this law does not apply nowadays. SAH 158:3 states that we do not reprimand people who act
            this way, though it is better to wash one's hands. MB 158:20 states that many Aharonim are stringent in this matter, though in practice
            many people are lenient, including many Torah scholars. They presumably base this lenient practice on the principle that when there is an
uncertainty regarding a rabbinic law, we are lenient, since washing hands before eating is a rabbinic injunction (<em>Peninei Halakha:</em><em>Berakhot </em>2:5). If so, however, why do we deviate from the standard practice on Pesah night and wash our hands before eating            <em>karpas</em>? See <em>Taz</em> 473:6, which uses this question to prove that we should be careful to wash our hands all year round. Netziv
            states in his Hagada<em>, Imrei Shefer</em>, that this is not a valid question, since during the Seder we do many things that used to be done
            during Temple times, including this hand washing.

. See <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> pp. 184-187 and <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 2:5:3 regarding the opinions about and customs of eating            <em>karpas</em>. In general, the advantage of eating celery or parsley, in addition to the fact that they are actually <em>karpas</em>, is that
they are eaten raw and stimulate the appetite. Moreover, they are usually eaten in small amounts, which makes it easier to eat less than a            <em>kezayit</em>, as will be explained below. On the other hand, in Ashkenazic communities they were not generally eaten raw, and consequently one
who eats them raw should recite the <em>berakha </em>of "<em>she-hakol.</em>" But the <em>berakha </em>on <em>karpas </em>must be "            <em>ha-adama.</em>" Therefore, the custom in Ashkenazic communities is to eat cooked potatoes for <em>karpas</em>, on which the <em>berakha</em> is
undoubtedly "<em>ha-adama.</em>" In Middle Eastern and North African communities, where celery and parsley were eaten raw, one recites "            <em>ha-adama</em>" over them.

        <p align="left">
            It is worth adding that one should not use any food for <em>karpas</em> that is normally eaten outside the context of a meal - bananas and
            pineapples, for example - since it is not clear that they are being used as appetizers; rather, they look like separate foods that are eaten by
            themselves, do not seem different, and do not provoke questions. Vegetables, however, are usually eaten in the middle of the meal, so eating them
            before the meal is a change.

            . This dispute hinges on whether one must recite a <em>berakha</em> on the <em>maror</em>. According to Rashbam, a <em>berakha</em> is necessary,
            since the <em>berakha</em> of "<em>ha-motzi</em>" over the matza covers everything that will be eaten during the meal, meaning anything that is
eaten with matza to provide satisfaction. But <em>maror</em> is not eaten for this purpose, so it is not covered by the <em>berakha</em> of            <em>ha-motzi</em>. Therefore, one must have in mind when making the <em>berakha</em> on the <em>karpas</em> to cover the <em>maror</em> as well. By
doing this, he exempts himself from making a separate <em>berakha</em> on the <em>maror.</em> However, according to Ri, one need not make a<em>berakha</em> on <em>maror</em> at all, since it is considered a food that is eaten in the context of the meal and hence is covered by the            <em>berakha</em> on the matza. Accordingly, if one eats more than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em>, he must recite a <em>berakha aharona</em>.
He should not wait until <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>, since it only covers food that was eaten during the meal, not before it. So if one eats a<em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em> and does not recite a <em>berakha aharona </em>right away, he misses his opportunity to make the            <em>berakha</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
Nevertheless, <em>be-di'avad</em>, if one ate more than a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em>, he should not recite a <em>berakha</em>            <em>aharona</em>. This is because we are lenient in laws of <em>berakhot</em> in cases of uncertainty. On the one hand, perhaps Rashbam is correct
            that the <em>berakha</em> on the <em>karpas</em> covers the <em>maror</em>, and since <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> covers the <em>maror</em>, it also
            covers the <em>karpas</em>, which is connected to the <em>maror. </em>(See BHL 473:6, which cites Gra that one must make a <em>berakha </em>and
            concludes that the matter must be explored further. Nevertheless, practically speaking, one should not recite a <em>berakha </em>about which there
is doubt.) On the other hand, if one ate a <em>kezayit</em> and recited a <em>berakha aharona</em> afterward, he should not recite a            <em>berakha</em> on the <em>maror</em>, since perhaps Ri is correct that the <em>berakha</em> on the matza covers the <em>maror</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
If it is true that one must eat less than a <em>kezayit </em>of <em>karpas</em>, why is one required to wash his hands? We know (SA 158:3;<em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>2:6) that one only needs to wash hands for a piece of bread larger than a <em>kezayit </em>-<em>kal va-homer </em>that one need not wash for a food dipped in liquid. Indeed, according to Rambam (MT Laws of <em>Hametz</em>             and Matza 8:2) and many other Rishonim, one should specifically eat a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>karpas</em> (in a responsum he
            instructed his correspondent to recite a <em>berakha aharona </em>afterward). This was in fact the practice of the Vilna Gaon and several
            other Aharonim (although it is unknown whether they recited a <em>berakha aharona</em> afterward). BHL 473:6 leaves this issue unresolved. Perhaps
            according to Netziv (cited above in n. 12), who says that we wash our hands before <em>karpas</em> to remember what used to be done in the Temple,
            we can suggest that in the times of the Temple people would eat pieces larger than a <em>kezayit</em>, and they knew whether or not to
recite a <em>berakha aharona</em>. Nowadays, however, since we do not know whether to recite a <em>berakha aharona</em>, we eat less than a            <em>kezayit</em> to avoid uncertainty, and although technically we need not wash our hands to eat less than a <em>kezayit</em>, we do so anyway to
commemorate what was done in the Temple. See also <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> 158:20, which states that there are some who learned from the status of<em>karpas </em>that the law of washing for vegetables is different than the law of washing for bread: for bread one only washes for a            <em>kezayit</em>, but for vegetables one washes even for less than a <em>kezayit</em>.

            . It is worth adding here that many families customarily prolong the recitation of the Hagada beyond seventy-two minutes, which is the time it
takes to digest and is generally considered the amount of time that constitutes an interruption, after which one may not recite a            <em>berakha aharona</em>. It would seem, then, that an extended recitation of the Hagada would mean that <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> does not cover
            the first cup of wine, in which case one will not have recited a <em>berakha aharona</em> over the first cup of wine. Moreover, according to MA
            184:9, if one waited for this amount of time between the first and second cups, he must recite a new <em>berakha</em>, which contradicts the ruling
            of SA that one need not recite a new <em>berakha </em>over the second cup (since the <em>berakha</em> on the first cup covers it).
            Additionally, how does this issue fit with Rashbam's ruling that the <em>berakha</em> recited on the <em>karpas</em> also covers the <em>maror</em>
            ? How can this work if more than seventy-two minutes have elapsed? This question is also raised in SA 473:6, which takes the view of Rashbam into
consideration. Furthermore, the first cup is also <em>kiddush</em>, which must be part of a meal. When there is such a long break, perhaps            <em>kiddush </em>must be recited again, so that it is part of the meal. Because of all of these problems, some <em>poskim</em> maintain that one
            should be careful to recite the Hagada in less than seventy-two minutes (see <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 3:9). Notwithstanding these concerns,
many people still prolong the recitation of the Hagada for more than seventy-two minutes (see <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> 2:30,            <em>Hilkhot Hag Be-hag</em> 20:5, and <em>Responsa</em> <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> �11, which justify this practice based on various rationales, such as
            explaining that the <em>berakha aharona</em> on the fourth cup also covers the first cup). In my humble opinion, the entire issue of a significant
            interruption ("<em>hefsek</em>") in a meal only applies when one engages in unrelated activities (even if he does not take his mind off
            the meal). In this case, though, he is not dealing with unrelated issues; rather, he is involved in the Seder and the Hagada. Therefore, since the
            second cup is poured right at the beginning of the recitation of the Hagada, and since the entire recitation of the Hagada is connected to the
second cup, the time between the first and second cups is not considered a <em>hefsek</em>. Consequently, there is no <em>hefsek</em> between            <em>kiddush</em> and the meal; the recitation of the Hagada is considered part of the Seder, since telling the story of the Exodus is an integral
            part of the mitzva of eating matza. Similarly, telling the Exodus story is also inherently connected to the mitzva of eating <em>maror</em>, so the
recitation of the Hagada does not constitute a <em>hefsek</em> between the eating of <em>karpas </em>and the eating of <em>maror</em> (and the            <em>berakha</em> on <em>karpas</em> covers the <em>maror</em> as well).

            that belongs to them. See <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 2:8:3. Nevertheless, one who eats matza owned by the head of the household fulfills his

            . The size of a <em>kezayit </em>is a very long topic, and is explained in <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>10:5-6 and in the notes
            there. I will summarize it here.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            SA 486:1 rules that regarding the requirement to eat matza, we follow <em>Tosafot </em>that a <em>kezayit</em> is the size of half an egg's bulk.
SAH (486:1) states that for Torah commandments, one must be stringent and follow <em>Tosafot</em>, but for rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em>, such as            <em>eiruvin</em>, one may follow the lenient opinion of Rambam, who maintains that a <em>kezayit</em> is slightly less than a third of an
            egg's bulk. MB 486:1 states that when it comes to reciting a <em>berakha aharona</em>, which is only required if one eats a <em>kezayit</em>, one
            must follow <em>Tosafot</em>, since we are lenient whenever there is uncertainty in the laws of <em>berakhot</em>. Thus, one is only required to
            recite a <em>berakha aharona</em> if he eats at least half an egg's bulk, not less. <em>Le-khathila </em>one should not invite an ambiguous
            situation, and should eat either less than one third of an egg's bulk, in which case he would be exempt from a <em>berakha aharona </em>according
            to everyone, or more than half an egg's bulk, in which case he would be required to recite a <em>berakha aharona</em> according to everyone.
            Regarding matza, one must be stringent and follow the opinion of <em>Tosafot</em>. Similarly, one must follow the opinion of <em>Tosafot</em>
            vis-a-vis <em>maror</em>, since we recite a <em>berakha</em> on it. On the other hand, when it comes to the requirement to eat a <em>kezayit</em>
            of <em>korekh</em> and the requirement to eat a <em>kezayit</em> of <em>afikoman</em>, one may be lenient and follow Rambam.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            BHL on 271 explains the opinion of <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>. MB (486:1) quotes <em>Sha'arei Teshuva</em> that regarding Torah commandments,
            including <em>mitzvot</em> like <em>kiddush </em>with a biblical basis, one should be stringent and follow <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>. On the other
            hand, vis-a-vis rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em> like the four cups of wine, one need not follow <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda.</em> MB (<em>ibid.</em>) also states
            that regarding <em>berakha aharona</em> one need not follow <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>; rather, he should recite a <em>berakha aharona</em> after
            eating the amount of half an egg, as per <em>Tosafot</em>. Sephardim do not show any concern for <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>'s measurements, since the
            tradition regarding halakhic measurements was passed down, uninterrupted, in the regions near Eretz Yisrael, and every time the sizes were
            recalculated, the same results were found.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            It should also be noted that there are two opinions within the view of <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em> that the <em>kezayit</em> of <em>Tosafot </em>is the
            size of a modern-day egg: according to MB this means an egg with its shell, and according to <em>Hazon Ish</em> this means an egg without its
            shell; the difference between these two opinions is about ten percent.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            MB 486:3 states that one must realize that all of these measurements are based on volume, and only when there are large air pockets is one required
            to compress the food. The food's natural texture does not need to be compressed. Therefore, the weight of a <em>kezayit</em> often varies,
            depending on the density of the food.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            After measuring, it emerges that a <em>kezayit</em> according to <em>Tosafot, </em>which is the size of half a modern-day egg, is at most a third
of a machine-made matza. If we multiply this <em>shi'ur </em>based on MB's stringent explanation of <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>, namely, that a<em>kezayit </em>is the size of a whole egg with its shell, a <em>kezayit </em>is approximately two-thirds of a machine-made matza. According to            <em>Hazon Ish</em>'s understanding of <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda, </em>roughly half of a machine-made matza is sufficient, or, according to some, slightly
            more than half. In any case, one who eats two-thirds of a machine-made matza fulfills his obligation according to even the most stringent opinions
            (the weight of a machine-made matza is approximately 33 grams). See <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato </em>2:8:4, which explains the calculations
            practically.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
After reciting the <em>berakha</em>, one must eat two <em>kezeytim </em>(SA 475:1 citing Rosh and <em>Mordechai</em>). One            <em>kezayit</em> is taken from the top, whole matza for the <em>berakha</em> of "<em>ha-motzi,</em>" and one <em>kezayit</em> is taken from the
            middle, broken matza for the <em>berakha</em> of "<em>al akhilat matza.</em>" BHL questions this ruling, since it does not seem that any
            other Rishonim require eating two <em>kezayit</em>-sized pieces. Nevertheless, the custom is to follow SA. However, one certainly does not need to
            be stringent in measuring the two pieces; therefore, if he ate a <em>kezayit</em> according to the measurement of <em>Noda Bi-Yehuda</em>, he has
            already fulfilled the obligation to eat two <em>kezayit</em>-sized pieces according to the accepted measurement (that of <em>Tosafot</em>) and has
            eaten more than three <em>kezayit</em> sizes according to the measurement of Rambam.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
One who has difficulty eating two-thirds of a machine-made matza may eat one third and may recite the <em>berakha</em> of "            <em>al akhilat matza,</em>" since, as we already mentioned, technically the <em>halakha</em> follows the accepted measurement (<em>Tosafot</em>),
            and even regarding <em>berakha aharona</em> one need not follow <em>Hazon Ish</em> (with the exception of his students and followers). Regarding
            the practice to eat two <em>kezeytim</em>, we have already mentioned that not all Rishonim agree that this is a requirement; moreover, one third of
            a machine-made matza likely contains two <em>kezayit</em> sizes according to Rambam<em>. </em>Therefore, one who eats one third altogether should
            eat a small piece from the whole matza and a small piece from the broken matza.

            . The vast majority of Rishonim maintain that <em>shi'urim </em>are calculated by volume. This is the ruling of <em>Yehaveh Da'at</em>
4:55 regarding the minimum <em>shi'ur </em>for the tithing of <em>halla</em>. See the addendum "<em>Shi'ur Kezayit</em>" at the back of R. Harari's            <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> part 4 and 6:3. See also <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>10:6, 7 and the expanded notes <em>ad loc</em>.
            Nevertheless, Sephardic Aharonim customarily calculate a <em>kezayit </em>by weight, as Hida writes in <em>Mahzik Berakha</em> 168:6; see
            also <em>Kaf Ha-hayim</em> (168:45-46 and 486:1, 3) which cites more sources. This is also the ruling of R. Ovadia Yosef and R. Mordechai Eliyahu.
            Some <em>poskim</em> raise the possibility that <em>shi'urim </em>should be calculated by weight even in principle, since perhaps volume must be
            calculated after the food has been compressed, and a <em>kezayit </em>of fully compressed food will have the same weight as water. However, it is
            clear that the real justification for measuring by weight is that it is easier. Therefore, even a Sephardic Jew who normally measures by weight may
rely on a volume-based measurement for matza. Indeed, R. Ben-Zion Abba Shaul and R. Shalom Messas maintain that one should calculate by volume            <em>le-khathila</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Additionally, since our custom is to eat two <em>kezayit</em>-sized pieces initially, one must eat two-thirds of a machine-made matza. Even
            according to the weight-based measurement, two-thirds of a machine-made matza constitutes a <em>kezayit</em> according to Rambam<em>.</em>
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            It should also be noted that according to the latest calculations of Rambam's opinion, it emerges that the weight of half an egg is c. 25 grams,
            not 27, 28, or 29 grams as calculated by those who follow R. Hayim Naeh. See <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>10:6, 11. Nevertheless,
the key point is that we calculate by volume, and by eating one third of a machine�-made matza<em>,</em> one removes all doubt. See            <em>Sidur Pesah Ke-hilkhato</em> 2:8:4. Sephardim who eat thick, soft matza may also calculate by volume, since this is the primary halakhic
method. However, it is easier to eat a weight-based (25 gm) <em>kezayit </em>of this matza. After the initial <em>berakhot</em>, when we eat two            <em>kezeytim</em>, one may use Rambam's <em>kezayit</em>, which is less than a third of an egg, and c. 30 gm of matza would suffice in this
            instance.

            . As we have seen, according to Rashi, a <em>pras</em> is the size of four eggs, and according to <em>Tosafot</em>, a <em>kezayit</em> is
            half an egg. Thus, a <em>pras</em> is eight <em>kezeytim</em>. According to Rambam, a <em>pras</em> is the size of three eggs, and each egg is a
            bit more than three <em>kezeytim</em>. Thus, a <em>pras</em> is just over nine <em>kezeytim</em>. (If we combine Rashi's <em>pras </em>with
Rambam's <em>kezayit</em>, a <em>pras </em>would come out to be twelve <em>kezeytim</em>. If we combine Rambam's <em>pras </em>with the            <em>kezayit </em>of <em>Tosafot</em>, a <em>pras</em> would be six <em>kezeytim</em>.)
        </p>
        <p align="left">
Although some individuals measured and discovered that they could not eat a <em>kezayit</em> of matza within a <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em>, they only reached this conclusion because they used conflicting measurements. On the one hand, they measured a            <em>kezayit</em> according to the most stringent opinion possible - a Hazon Ish <em>shi'ur </em>calculated by weight - and on the other hand, they
            calculated a <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em> based on the smallest possible measure - Rambam's <em>shi'ur</em> of three eggs, calculated by
            volume. These two measurements are contradictory: a Hazon Ish <em>kezayit</em> by weight is c. 50 grams, while the three eggs' volume of matza is
            c. 54 grams. Since matza is difficult to chew, and a <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em> is calculated based on the time it takes to eat bread
            that is easy to chew and swallow, these individuals discovered that they could not finish that "<em>kezayit</em>" in time. According to this, the
            Sephardic custom to eat two weight-based <em>kezayit</em>-sized pieces, or c. 58 grams of matza, in the time it takes to eat three eggs, or c. 54
grams, is certainly impossible under normal circumstances. Rather, one must calculate the size of a <em>kezayit</em> and the            <em>shi'ur akhilat pras </em>using the same standard: if one is stringent regarding the size of a <em>kezayit</em> (and measures it by weight), he
            must allow himself more time to eat it by calculating the size of an egg based on weight as well, meaning that a <em>shi'ur akhilat pras</em> would
            be fifteen minutes or more.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Therefore, anyone who eats casually, provided that he does not pause or excessively procrastinate in his eating, will certainly be able to finish
            the <em>kezayit</em> within a <em>shi'ur</em> <em>akhilat pras</em>; thus, there is no need to glance at one's watch while eating.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Nevertheless, if one paused while eating and did not finish one third of a matza within four minutes, he should act stringently and eat another
            piece in that time. Logic dictates that since the determination of <em>shi'ur akhilat pras </em>is based on the average person, and since there are
so many measurements offered, we should calculate it based on the median of the opinions of the Aharonim (6-7 minutes). However, since the mitzva             of eating matza is from the Torah, one should follow the strictest opinions. See <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>10:7, 8.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Additionally, according to <em>Minhat Hinukh</em> and <em>R</em><em>esponsa Torat Hessed </em>OH 32, the <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em> is
            determined separately for every food, based on the ease or difficulty of eating it. Accordingly, the <em>shi'ur</em> <em>akhilat pras</em> for
matza would be longer than usual, since matza is difficult to chew and swallow. Nevertheless, most <em>poskim</em> who determined a            <em>shi'ur </em><em>akhilat pras</em> understood that it is a fixed standard based on the eating of regular bread.

            . See <em>Hazon Ish </em>OH 124, commenting on <em>Pesahim</em> 39a. Ridbaz states that lettuce might not be <em>maror</em> at all. Nevertheless,
            most <em>poskim</em>, including Maharam Halawa and <em>Tashbetz</em>, believe that lettuce is the best type of <em>maror</em>,
            because the Gemara finds allusions in its name and because it alludes to the enslavement by its very nature - starting off soft and sweet. This is
the ruling in SA 473:5, <em>Pri Hadash</em> 472:5, and SAH 472:30. Additionally, according to Raavya and<em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em> (quoted by <em>Tur</em> and SA), whatever is mentioned first in the Mishna is the preferable choice for            <em>maror</em>, and lettuce (which the Mishna calls "<em>hazeret</em>" even though "<em>hazeret</em>" in modern Hebrew is horseradish) is in fact
            mentioned first. <em>Responsa</em> <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> �35 expands on this topic.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            We should also add that another opinion appears in a <em>beraita </em>in <em>Pesahim</em> 39a: any bitter vegetable that exudes latex and has a
            blanched complexion (i.e., it is whitish-green) is <em>maror</em>. The Rishonim debated this: according to Ri'az, Maharam Halawa, and others, any
            vegetable that has these characteristics is indeed <em>maror</em>. According to <em>Smak</em>, on the other hand, these characteristics are just
features common to the five types of vegetables mentioned in the Mishna, but no vegetable outside what is listed in the Mishna is acceptable for            <em>maror.</em> Rif and Rambam do not mention these characteristics, either because they maintain that only the five vegetables listed in
            the Mishna are acceptable, and these characteristics consequently are meaningless, or because they maintain that we are not experts in identifying
            these characteristics, so we have no ability to determine what other vegetables are fit for <em>maror</em>. Practically, one who does not have
            lettuce or horseradish should use another vegetable that has these characteristics, but should not recite a <em>berakha</em> over it, in case we
            are not adept at identifying these characteristics or it is not one of the five acceptable species. This is the ruling in MB 473:46 and

ingredient separately, he does not fulfill his obligation according to Rashbam and Ramban, while according to <em>Tosafot </em>and            <em>Ha-ma'or</em>, he fulfills his obligation <em>be-di'avad</em>. As for the Sages' position, if one ate them together he does not fulfill his

            . I explained the basics of this issue in n. 20 above. We learned there that according to Rambam<em>, </em>a<em> kezayit</em> is slightly less than
            one third of an egg, while according to <em>Tosafot </em>it is c. half an egg. Since we are stringent and follow <em>Tosafot</em> vis-a-vis Torah
            commandments, one should eat one third of a matza for every <em>kezayit</em>. However, regarding <em>korekh</em> and <em>afikoman</em>, which are
            rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em>, if one has difficulty following <em>Tosafot</em>, he may follow Rambam and eat approximately one fifth of a matza, which
            is about one third of an egg. Even those who wish to eat two <em>kezayit</em>-sized pieces for <em>afikoman</em> may suffice with a fifth of a
            matza, which contains two <em>kezeytim</em> according to many Ge'onim and Rishonim (see <em>Peninei Halakha:</em> <em>Berakhot </em>10:6) who
maintain that a <em>kezayit</em> is the size of an average contemporary olive. Regarding the stringency of eating two <em>kezeytim </em>for the            <em>afikoman</em>, one need not adopt the larger measurement of a <em>kezayit</em>.

further attested that R. Hayim Volozhiner and the author of <em>Avnei Nezer </em>ruled according to this opinion. See <em>Peninei Halakha:</em>            <em>Berakhot</em> 10:5-6 and in the expanded notes, and in the addendum to <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> 5. Nevertheless, the standard ruling is to be
            stringent and follow the opinion of <em>Tosafot </em>that a <em>kezayit </em>is half an egg, as explained in n. 20. Even if one cannot eat the
            requisite amount of matza according to any opinion, he should at least taste some matza, as per <em>Mahzik Berakha </em>�475 and AHS

. A detailed explanation: On three occasions, the Mishna quotes the opinion of R. Elazar b. Azarya anonymously and without dissent -            <em>Berakhot</em> 2a, <em>Pesahim</em> 120b, and <em>Zevahim </em>56b - and R. Akiva's opinion anonymously and without dissent only once,
in <em>Megilla </em>20b. Rosh (<em>Pesahim </em>10:38) wonders how that single <em>mishna </em>in <em>Megilla</em> could outweigh the three            <em>mishnayot </em>that follow the opinion of R. Elazar b. Azarya. Consequently, Rosh says that although R. Akiva maintains that on the Torah
            level, the mitzva of eating the <em>korban Pesah</em> applies all night, he concurs that, on the rabbinic level, one must finish eating it before
            midnight. Therefore, Rosh states that one must eat the <em>afikoman</em> before midnight, and this is the ruling of SA 477:1. However, it
            is said that Hatam Sofer, Netziv, and other great scholars did not insist on finishing the <em>afikoman</em> before midnight. Since this is a
dispute about a matter of rabbinic law, one may be lenient. Even SA might mean that one finishes the <em>afikoman</em> before midnight            <em>le-khathila</em>, but it is not an absolute requirement. <em>Responsa</em> <em>Avnei Nezer</em> �381 recommends that one who is in the middle
of his meal and sees that midnight is approaching should eat a <em>kezayit</em> of matza while reclining and make the following stipulation: If the            <em>halakha</em> follows the opinion of R. Elazar b. Azarya, this <em>kezayit</em> should be the <em>afikoman</em>, but if the <em>halakha</em>
            follows R. Akiva, the <em>kezayit</em> that will be eaten after the meal (at its normal place in the meal) should be the <em>afikoman</em>. This
            stipulation is based on a novel interpretation: the requirement that the taste of the matza remains in one's mouth only applies during the time of
            the mitzva, which according to R. Elazar b. Azarya ends at midnight<em>. </em>Thus, according to R. Elazar b. Azarya, one would be able to continue
            eating after midnight, when the time for the mitzva of <em>afikoman</em> ends.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            However, one certainly must ensure that he eats a <em>kezayit </em>of matza before midnight, since eating a <em>kezayit </em>of matza is a Torah
commandment, and hence one must be stringent. One must even be stringent vis-a-vis the mitzva of <em>maror</em>, since he cannot recite the            <em>berakha</em> on it after midnight, as explained in MB 477:6 and BHL <em>ad loc.</em> <em>Responsa</em> <em>Mishkenot Yaakov</em> �139 and other
            Aharonim attempt to prove that the <em>halakha</em> follows Rambam. Nonetheless, the law still remains unclear, so one should not recite
            the <em>berakhot</em> on matza or <em>maror</em> after midnight and must likewise take care to fulfill the Torah obligation of matza before
            midnight<em>. </em>MB further states that if one begins late and does not have time to complete the recitation of the Hagada before midnight, he
should eat the matza and <em>maror</em>, with <em>berakhot</em>, right after <em>kiddush</em>, and then recite the Hagada. <em>Kaf</em>            <em> Ha-hayim </em>477:10 echoes this idea, but rules that one may not recite the <em>Birkat Ha-ge'ula</em> (just before the second cup) after
            midnight, since we are lenient in a case of uncertainty regarding <em>berakhot</em>. See <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> vol. 2 p. 166, which agrees with MB
            and rules that one may recite <em>Birkat Ha-ge'ula</em> after midnight<em>.</em> Regarding the concluding <em>berakha </em>of <em>Hallel</em>, MB
            477:7 and SHT 6 <em>ad loc.</em> cite <em>Hok Yaakov</em> that one may recite it after midnight. R. Harari's <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em>, ch. 6 n. 70
            demonstrates that <em>be-di'avad </em>one may recite <em>Birkat Ha-ge'ula </em>and the concluding <em>berakha</em> of <em>Hallel</em> after
            midnight.

            . Grilled and smoked meats are considered roasted and are prohibited. R. Harari states in <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> p. 488 that there are opinions
            that consider baked meat to be roasted. According to most <em>poskim</em>, frying is not like roasting. See AHS 486:4.

. SA states that one must eat a <em>kezayit</em> of matza for <em>afikoman. Darkhei Moshe</em> quotes Maharil that one must eat two            <em>kezeytim </em>for <em>afikoman</em>, and similarly, MB states in 477:1 "<em>le-khathila</em>, one should take two <em>kezeytim.</em>"
            This is also the opinion of <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim </em>477:1. <em>Sefer Ha-hinukh</em> �21 implies that one can fulfill his obligation with
less than a <em>kezayit</em>, and AHS 477:3 states that in an extreme situation one may use less than a <em>kezayit</em>, since the            <em>afikoman </em>is only intended to commemorate the <em>korban Pesah</em>. <em>Responsa</em> <em>Hazon Ovadia</em> �44 expands on this topic and
            presents other opinions, concluding that the mitzva is to eat one <em>kezayit</em>, although one who wishes to be stringent should follow MB.
            Several Aharonim write that the one may have in mind to fulfill both intentions with just one <em>kezayit</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Regarding the size of a <em>kezayit</em>, see above section 23 and nn. 20 and 25, where we wrote that in unclear situations regarding Torah
            commandments or <em>mitzvot</em> that require <em>berakhot</em> we follow the stringent view of <em>Tosafot</em> - that a <em>kezayit</em>
            is the volume of half an egg. On the other hand, in unclear situations vis-a-vis rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em> with no <em>berakhot</em> we
            may follow the lenient view of Rambam - that a <em>kezayit</em> is less than one third of an egg, or c. one fifth of a machine matza. Therefore,
regarding the rabbinic mitzva of eating the <em>afikoman</em>, for which only a minority of <em>poskim</em> maintain that one must eat two            <em>kezeytim</em>, one may certainly fulfill the stringent opinion that eating two <em>kezeytim </em>of <em>afikoman</em> can be fulfilled by
            eating one fifth of a matza, since according to many Ge'onim and Rishonim a <em>kezayit </em>is the size of a common olive. One fifth of a matza
            thus constitutes several <em>kezeytim </em>by this standard. Regarding <em>shi'ur akhilat pras</em>, see above section 25 and n. 22.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
See section 25 for a discussion of the measurement of <em>akhilat pras</em>; in general, the most stringent opinion is that the time of            <em>akhilat pras</em> is four minutes, and the median opinion is that it is between six and seven minutes. Since <em>afikoman</em> is a rabbinical
            decree and no <em>berakha</em> is recited on it, one can eat the <em>afikoman</em> in 6-7 minutes, and even if he ate it in nine minutes, he
            fulfills his obligation, since we follow the lenient view in an unclear situation vis-a-vis rabbinic <em>mitzvot</em> with no <em>berakhot</em>.

            . The issue in brief: According to the text of the Bavli used by Rashi and Rashbam, the Gemara does not mention a fifth cup at all, meaning that it
            would certainly be forbidden to add to the mitzva of drinking four cups by adding a fifth cup. However, according to the text of Rabbeinu Hananel,
            Rif, and Rambam, a <em>beraita </em>in <em>Pesahim</em> 118a states: "One recites <em>Hallel Ha-gadol </em>over the fifth [cup] - these
            are the words of R. Tarfon." According to <em>Ha-ma'or</em>, R. Tarfon disagrees with the <em>mishna</em> (<em>Pesahim</em> 99b) that obligates
            giving paupers enough money to buy four cups of wine, implying that there is no fifth cup; the <em>halakha </em>would follow the <em>mishna</em>,
as it is anonymous and does not acknowledge dissenting opinions. However, according to Ran<em>, </em>there is no dispute between R. Tarfon and the<em>m</em><em>ishna</em>; therefore, one must drink four cups and may - and perhaps even must - drink a fifth. Raavad (in his glosses to            <em>Ha-ma'or</em>) states, and Rambam implies, that it is a mitzva to drink a fifth cup. <em>Mordechai</em> states that the main obligation is to
            drink four cups, but the Sages made an allowance for those who wish to drink more wine, that they may recite <em>Hallel </em>over the fourth cup
and <em>Hallel Ha-gadol</em> over a fifth. This is what Rema states in 481:1, but SA does not mention a fifth cup at all. According to            <em>Kaf</em><em> Ha-hayim</em> (6 <em>ad loc</em>.), the implication of SA is that drinking a fifth cup is prohibited.

            . Some have the custom of pouring the wine from Eliyahu's Cup back into the bottle right after the Seder (this is the custom of Chabad). Others
            have the custom to add the wine from Eliyahu's Cup to the fourth cup; see <em>Piskei Teshuvot</em> 480:1.

            Regarding the symbolism of the fifth cup, my ideas echo what Maharal writes in <em>Gevurot Hashem</em> at the end of a brief section on
the laws of Pesah. He cryptically states that the fifth cup symbolizes livelihood that comes from God. See R. Goren's            <em>Torat Ha-Shabbat Ve-hamo'ed</em>, pp. 145-154, where he explains that the fifth cup represents the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael, a
            mitzva that requires total devotion on our part. R. Goren states that the fifth cup is not an obligation because it is on a higher level than
            ordinary obligations. He encourages drinking the fifth cup nowadays, since we are actively involved in settling Eretz Yisrael.

. If one accidentally ate after the <em>afikoman</em>, as long as he did not recite <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em> he should eat another piece of            <em>shmura </em>matza for <em>afikoman</em>, as per MB 478:1. If he already recited <em>Birkat Ha-mazon</em>, he need not re-wash
            his hands and eat another <em>afikoman</em> (MB 478:12), as explained in R. Harari's <em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em> ch. 9 n. 50.

            . According to <em>Ha-ma'or</em> and several other Rishonim, once the Seder has ended there is no reason to refrain from drinking wine,
            even if it will cause one to become intoxicated. Conversely, <em>Mordechai </em>and <em>Hagahot Maimoniyot</em> state that even drinking water is
            forbidden. Most Aharonim follow the opinion of Rosh and Ran that either out of concern that one will become intoxicated and will not be
            able to continue delving into Pesah topics, or out of concern that he will appear to be adding on to the four cups, one may not drink any alcoholic
            beverage, including <em>hamar medina </em>(see section 13 above, n. 10). Some <em>poskim</em> follow Rif and Mahari Weil, who maintain
that one is only permitted to drink water, since water has no taste and will not ruin the aftertaste of the <em>afikoman</em>. Accordingly,            <em>Knesset Ha-gedola</em> and <em>Ma'amar Mordechai</em> prohibit drinking coffee or other flavored drinks after the Seder. On the other hand,
            some Aharonim, including MA (481:1), reason that even according to Mahari Weil one may drink a beverage with a weak taste, and the
            prohibition is only on drinking beverages that have a strong flavor. According to this, the status of coffee requires clarification. Regardless,
            according to most Rishonim, one may drink coffee or juice, since these drinks are not intoxicating and it does not appear that one who drinks them
            is adding to the four cups. It is told that Hatam Sofer would drink coffee after the Seder every year. <em>Hazon Ovadia </em>1:50 discusses this
            topic at length and rules leniently that one may drink coffee. According to SAH (481:1), MB (481:1), and <em>Ben Ish Hai </em>(Tzav 35), one should
            preferably be stringent and refrain from drinking coffee and flavored drinks, but they permit it when there is a great necessity. As I have
            written, if by drinking coffee one will be able to study Torah, he should certainly drink coffee, even <em>le-khathila</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            According to <em>Hok Yaakov </em>481:1, since the main reason not to drink strong beverages is to avoid drowsiness, once one is drowsy he may even
            drink alcoholic beverages. Many Aharonim cite this view. SAH (481:1) also quotes this opinion, and adds that according to those who
            prohibit drinking because the beverages ruin the taste of the <em>afikoman</em>, the prohibition applies all night. Accordingly, it is clear that
            one may not eat throughout the night, since that would certainly ruin the aftertaste of the <em>afikoman</em>. In an extreme situation, one may be
lenient based on the opinion of <em>Avnei Nezer</em> (OH 381), which maintains that according to R. Elazar b. Azarya, since the time for eating the            <em>korban Pesah</em> (and the <em>afikoman</em>) ends at midnight, the prohibition against eating afterward ends at midnight as well. Therefore,
in extenuating circumstances, since this is only a rabbinic injunction, one may rely on <em>Avnei Nezer</em>'s explanation of R. Elazar b.             Azarya's view.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            According to the custom of the Sephardim, who do not recite a <em>berakha</em> on the fourth cup of wine, one who wishes to drink water between the
            third and fourth cups does not recite a <em>berakha</em> on it (provided that he had in mind to drink water or the water was in front of him),
            since the <em>berakha</em> on the third cup covers the fourth cup and any other beverage. According to Ashkenazic custom, the <em>berakha</em> on
            the third cup does not cover the fourth cup; therefore, one cannot drink water without a <em>berakha</em> between the third and fourth cups, even
            if the water was in front of him, since we assume that when he drinks the water he is no longer thinking about the <em>berakha</em> he made on the
            third cup.
